      "text": " Multibillion-dollar Indian energy giant Tata Power announced on Friday that it is dealing with a cyberattack impacting some of its systems.A spokesperson for the company told The Record that the attack targeted its IT infrastructure, but added that critical systems haven't been disrupted.“The Company has taken steps to retrieve and restore the systems,” the spokesperson said. “All critical operational systems are functioning; however, as a measure of abundant precaution, restricted access and preventive checks have been put in place for employee and customer facing portals and touch points.”The spokesperson declined to comment on whether it was a ransomware attack, nor did they say who may have been behind the hack, only adding that the company will provide updates at a later date.The company – one arm of Indian conglomerate Tata Group – reported a revenue of $5.3 billion in the most recent fiscal year and runs major power plants in Gujarat, Mumbai, Jharkhand and 32 other locations across India. The company also has operations in South Africa, Indonesia, Singapore and Bhutan.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Almost 900 servers have been hacked using a critical Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) vulnerability, which at the time was a zero-day without a patch for nearly 1.5 months.The vulnerability tracked as CVE-2022-41352 is a remote code execution flaw that allows attackers to send an email with a malicious archive attachment that plants a web shell in the ZCS server while, at the same time, bypassing antivirus checks.On the same day, a proof of concept (PoC) was added to the Metasploit framework, enabling even low-skilled hackers to launch effective attacks against vulnerable servers.However, the exploitation had picked up the pace by then, and numerous threat actors had already started launching opportunistic attacks.Volexity reported yesterday that its analysts had identified approximately 1,600 ZCS servers that they believe were compromised by threat actors leveraging CVE-2022-41352 to plant webshells.In private conversations with cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, BleepingComputer was told that an unknown APT leveraging the critical flaw had likely pieced together a working exploit based on the information posted to the Zimbra forums.The first attacks started in September, targeting vulnerable Zimbra servers in India and some in Turkey. This initial wave of attacks was likely a testing wave against low-interest targets to evaluate the effectiveness of the attack.However, Kaspersky assessed that the threat actors compromised 44 servers during this initial wave.As soon as the vulnerability became public, the threat actors shifted gears and began to perform mass targeting, hoping to compromise as many servers worldwide as possible before admins patched the systems and shut the door to intruders.This second wave had a greater impact, infecting 832 servers with malicious webshells, although these attacks were more random than the previous attacks.ZCS admins who haven’t applied the available Zimbra security updates or the workarounds need to do so immediately, as exploitation activity is in high gear and will likely not stop for some time."

      "text": " Ransomware is when hackers take over a computer system, steal or lock up records and demand a payment to get those records back.  The attack usually begins when hackers gain access through a malicious link in an email.Kurt Baumgartner, a principal security researcher with Kaspersky, predicted a rise in these kinds of attacks this school year.Baumgartner said with so many young children now on computers, parents need to make sure their kids understand emails and what to open or not open.“They have to have some sort of interaction with children and guidance for kids about, you know, what’s happening with their passwords,” Baumgartner said.He said school districts also bear a huge responsibility and advised parents to advocate for better maintenance, updates, and security of the systems.Baumgartner shared two important tips for parents:Teaching best practices at an early age helps to protect your children, both at school and at home.Copyright 2022 Gray Media Group, Inc.

      "text": " A novel timing attack has emerged for targeting private corporate software packages hosted in the npm code repository. The goal is to uncover the legitimate offerings and then create malicious public packages using the same names in order to trick employees into downloading the doppelganger blocks.Code Dependency Confusion Rides AgainThe PoC demonstrated how outside code can be imported and propagated through a targeted company’s internal applications and systems, with relative ease — including at Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Shopify, Tesla, and Uber. Unsurprisingly, it didn't take long for malicious actors to replicate the attack pattern.One way to defend against these kinds of attacks is to keep the package names secret so they can't be cloned. But according to Aqua Security’s Nautilus research team, it's possible to reveal private packages names by using a glitch in npm's registry API.A New Type of Timing AttackNpm's registry API allows users to check for the existence of packages, download them, and receive information about them. If a user searches for a private package or one that doesn't exist, the website throws a 404 HTTP error message in both cases. However, there's a difference in the amount of time it takes to return that error page: The average response time to 404 a private package is 648 milliseconds, while the average time when a package doesn't exist at all is just 101 milliseconds.There are a few methods that could be used to create a list of private package names to test with the timing attack, according to the research.

      "text": " Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged inThe US federal government purchased more than 1,330 terminals from SpaceX to send to Ukraine at a cost of $3 millionThe agency initially said it was a “private sector donation valued at roughly $10 million,” but that figure has reportedly been removed from the release and now states that the US government “has delivered 5,000 Starlink Terminals” to Ukraine “through a public-private partnership” with SpaceX.The government agreed to purchase closer to 1,500 standard Starlink terminals for $1,500 apiece and pay $800,000 for transportation costs. This cost the US taxpayer over $3 million. Commercial Starlink terminals are priced at $600 per terminal, plus $110 per month for the internet service.A USAID spokesperson told the Post in a statement that the “delivery of Starlink terminals were made possible by a range of stakeholders, whose combined contributions valued over $15 million and facilitated the procurement, international flights, ground transportation, and satellite Internet service of 5,000 Starlink terminals.”SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment from the Washington Post or The Independent request for comment before time of publication.It is now unclear how many Starlink terminals in total have been donated by SpaceX, and how many are from foreign governments.Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesAFP via Getty ImagesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Virtual asset service providers are on notice that they must implement robust risk-based compliance programs and meet their BSA reporting requirements. FinCEN will not hesitate to act when it identifies willful violations of the BSA.”As previously shared, upon discovering the ransomware attack, we took immediate steps to protect our systems, contain the incident, begin an investigation, and ensure continuity of care. Our facilities are following existing protocols for system outages, which includes taking certain systems offline, such as electronic health records. In addition, we are taking steps to mitigate the disruption and maintain continuity of care. To further assist and support our team in the investigation and response process, we engaged leading cybersecurity specialists and notified law enforcement.We analyzed a QAKBOT-related case leading to a Brute Ratel C4 and Cobalt Strike payload that can be attributed to the threat actors behind the Black Basta ransomware.PCrisk found new STOP ransomware variants that append the .powz and .pohj extensions.A recent malicious campaign delivering Magniber ransomware has been targeting Windows home users with fake security updates.Microsoft says new Prestige ransomware is being used to target transportation and logistics organizations in Ukraine and Poland in ongoing attacks.The Dutch National Police, in collaboration with cybersecurity firm Responders.NU, obtained 155 decryption keys from the DeadBolt ransomware gang by faking ransom payments.In this report, we will provide our analysis of Ransom Cartel ransomware, as well as our assessment of the possible connections between REvil and Ransom Cartel ransomware."
