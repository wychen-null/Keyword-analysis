      "title": "Recycled Core Routers Expose Sensitive Corporate Network Info",
      "text": " Cameron Camp had purchased a Juniper SRX240H router last year on eBay, to use in a honeypot network he was building to study remote desktop protocol (RDP) exploits, and attacks on Microsoft Exchange and industrial control systems (ICS) devices. When the longtime security researcher at Eset booted up the secondhand Juniper router, to his surprise it displayed a hostname.After taking a closer look at the device, Camp contacted Tony Anscombe, Eset's chief security evangelist, to alert him to what he found on the router. \"This thing has a whole treasure trove of Silicon Valley A-list software company information on it,\" Camp recalls telling Anscombe.\"We got very, very concerned,\" Camp says.Camp and Anscombe decided to test their theory that this could be the tip of the iceberg for other decommissioned routers still harboring information from their previous owners' networks. They purchased several more decommissioned core routers — four Cisco Systems ASA 5500, three Fortinet FortiGate, and 11 Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateway routers.After dropping a few from the mix after one failed to power up and another two were actually mirrored routers from a former cluster, they found that nine of the remaining 16 held sensitive core networking configuration information, corporate credentials, and data on corporate applications, customers, vendors, and partners. The applications exposed on the routers were from big-name software vendors used in many enterprises: Microsoft Exchange, Lync/Skype, PeopleSoft, Salesforce, Microsoft SharePoint, Spiceworks, SQL, VMWare Horizon View, voice over IP apps, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) applications.The routers contained one or more set of IPSec or VPN credentials, or hashed root passwords, and each had sufficient data for the researchers to identify the actual previous owner/operator of the device. Nearly 90% included router-to-router authentication keys and details on applications connected to the networks, some 44% had network credentials to other networks (such as a supplier or partner), 33% included third-party connections to the network, and 22% harbored customer information.\"I have the entire network topology of their core infrastructure, both internal and external, like cloud assets,\" for example, Camp says.Camp says the discovery was a far cry from the malware he typically studies, and a lot less work for an attacker who happened upon one of these unwiped routers. \"I don't need a zero day, I have your router,\" quips Camp.\"They are the intersection upon everything that happens in your organization,\" Camp says of core routers. \"Everything touches the router,\" including many cloud services, he adds.Among the organizations whose information was exposed were a manufacturing company, a US law firm, managed services providers, an open source software firm, an events company, a telecommunications equipment supplier, a global data company, and a creative services company. Eset did not disclose the names of the organizations, but the researchers confirmed that they contacted all of them.The Silicon Valley software vendor was quick to respond, even awarding Camp a bug bounty that he then donated to the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the Tor Project. But that was the researchers' easiest disclosure.\"Once we stepped outside of the tech [sector], it was incredibly different\" and harder to disclose our findings, Anscombe notes. The other organizations didn't have processes or even people available to handle the disclosure information, he says.Meanwhile, one of the unwiped routers contained what Camp describes as a \"creepy\" remote administration interface.\"I was never sure if it was on purpose, but it was creepy, very low-level access, and from one of the countries with flags that we're [the US] not happy with right now,\" he says. \"It could be totally legit or that could be really bad. It was a little edgy to me.\"So how do you wipe a router that you want to retire? The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely decommission, and the big three — Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper — on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring devices to their factory default settings.With Juniper routers, for example, wiping the device is simple: \"Going to config setting and type 'delete,' hit 'Y' [to confirm] and now that router doesn't know who it is anymore,\" Camp says. The entire wiping process takes less than five minutes, including the post-deletion reboot.And if your organization already had disposed of routers that weren't properly wiped, Eset recommends rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted access to your network. Zero trust can help here as well, they say.But that's still no guarantee that a malicious actor who buys your old router still couldn't use it to target your organization. \"Even if somebody goes and changes the credentials of the accounts being cached in router, potentially [the attacker has] got the app lists, so [they] can tell what apps are run internally locally or in the cloud,\" Abscombe says.That gives the attacker just enough intel to plan a targeted attack, according to Abscombe. \"If I know they're running [a specific version of] Exchange and that version had a CVE and they had not applied the patch … I suddenly know things about their network that can make them vulnerable,\" he says. If you buy a secondhand core router, and, like the researchers, find that it still contains the previous owner's information, Eset recommends disconnecting the router and moving it to a secured area and contacting your regional CISA office. They also say it's best to document your purchase process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposes.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "NSO Group escalates spyware tactics with 3 new iPhone zero-click exploit chains | SC Media",
      "text": "  The notorious NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware continues to pose a threat, despite reports it was winding down its operations. New zero-click exploits found by watchdogs at Citizen Lab targeted two different remote attack surfaces on iPhones running iOS 15 and 16.PWNYOURHOME and FINDMYPWN are the first zero-click exploits to remotely and simultaneously target two Apple attack surfaces, according to Citizen Lab researchers. The use of zero-click exploits against iOS is not new, as past research showed similar tactics against iOS 14 devices with the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. The latest Citizen Lab research found three more zero-click exploits tied to the NSO Group being used to hack iOS 15 and iOS 16 devices. The tactics were discovered during their long-running investigation into NSO’s campaign against several Mexican human rights groups. Network defenders should take note that these new tactics demonstrate that NSO Group is escalating its attempts to stop researchers from analyzing their tactics by blocking all traces of infection. Even when they’re not successful, the group is certainly undermining these efforts.The first, PWNYOURHOME, is an iOS exploit that could enable an attacker to infiltrate the iMessage app to modify the HomeKit software. The issue was disclosed to Apple, which later fixed the vulnerability in the iOS 16.3.1 update.The attack is deployed in two phases, with each targeting a different iOS process. The first phase uses a daemon crash in the HomeKit app, then moves to download PNG images from the iMessage app, causing BlastDoor to crash. Citizen Lab could not determine how the exploit leaves BlastDoor, but they found the exploit later launches Pegasus through the iOS component called “mediaserverd.”Fortunately, it appears use of Apple’s Lockdown Mode feature can successfully block PWNYOURHOME attacks levied by the notorious spyware vendor, as the function alerted users to the attempted attack visible through the notification display.However, there are no indications NSO has stopped using the exploit, suggesting the group “may have figured out a way to correct the notification issue, such as by fingerprinting Lockdown Mode.”The second exploit, FINDMYPWN, effectively targets the fmfd process on the ‘Find My’ function of iOS 15.5 and iOS 15.6 devices. The exploit enables items to be written and deleted inside of the cache directory. Citizen Lab is limiting the forensic information it releases for the exploit, so as not to inform the NSO Group of possible evasion tactics.A final exploit was observed after the researchers reassessed earlier forensics. LATENTIMAGE first appeared in January 2022 impacting iOS 15 devices. Evidence suggests the exploit also uses the ‘Find My’ function, but it’s initial access point is not confirmed.For Citizen Lab, “the use of multiple attack surfaces should encourage developers to think holistically about device security, and treat the entire surface reachable through a single identifier as a single surface.”What’s more, “modern exploit mitigations like pointer authentication codes significantly reduce attacker freedom to execute arbitrary code on a device,” researchers wrote. But PWNYOURHOME shows that “real-world attackers can, and do, find practical ways around these mitigations, such as by repurposing signed pointers located at known offsets in the iOS shared cache.”As the NSO group continues these evasive tactics, Citizen Lab stressed that it’s “encouraging” that Lockdown Mode successfully notified targets of ongoing attacks. While no tool is a cure-all, the feature could go far in dampening the impact of similar attack methods.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.GitHub has updated its Advanced Security platform available for Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server customers to provide new artificial intelligence-powered features in a bid to \"revolutionize\" secure app development, reports SecurityWeek.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Aug 27 - Wed Aug 28Tue Dec 5On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Using Telegram as its command-and-control (C2) mechanism, a new strain of malware, a bot dubbed Zaraza, is capable of extracting login credentials from a victim's open browser and saving them to a file, as well as taking screenshots of open windows to be saved in a JPG file.The type of login credentials that it steals range from bank accounts to email accounts to online wallets, as well as other sensitive and valuable website targets. This information can provide attackers with the opportunity to commit severe crimes such as identity theft and financial fraud, as well as grant access to personal identifiable information (PII) and, especially in the era of remote work, business accounts. This variant of malware and what it allows attackers to do potentially opens the floodgates to financial loss and \"reputational damage,\" according to the analysis.\"To protect yourself against this malware,\" the Uptycs researchers wrote, \"you should update your passwords regularly, follow online security best practices such as using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and ensure regular software and security system updates.\" Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "QBot Expands Initial Access Malware Strategy With PDF-WSF Combo",
      "text": " A recent surge in QBot Trojan attacks has been observed, spreading via malicious emails written in various languages, including English, German, Italian, and French. The emails are crafted using genuine business letters obtained by the attackers and urge the recipient to open an attached PDF file, which contains several layers of obfuscation that make its maliciousness less detectable by security tools.According to an analysis by Kaspersky this week, the campaign also uses the method of using reply-chain emails to make it more difficult for soon-to-be-victims to flag as malicious. As the name suggests, reply chain is the practice of accessing existing email exchanges from a listserv (or any location) and replying to them, making the interloping messages look legit, less suspicious, and believable.The campaign represents a change in tactics for the operators of QBot (aka QakBot or Pinkslipbot), who maintain an access-as-a-service offering that other cybercriminals use to deliver a range of second-stage malware to already-compromised targets. Initially discovered in 2007, QBot has undergone numerous modifications and enhancements over the years, resulting in its widespread distribution as one of the most actively propagated malware strains in 2020. These latest improvements help boost stealth and legitimacy, according to security researchers. For instance, the emails are crafted to change only minimal parts of the stolen documents; they may contain links or attachments that contain links to malicious sites.\"The WSF is obfuscated to evade detection which will download further payloads,\" explains Timothy Morris, chief security adviser at Tanium. \"The attack 'chaining', or using multiple steps, helps get past some protections since the full context of the nefarious behavior can't be observed as a single activity.\"Morris notes that the multiple phases in the attack flow, from the initial emails to payloads being downloaded to data exfiltration and theft requires a range of cybersecurity strategies to defend against.\"It is important to have a defense-in-depth strategy that includes detection, monitoring, and protection technologies at the endpoint, as well as Web, network, and email security that is up to date,\" he says. \"Also, training users to these types of threats is important.\"Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at Keeper Security, says potential targets should also be trained to recognize that, unlike phishing attempts that appear to come from random businesses or the government, the malicious file containing malware will appear to come from someone you've had past email conversations with.\"The threat actors hope to piggyback on your relationship and level of trust to get these contacts to download the files,\" he explains. \"Employees should avoid making risky clicks. Suspicious links should not be clicked and untrusted software should not be installed.\"Other email security best practices include verifying the email sender and content before downloading attachments, and hovering over embedded links to see the actual target URL. Also, defenders also should focus on making sure antivirus and anti-malware solutions are deployed and up to date, and secure endpoints, including PCs, servers, routers, and so on, keeping them patched.Guccione says the latest resurgence of QBot, along with new modules and evasion techniques being added, indicates active development of the malware, so companies should be vigilant when it comes to being prepared for the latest changes.\"It’s still a very capable adversary tool that defenders need to protect against,\" Guccione explains.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Ransomware for Mac may raise alarm bells, though a closer examination of the binary reveals that it's not quite ready for prime time.However, he adds, \"I think this should be looked at as a harbinger of things to come. You have a very well funded and motivated, large ransomware group that's saying: 'Hey, we're setting our sights on on macOS.'\"Will Mac users be ready when ransomware finally comes for them?Saturday's discovery may be best characterized as Windows malware with macOS lipstick.In unpacking the code, Wardle discovered multiple strings related to Windows artifacts — like autorun.inf, ntuser.dat.log, and so on. The lone component indicating its OS intentions was a variable called \"apple_config.\"\"This is the only instance (I found) of any macOS specific references/customizations,\" Wardle noted in the analysis, appending that \"(The rest of the malware's binary simply looks like Linux code, compiled for macOS).\"There were other signs, too, that the developers hadn't yet completed their project. For example, the code was signed \"ad-hoc\" — a stand-in for, say, a stolen Apple Developer ID. This could be a placeholder for future RaaS customers, but for now, Wardle explains, \"this means if downloaded to a macOS system (i.e. deployed by the attackers) macOS won't let it run.\"Suffice it to say: LockBit hasn't breached the Apple dam just yet. But that doesn't mean Mac users can relax.\"Look at, traditionally, who the targets are for large ransomware attacks. It's the enterprises: hospitals, packaging facilities, these more traditional companies,\" Wardle points out. \"They are generally Windows-based.\"\"The pandemic and the work from home really spurred that,\" Wardle postulates. \"A lot of people have Mac computers. And as the younger generation enters the workforce — they are more comfortable with the Apple ecosystem.\"Following from that, he adds, \"hackers who are very opportunistic are realizing that a lot of their potential victims are now transitioning, and thus they need to evolve their malicious creations.\"So the question may not be whether ransomware groups will jump into macOS, but how soon. \"This,\" Wardle thinks, \"is really the million-dollar question.\"Luckily for Mac users, Apple has anticipated this ransomware D-Day, and has proactively gotten ahead of it. Wardle points to two primary defenses already built into the operating system.Firstly, he says, \"system files are under read-only conditions. So even if ransomware gets root access on a computer, it's still not going to be able to modify those critical files and lock or render the system inoperable.\"Second is TCC — short for Transparency, Consent, and Control.\"The idea is that certain directories — for example, the user's document directory, desktop, downloads, their browser folders, and cookies — are actually protected by the operating system,\" Wardle explains. If ransomware finds its way onto the system, \"it's going to run into TCC and it's not going to be able to access the files it wants to encrypt, without either another exploit or getting the user to explicitly approve the access.\"There's a caveat to that happy news though. \"Apple has done a great job implementing security mechanisms, but,\" Wardle warns, \"these features haven't been really tried and tested yet. Maybe hackers will start poking and find some flaws. TCC, for example, has been riddled with bypasses basically since day one.\"\"It would be naive to think that the attackers aren't going to improve their techniques and create more effective ransomware,\" he concludes. \"So, I think it's really great to be talking about this now.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It enables the email to have a malicious attachment and leverages email spoofing techniques to make it appear from a legitimate source.Observed adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), victimology, and infrastructure found in the SMTP server configuration overlap with previously identified Gamaredon activity.Gamaredon APT group is believed to be a Russian State-backed threat group linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB). Gamaredon is known for its cyberespionage activities, primarily targeting Ukrainian government entities. The group uses spear phishing emails and social engineering lures as a primary tactic.The threat actor used a generic web panel to craft and send phishing emails against Ukrainian government entities. This allowed the actor to automate the malware delivery process against specific targets entered by the attackers in the email recipient section of the panel's user interface.  Pivoted IP addresses overlap with previously reported Gamaredon activity (8).  EclecticIQ analysts discovered a publicly facing SMTP server 194[.]180[.]191[.]56 used in a spear phishing campaign against Ukrainian government entities in February 2023. The exposed SMTP server hosts a web panel for crafting and delivering spear phishing emails. Analysts assess with high confidence that the threat actor used this infrastructure to send large number of spear phishing emails automatically. Figure 1 shows two example phishing emails sent from the server:  Figure 1 - Example of phishing emails with malicious attachment sent in in February 2023.EclecticIQ analysts identified these two different spear-phishing emails sent from 194[.]180[.]191[.]56. Both of these emails contain a RAR archive file as an attachment, which are used to deliver the initial malware. Figures 2 and 3 showed two different malware execution flows, sent on Wed, 15 Feb 2023 17:10:18 +0200 and Wed, 08 Feb 2023 17:15:44 which are identical to previous Gamaredon campaigns (1).Figure 2 - Spear phishing email sent on Wednesday, 15 February 2023.Figure 3 - Spear phishing email sent it on Wednesday, 8 February 2023.Figure 4 shows the origin of the phishing email and spoofed email address:  Figure 4 - Source of phishing email.The server had port 80 open for use by the threat actor for crafting spear phishing emails via a simple user interface seen in figure 5.  Figure 5 - Web panel translated from Russian to English.The web panel allowed the threat actor to send emails using the hardcoded sender address pivn-kr@prokuratura[.]dp[.]ua. EclecticIQ analysts identified the same email address in a recent phishing email campaign sent to a Ukrainian military address on February 9, 2023 (5), indicating that the exposed panel was very likely used for malware delivery.EclecticIQ analysts identified that the “.htaccess” file on the exposed SMTP server was misconfigured. The ”.htaccess” file is a directory-level configuration to limit access to a web server from trusted IP addresses only. According to the Apache documentation, users must insert all IP filters inside the \"<RequireAll>\" tag (7). However, this tag was missing in the configuration used by threat actor.Analysts identified five IP addresses in the “.htaccess” file (figure 6):Figure 6 – Reconnaissance with gobuster (6) and pivoting.  The majority of the pivoted IP addresses are located in Moscow, Russia from the same server provider, Crelcom LLC (AS 6789). WHOIS records show that one of the IP addresses - 109[.]200[.]159[.]46 - was registered under the name Michael Tishin. The same name is also listed as registrant for another IP - 109[.]200[.]159[.]54. This IP was attributed to Gamaredon by BlackBerry on January 19, 2023 (8).The adversary TTPs and victimology overlap with Gamaredon activity previously reported by EclecticIQ and other researchers starting in 2020 (1).EclecticIQ analysts identified one IP address 109[.]200[.]159[.]59 in the “.htaccess” file that links to a spear phishing email submitted to VirusTotal on November 20, 2020. In May 2022, Cisco reported the campaign and attributed the activity to Gamaredon (2, 4).Figure 7 shows the connection between the pivoted IP addresses and malicious files uploaded to VirusTotal. The IP address links to a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment. The attachments exploit CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office remote code execution vulnerability in Windows.Figure 7 – Link analysis for 109[.]200[.]159[.]59.Figure 8 shows that spear phishing email was sent to the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) on November 19, 2020. It contained a malicious Word document attachment used for malware delivery. The email sender section was spoofed by threat actors to make the email look legitimate.Figure 8 – Content of the phishing email.Figure 9 displays the metadata of the spear phishing email. The \"X-Sender-IP\" field in the metadata reveals the IP address 109[.]200[.]159[.]59 of the sender. This IP address does not match the domain name (i.ua) in the “From” field, proving it is a spoofed email.Figure 9 – Metadata section inside phishing email.Once a victim opens the delivered malicious Word document, it will exploit CVE-2017-0199. If the exploitation is successful, then it will download a second-stage malware from the domain  erythrocephala[.]online, which has been attributed to Gamaredon.EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that Russian government-linked APTs will continue to use social engineering tactics during cyberattacks against Ukraine. Additionally, they are expected to increasingly target NATO partners due to NATO's support of Ukraine during the Russian war.It is very likely that the threat actor will modify their TTPs to avoid detection that will increase their chances of success, especially during the malware delivery stage."

      "title": "Cyber Espionage in India: Decoding APT-36's New Linux Malware Campaign",
      "text": " KuppingerCole positions Uptycs a CSPM Technology LeaderKuppingerCole positions Uptycs a CSPM Technology LeaderThe Uptycs threat research team has discovered a new Linux malware, Poseidon, deployed by the APT-36 group, also known as Transparent Tribe. This Pakistan-based advanced persistent threat group is notorious for targeting Indian government organizations, military personnel, and defense contractors. Transparent Tribe used the Kavach authentication tool as a cover to deliver the Poseidon payload. Kavach is a two-factor authentication (2FA) solution provided by the Indian government for secure access to their email services. Transparent Tribe created a backdoored version of Kavach to target Linux users working for Indian government agencies. When a user interacts with the malicious version of Kavach, the genuine login page is displayed to distract them. Meanwhile, the payload is downloaded in the background, compromising the user's system. Poseidon is a second-stage payload malware associated with Transparent Tribe. It is a general-purpose backdoor that provides attackers with a wide range of capabilities to hijack an infected host. Its functionalities include logging keystrokes, taking screen captures, uploading and downloading files, and remotely administering the system in various ways. Primarily, Poseidon is distributed through malicious websites disguised as legitimate Indian government sites. Uptycs research found that the malware infrastructure, such as malicious domains, is linked to earlier APT-36 campaigns. This highlights the group's continued focus on the aforementioned Indian targets. Repercussions of this APT-36 attack could be significant, leading to loss of sensitive information, compromised systems, financial losses, and reputational damage. Moreover, as the Transparent Tribe is thought to be state-sponsored, its activities could escalate tensions between nations, potentially resulting in retaliatory cyberattacks. This highlights the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures and remaining vigilant against the ever-evolving threat landscape. APT-36, aka Transparent Tribe, primarily targets Indian government organizations, military personnel, and defense contractors. Its objective is usually to gather sensitive information, conduct cyber espionage, and compromise the security of its targets.APT-36 is known to have exploited various platforms, including Windows and Android. The bad actors often create fake websites and documents that mimic legitimate government entities or organizations. This can trick targeted users into revealing their credentials or downloading malware onto their systems. It has also used custom-developed malware such as the Crimson RAT (remote access trojan) for cyber espionage.Users can protect themselves by following these best practices: The Uptycs threat research team has uncovered an ELF malware sample (MD5: c82bf2c50900b89b66e9f62d68c415ab). It’s a compiled Python executable (Pyinstaller) of nearly 5 MB in size.Upon extraction, a possible entry point is at Kavach.pyc (Fig. 1). Next we’ll decompile it to produce its source code.Fig. 1 – Extraction of .pyc files from pyinstaller executable Seen in the Fig. 2 Python code, the ELF file distracts the user by opening the legitimate Kavach login page (Fig. 3). This is where 2FA is provided to Indian users wanting to access their government email service. But in the background, a malicious “bosshelp” file is downloaded from hxxps://sharing1[.]filesharetalk.com/bosshelp to the user’s ~/.local/share directory.Fig. 2 – Decompiled Python code This creates a crontab to periodically log the victim's machine “loginname” in /dev/shm/mycron.Fig. 3 – Legitimate Kavach login page to trick users Let's now examine the “bosshelp” second stage payload. “Checkin” keywordProcess nameOSPIDIP AddressHostnameUUID“Amd64aring” keyword(The integrity level is 3 if the process is elevated; otherwise it’s level 2.) Fig. 4 – C2 check-in The C2 was offline during our analysis. But the binary contained a switch case (Fig. 5) having a number of tasks (e.g., keylogging, injecting, screen capture, uploading/downloading files). Each task is associated with a TaskID shown in the following table.Fig. 5 – Switch case to perform various tasks COMMAND CODE (DECIMAL)TASKDESCRIPTION4ShellExecute shell commands5Screencapture_runTake a screenshot of victim’s desktop6Keylog_RunLogging keystrokes7DownloadDownload file from remote system8UploadUpload file to remote machine9LibInjectInject a library10Ps_runList processes running on machine11Sleep_runSleep time12cat_runRead contents inside the file13cd_runChange directory14lsList contents inside the directory15jxa_runJavascript for automation16keys_runRetrieve keys from Kerberos keychain17triagedirectorySearch target directory18sshauthAuthenticate to host using username and password pair19portscanScan target for open ports20main.getJoblistingGet list of current running jobs21main.killJobKill a process with given PID22cp_runCopy a file23drives_runList currently mounted drives along with their description24getuser_runList information about current user25mkdirCreate directory.26mvMove a file27pwdPrint working directory28rmDelete a file29getenvRetrieve current environment variables30setenvSet environment variables31unsetenvDelete environment variable32kill_runKill process with given PID33curl_runExecute curl command34xpc_runCross-process communication35socksSupport for SOCKS proxies36listtask_runGet list of running tasks37list_entitlements_RunList entitlements (permissions associated with a particular PID)38Execute_memoryExecute shellcode directly from the memory39jsimport_runTo load specified javascript module43dyld_inject_RunInject dynamic library This payload serves as an all-purpose backdoor.

It has previously executed many payloads in Windows and Android. Now APT 36 has started targeting Linux users, too. Sites such as Kavach, Rodra, and KSB were used in social engineering attacks to trick targeted users. Users should be extremely careful and double-check URLs before opening or downloading files. We could see new features/advancements from this APT group in the future. The Uptycs threat research team continuously monitors related malware campaigns to safeguard our clients and inform the broader security community. In addition to having YARA built-in and being armed with other advanced detection capabilities, Uptycs XDR users can easily scan for Poseidon. XDR contextual detection provides important details about identified malware. Users can navigate to the toolkit data section in the detection alert, then click a detected item to reveal its profile (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 – Uptycs EDR detection   File NameMD5Kavachc82bf2c50900b89b66e9f62d68c415abconfirmationId_ksb382285738bae358060011ad847e845d2confirmationId_rodra02796a813b79928c95b2475798a14688Bosshelpaeb3ad3426794d4e90de4d139e92ee4dBossstart21316422f8c7f0f3ab2b9a282cdacd03Bosstype7b163e400e481519d74e06c1116a5200Kavachelf9b64528352dd683e55eb308919a596fa sharing1[.]filesharetalk.com/bosshelpksboard[.]inrodra[.]intt1[.]apktrial[.]com70[.]34[.]214[.]252Get regular updates on all things Uptycs—from product updates to expert articles and much more"

      "text": "  A screen image of the ransom by the LockBit ransomware group. (Image provided by Recorded Future)LockBit, known for the effective evolution of its tactics, has again modified its variant. In one instance, the ransomware strain was seen targeting Mac devices — the first of its kind for a major ransomware operation.However, Wardle was quick to point out that while the fresh LockBit sample can indeed run on Apple products, “it’s basically the extent of its impact.” As noted, “The codesign utility shows that though it’s signed, it’s signed 'ad-hoc' (say vs. an Apple Developer ID).”“This means if downloaded to a macOS system, i.e. deployed by the attackers, macOS won’t let it run,” Wardle explained. “This is confirmed by the spctl utility which shows ‘invalid signature.’” The sample also suggests that it was initially designed to run on Windows. In fact, several sample strings contained nothing that specifically related to MacOS, which may mean the “code is simply a recompile of LockBit ransomware that targets Windows, Linux, and also VMWare ESXi.So while it’s notable that a LockBit sample has been found targeting MacOS, it’s unlikely the current variant will impact the average user, Wardle stressed. What’s important is to maintain ongoing conversations about detection and prevention of these kinds of threats.In another fresh campaign, the ransomware appears to rely on the source code of Conti, another highly effective variant. After Conti was disbanded in May 2021, an affiliate leaked the source code of the group that enabled other cybercrime groups to recover the code for future use.TrickBot was previously employed by the Conti group, which reaffirms the connection. But the BazaLoader tie “is a little more subtle.” Like Lockbit, the group has also been observed using the leaked Conti code.Glimps was also able to examine LockBit’s payment portal and the group’s ransom note, which found evidence of multiple fresh LockBit variants. The ransom note structure bore similarities to previous variants, while the newly detected strains rely on a string of random characters instead of the .lockbit extension.“The different results produced by the analyzes… confirm what we initially thought: We are indeed faced with variants of Lockbit that shamelessly rely on Conti code, the Lockbit Green version,” researchers wrote.Most recently, data showed LockBit was leveraging a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model to continue its previous campaigns, which have effectively hindered traditional computer network defenses and mitigation.Known as LockBit Black, the variant was “more modular and evasive” than previous versions. Much like the Glimps’ findings, LockBit Black shares similarities with Black Matter and Black Cat ransomware.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " Ex-Conti ransomware members have teamed up with the FIN7 threat actors to distribute a new malware family named 'Domino' in attacks on corporate networks.Domino is a relatively new malware family consisting of two components, a backdoor named 'Domino Backdoor,' which in turn drops a 'Domino Loader' that injects an info-stealing malware DLL into the memory of another process.IBM's Security Intelligence researchers have been tracking ex-Conti and TrickBot members utilizing the new malware in attacks since February 2023.It should be noted that this new malware is unrelated to the HCL Domino (formerly IBM Domino) product.Since the fall of 2022, IBM researchers have been tracking attacks using a malware loader named 'Dave Loader' that is linked to former Conti ransomware and TrickBot members.However, more recently, IBM says they have seen Dave Loader installing the new Domino malware family.Most commonly, Dave Loader would drop 'Domino Backdoor,' which would then install 'Domino Loader.'Domino Backdoor is a 64-bit DLL that will enumerate system information, such as running processes, usernames, computer names, and send it back to the attacker's Command and Control server. The backdoor also receives commands to execute or further payloads to install.The backdoor was seen downloading an additional loader, Domino Loader, that installs an embedded .NET info-stealer called 'Nemesis Project.' It can also plant a Cobalt Strike beacon, for greater persistence.\"The Domino Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-joined systems, suggesting a more capable backdoor, such as Cobalt Strike, will be downloaded on higher value targets instead of Project Nemesis,\" explains the IBM researchers Charlotte Hammond and Ole Villadsen.Project Nemesis is a standard information-stealing malware that can collect credentials stored in browsers and applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser history.Threat actors, especially those who utilize ransomware, commonly partner with other threat groups to distribute malware and for initial access to corporate networks.Over time, the lines between the malware developers and the ransomware gangs have grown murky, making distinguishing between the two operations hard.IBM has attributed the Domino malware family to FIN7 due to a great deal of code overlap with Lizar (aka Tirion and DiceLoader), a post-exploitation toolkit associated with FIN7.Furthermore, IBM found that a loader named 'NewWorldOrder,' normally used in FIN7's Carbanak attacks, was recently used to push the Domino malware.So, in a confusing joint venture, we have Dave Loader (TrickBot/Conti) pushing the Domino (FIN7) malware, which in turn deploys Project Nemesis or Cobalt Strike beacons believed to be associated with ex-Conti member ransomware activity.This means that defenders have to deal with a confusing web of threat actors, all with malware allowing remote access to networks."

      "text": " Payment processing giant NCR disclosed a ransomware attack this weekend that caused an outage on its point of sale technology used widely by restaurants.The company told Recorded Future News that it discovered the ransomware attack on April 13, when a data center outage impacted some of their customers.The incident affected the company’s Aloha service – which provides restaurants with a system to manage point of sale hardware, online orders, marketing tools and more. NCR says the service is used by thousands of restaurants around the world.“Upon such determination, NCR immediately started contacting customers, enacted its cybersecurity protocol and engaged outside experts to contain the incident and begin the recovery process. The investigation into the incident includes NCR experts, external forensic cybersecurity experts and federal law enforcement,” a spokesperson said.“We believe this incident is limited to specific functionality in Aloha cloud-based services and Counterpoint. At this time, our ongoing investigation also indicates that no customer systems or networks are involved. None of our ATM, digital banking, payments, or other retail products are processed at this data center.”The spokesperson confirmed that the ransomware attack has impacted the ability of several restaurants to manage administrative functions. The company is now working on creating alternatives for those customers and restoring the impacted tools.On April 15, cybersecurity expert Dominic Alvieri said the BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group took credit for the attack, posting the company on its leak site.The group shared alleged messages between NCR representatives and BlackCat hackers, claiming that while no data was stolen during the attack, they were able to steal credentials that customers use to access their systems.NCR reported a revenue of more than $7 billion in 2021 through the sale of self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, and barcode scanners.The company, initially known as National Cash Register, was created in 1879 to sell the first mechanical cash register.Bugcrowd CEO Dave Gerry said point of sale systems remain an attractive target for hackers “given the business criticality of both the customer payment data and broader impact to business operations.”“This is a timely example reinforcing that cyberattacks impact more than just the primary target – in this case potentially thousands of small businesses that rely on the NCR Aloha POS Platform,” he said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  A simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) abuse tool dubbed Legion can scan Shodan to identify misconfigured cloud servers and then take over SMTP email marketing programs or launch phishing campaigns.Legion can also send SMS text messages to launch mobile-based phishing and disinformation campaigns and has targeted 14 different telecoms, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. It can also bundle additional functionality traditionally found in more common hacking tools, such as the ability to execute web server specific exploit code and brute force account credentials. Matt Muir, a threat intelligence researcher at Cado, said security administrators can neutralize Legion by making sure their environment files are not exposed to the public internet. “Environment files are text files used to store credentials,” explained Muir. “By securing the environment files there’s not much Legion can do. Admins have to make sure that the environment files are not located in a directory that’s exposed to the internet.”Muir said Cado researchers consider Legion an emerging generation of cloud-focused credential harvester/spam utilities. Developers of these tools often steal each other's code, making attribution to a particular group difficult.“Mail and SMS abuse are big business for attackers,” wrote Ahl. “We have come across close to a dozen variants of similar scripts that are being sold regularly for nefarious purposes. Legion is not the first nor will it be the last.”The Telegram groups used to distribute Legion have a combined membership of about 5,000. Muir said although we can assume not everybody in these groups will purchase a license for the software, it’s clear that there’s now considerable demand for such a tool.“If even half of the members purchased a license and used the SMTP abuse capabilities for spam or phishing purposes, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that tens of thousands of users would be affected,” said Muir, who also footnoted that at the time the blog was written, Cado researchers had seen zero detections on VirusTotal.“Attackers often look to get access to an API using credentials or tokens obtained through nefarious means,” said Rago. “Once they gain the valid privileged credential or token, the attacker can leverage the API to exfiltrate data or compromise a service.”Davis McCarthy, principal security researcher at Valtix, added that Legion automates real world tactics, techniques and procedures at scale, reducing the threat actors time to initial access. McCarthy explained that if the hacker can’t exploit the target organization’s infrastructure remotely, then there are options to brute-force AWS credentials and set up phishing campaigns with Amazon SES.“The AWS module also tags newly created malicious users, working as a defense evasion technique and establishing legitimacy,” said McCarthy. “Even target reconnaissance is made easy by integrating with Shodan.”U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Transitioning to cloud-native environments has brought along security risks for companies, according to TechRadar.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Apr 23Wed Dec 6On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " The Chinese state-sponsored hacking group APT41 was found abusing the GC2 (Google Command and Control) red teaming tool in data theft attacks against a Taiwanese media and an Italian job search company.In Google's April 2023 Threat Horizons Report, released last Friday, security researchers in its Threat Analysis Group (TAG) revealed that APT41 was abusing the GC2 red teaming tool in attacks.GC2, also known as Google Command and Control, is an open-source project written in Go that was designed for red teaming activities.\"Furthermore, the program will interact only with Google's domains (*.google.com) to make detection more difficult.\"The project consists of an agent that is deployed on compromised devices, which then connects back to a Google Sheets URL to receive commands to execute.These commands cause the deployed agents to download and install additional payloads from Google Drive or exfiltrate stolen data to the cloud storage service.According to Google's report, TAG disrupted an APT41 phishing attack against a Taiwanese media company that attempted to distribute the GC2 agent through phishing emails.\"The payload was an open source red teaming tool called \"Google Command and Control\" (GC2).\"Google says that APT41 also used GC2 in attacks against an Italian job search website in July 2022.Using the agent, Google says that the threat actors attempted to deploy additional payloads on the device and exfiltrate data to Google Drive, as illustrated in the attack workflow below.While it is not known what malware was distributed in these attacks, APT41 is known to deploy a wide variety of malware on compromised systems.The threat actors have also been known to deploy the Winnti malware and the China Chopper web shell, tools commonly used by Chinese hacking groups, and Cobalt Strike for persistence in compromised networks.BleepingComputer contacted Google to learn more about the payloads they saw in these attacks, but a response was not immediately available.APT41's use of GC2 is another indicator of a trend of threat actors moving to legitimate red teaming tools and RMM platforms as part of their attacks.Unfortunately, as with any tool that can help red teamers conduct exercises or for admins to manage a network remotely, they can equally be abused by threat actors in their own attacks."

      "text": " A new QBot malware campaign is leveraging hijacked business correspondence to trick unsuspecting victims into installing the malware, new findings from Kaspersky reveal.The latest activity, which commenced on April 4, 2023, has primarily targeted users in Germany, Argentina, Italy, Algeria, Spain, the U.S., Russia, France, the U.K., and Morocco.The goal is to entice victims into opening malicious links or malicious attachments, in this case, an enclosed PDF file that masquerades as a Microsoft Office 365 or Microsoft Azure alert.Opening the document leads to the retrieval of an archive file from an infected website that, in turn, contains an obfuscated Windows Script File (.WSF). The script, for its part, incorporates a PowerShell script that downloads malicious DLL from a remote server. The downloaded DLL is the QBot malware.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "title": "DoNot APT Targets Individuals in South Asia using Android Malware - CYFIRMA",
      "text": " Recently CYFIRMA observed a cyber-attack on an individual residing in Kashmir, India. CYFIRMA research team collected two pieces of malware from the download folder of the victim’s mobile. Analysis of the samples links this attack with DoNot APT, historically very active in the region.The collected malware in the download folder of the victim’s mobile implicates that the threat actor used third-party file-sharing websites, leading to files being downloaded and saved in the main download folder on the mobile device. There is also a plausibility that the threat actor has developed their own file-sharing online platform as a delivery mechanism. The malware samples were decoyed as chatting apps with the name “Ten Messenger.apk” and “Link Chat QQ.apk”. Based on the naming conventions of the collected samples, there is an impression that they are either related to chat applications or may potentially be chat applications. However, after analyzing both samples, the team found the apps to be total dummies, it doesn’t even work properly to keep victims engaged with the app for the purpose of chatting. After further analysis, it was found that both samples are highly obfuscated, and codes are scattered to make the analyses difficult. The app is similar to other malicious apps used in previous campaigns, which are more than one year old. The malicious app leverages Google’s firebase for a command-and-control server.Our analysis of the obtained samples revealed the presence of encrypted strings. Specifically, in the Android samples from the previous campaign, the strings were encrypted using a layer of the Base64 algorithm. However, in the current sample, the team analyzed, we found that the strings were encrypted with two layers of encryption – Base64 and AES256, with CBC mode and PKCS padding. The code was obfuscated and protected using Pro Guard, making it difficult to understand. Overall, our technical analysis points to the DoNot APT as the perpetrator of this attack, which is consistent with their past targeting of entities in the Kashmir region of India.The threat actor is active since 2016 and has been carrying out cyber strikes in the South Asian region. There are some media articles reporting that the threat actor belongs to the Indian soil, but we cannot confidently confirm if they belong to India, or what interest they are currently serving. In the past, the threat actor has also targeted their adversary with spear phishing attacks from different target industries and regions. The threat actor is known for their consistent attacks and the same was reflected, when we observed two different apps in the victim’s mobile with different command and control servers, belonging to DoNot APT.The attack is not surprising to the threat intelligence community, as DoNot has previously targeted NGOs and other entities in the Kashmir area, as well as other regions of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan on multiple occasions. The aim behind the attack is still unknown; however, with a medium level of confidence, we can say that the threat actor could have employed a spear messaging attack. The threat actor could have used WhatsApp or other chatting messengers for the initial stage of the social engineering attack to deliver the app. Because apps were found in the download folder, and it is only possible when delivered by a third-party file-sharing site. Attaching the app directly to WhatsApp increases the chances of malicious apps getting detected, but sending the app as a file attachment saves the file in the WhatsApp media location and not in the download folder, which is the same with other chatting messengers.Upon Installing, the Android Malware Sample asks the victim to open the app.After opening the App, it asks the victim to enable the accessibility service, shown below in the screenshot. It shows the victim the same alert every time the app is opened, until the victim enables it.After Clicking on “Ok”, the app takes the victim to the accessibility setting page, where it asks the victim to enable Accessibility, by clicking on “Link Chat” and turning the accessibility service on. Also, upon turning the accessibility on, the app hides from the main menu and it restricts the victim from uninstalling the app to an extent.Below is a snippet from the Android Manifest file, the malicious app tries to access most of the permissions to perform malicious tasks.Below are a few dangerous permissions described that malicious Android app accesses:Below is a screenshot of the files, after decompiling the Android package, using Bytecode Viewer. The snippet shows scattered modules as part of obfuscation.The extract below is the code that interacts with the command-and-control server. The command-and-control domain was encrypted with Base64 and AES256, with CBC mode and PKCS padding. The decryption of the string revealed playstoree[.]xyz domain. The suspected IOC is a year old and belongs to the notorious Do Not APT.The snippet below is of the module, where a class is used for encryption and decryption of the string, using a secret key.The below Snippet shows a module that is exploiting “android.intent.action.NEW_OUTGOING_CALL” and “android.intent.extra.PHONE_NUMBER” permission to monitor outgoing and incoming calls of the compromised victims.The extract below shows that the module is storing call logs with a few other details, such as time and duration in JSON Array and is ready to send it over to the command- and-control server.The snippet below shows the module where it fetches GPS location, if it’s turned on in the victim’s phone.The screenshot below shows the module where Names and Numbers are extracted into Contacts.txt and sent over to the command-and-control server.The threat actor is constantly targeting individuals in the Kashmir region of India. Their attack is not so sophisticated and the aim behind the attack is still unknown. While compiling this report, we have come across another sample that has a different name, but the code used in this sample is similar to that of the previous samples analysed, except for the command-and-control domain. This domain is new and has not been flagged as a malicious IOC anywhere. Also, our analysis of almost two-year- old APKs has revealed that the string was encrypted only with Base64 algorithms, whereas, the samples obtained one year ago revealed that the string was encrypted using two layers of encryption, including Base64 and AES256 with CBC mode and PKCS padding. This indicates that the threat actor has been utilizing the same tactics and techniques for the past two years. It is expected that the group will utilize similar and consistent tactics and techniques, especially in the context of spear phishing via messaging, to target their intended victims.Indicators of CompromiseMITRE ATT&CK Technique DetectionCopyright CYFIRMA.
