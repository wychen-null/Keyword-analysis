      "text": " The Emotet malware operation is again spamming malicious emails as of Tuesday morning after a three-month break, rebuilding its network and infecting devices worldwide.Emotet is a notorious malware distributed through email containing malicious Microsoft Word and Excel document attachments. When users open these documents and macros are enabled, the Emotet DLL will be downloaded and loaded into memory.Once Emotet is loaded, the malware will sit quietly, waiting for instructions from a remote command and control server.While Emotet has been considered the most distributed malware in the past, it has gradually slowed down, with its last spam operation seen in November 2022. However, even then, the spamming only lasted two weeks.Cofense also confirmed to BleepingComputer that the spam campaign began at 7:00 AM ET, with current volumes remaining low.\"The first email we saw was around 7am EST. Volume remains low at this time as they continue to rebuild and gather new credentials to leverage and address books to target,\" Cofense told BleepingComputer.Instead of using reply-chain emails like in the previous campaign, the threat actors are utilizing emails that pretend to be invoices, as shown below.Attached to these emails are ZIP archives containing inflated Word documents that are over 500 MB in size. They are padded with unused data to make the files larger and harder for antivirus solutions to scan and detect them as malicious.These documents contain a mess of macros that will download the Emotet loader as a DLL from compromised sites, many of which are hacked WordPress blogs. When downloaded, Emotet will be saved to a random-named folder under %LocalAppData% and launched using regsvr32.exe.Like the Word document, the Emotet DLL has been also padded to be be 526MB to hinder the ability to detect it as malicious by antivirus software.Once running, the malware will run in the background, awaiting commands, which will likely install further payloads on the deviceThe payloads allow other threat actors to remotely access the device, which is then used to spread further in the compromised network.These attacks commonly lead to data theft and full-blown ransomware attacks on breached networks.Cofense says that they have not seen any additional payloads being dropped now, and the malware is just collecting data for future spam campaigns.While Emotet is rebuilding its network, the current method may not have much success after recent changes by Microsoft.Due to this change, users who open an Emotet document will be greeted with a message stating that the macros are disabled because the source of the file is not trusted.For most users receiving Emotet emails, this feature will likely protect them from mistakenly enabling macros unless they make a concerted effort to enable them.It would not be surprising to see Emotet also move to different attachment types after this initial campaign does not go as intended."

This means that patient information for physicians is out of reach, and the situation impacts care services.Moreover, 800 urgent cases admitted to the hospital on Sunday had to be dealt with manually, and hence more slowly, so some cases were diverted to other hospitals in Barcelona.Additional health assistants and administrative staff have been added in Clínic de Barcelona to minimize the impact and help bridge communication between the various departments.Radiology, endoscopic tests, radiological scans, dialysis, and outpatient pharmacy services will continue operating normally.Unfortunately, 150 non-urgent operations scheduled for the upcoming weeks have been canceled, and 3,000 appointments were called off.These urgent plans will remain in place for at least a couple of days more, while the time to return to normal operations is impossible to determine currently, according to Clínic Barcelona's hospital director, A. Castells.When writing this, the RansomHouse data leak site has not leaked any data belonging to the Spanish hospital, but it might be too soon for the victim to appear on the threat actor's site."

He adds, \"The aggregated risk of so many devices, often connected to a small number of single systems, means that devices of this type need to be implemented with care.\"In many ways, EV charging infrastructure represents a perfect storm of technologies. The devices are connected via mobile applications and carry the same risks as other IoT devices, but they're also set to become a critical part of transportation network in the United States, like other operational technology (OT). And because EV charging stations must be connected to public networks, ensuring that their communications are encrypted will be critical to maintaining the security of the devices, says Dragos' Tonkin.\"Hacktivists will always be looking for poorly secured devices on public networks, it's important that the owners of EV put in place controls to ensure they are not easy targets,\" he says. \"The crown jewels of the operators of EV chargers have to be their central platforms, the chargers themselves intrinsically trust the instructions pushed down from the center.\"\"It's not practical for the average domestic customer to have to put in place the right security, therefore making sure the device itself and the methods it uses to communicate with cloud-based services should always be on the vendor,\" he says.The US government should make standards and best practices available to companies to prevent cybersecurity weaknesses, some say. Sandia National Laboratories, for instance, has recommended a number of initiatives to strengthen cybersecurity, including improving EV owner authentication and authorization, adding more security to the cloud component of the charging infrastructure, and hardening the actual charging units against physical tampering.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Hackers are using pirated versions of video editing software Final Cut Pro to install malicious cryptomining software on Apple devices, according to a new report.Researchers at device management company Jamf said they have been monitoring a family of malware that has resurfaced over the past few months and has been operating undetected.Jaron Bradley, senior manager of MacOS detections at the Minneapolis-based firm, told The Record that malware disguised as or embedded inside of pirated applications has been an issue since the early days of software pirating.“Attackers see an easy opportunity when they don’t have to convince users to run their malware, but rather the users come to them willing to install something they know is illegal,” he said.Final Cut Pro, a popular suite of video-editing tools, costs about $300 for Apple users.“Apple is at a bit of a disadvantage in this particular scenario as users who opt to run pirated software have essentially already accepted that getting applications for free is worth the risk of whatever threat the application may pose,” Bradley said.The cryptomining tool – named XMRig – can be legitimately used to mine cryptocurrency on one’s own devices, but is adaptable and has been widely abused by cybercriminals.In the examples Jamf examined, hackers modified a version of Final Cut Pro to execute XMRig in the background. At the time of its discovery, Jamf said the sample was not detected as malicious by any security vendors on VirusTotal — a platform used to catalog malware. Since January, however, several vendors have begun to detect the malware.Yet in recent months researchers have found more instances of cryptomining targeting Mac users. Most Macs come equipped with powerful ARM processors which make them attractive targets for the malware, Jamf researchers said. Miners perform complex math problems for the chance to receive new coins such as bitcoin or Ethereum.The researchers traced the tainted software back to Pirate Bay, which allows people to download content and programs illegally. They saw that it was uploaded by someone who had spent years sharing pirated macOS software, and much of it was among the most widely shared versions for the respective titles.After examining each file, the researchers found that all of the person’s uploads since 2019 were compromised with malicious cryptomining malware.According to Bradley, what jumped out to his team the most was the inability of antivirus vendors to detect the malware even though some of the details around it have been shared in the past. The researchers were able to pinpoint specific changes in the cryptomining malware that allowed the hackers to dodge detection.One newer feature is that it runs a script that checks every three seconds whether the device’s Activity Monitor is active. If it finds that the Activity Monitor is active, it stops all malicious processing. The goal of the feature is to make sure that even if a victim realizes that their computer is running hotter than normal and checks to see why, they will not see the cryptominer operating.Later versions of the malware also only run when the application is launched, allowing it to hide activity until the victim uses the specific application.But Apple has created security features to combat tactics like this in newer versions of its operating system, according to Jamf. With its latest operating system update — macOS Ventura — Apple created a tool that checks whether apps have been changed by unauthorized processes, even after the first time they launch.This is a departure from past versions, where the operating system would only perform checks like that when an application was opened for the first time.On macOS Ventura, the changed version of Final Cut Pro does not even launch, according to Jamf.“This discovery presented a rare opportunity to trace the evolution of a malware family. What started as a rudimentary and conspicuous scheme had iterated through three distinct stages of evolution into something with creative evasion techniques,” they said, adding that only samples from the first generation of the malware family had been reported on.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

Its website was unavailable on Monday.The Ransom House gang — which lists semiconductor company AMD as a previous victim, claiming to have sold data stolen by its \"partners\" — was responsible for the attack, according to the regional Catalonian Cybersecurity Agency. The gang itself claims on its leak site to “have nothing to do with any breaches” and doesn’t “produce or use any ransomware.” It describes itself as a “professional mediators community.”Segi Marcén, telecommunications secretary for the regional Catalonia government, said that no extortion demand had yet been received but that the hospital would not be making a ransom payment even if one was.“We will not pay a cent,” Marcén said. Ransomware gangs typically threaten to release stolen data publicly if an extortion payment doesn’t come by a certain deadline. As of Monday, nothing from the hospital was on Ransom House’s leak site.Marcén added that the regional government was “focusing on recovering the information” impacted by the attack, although it was not yet clear whether the hospital’s data backups were also compromised, El País reported.Staff at the hospital have been forced to write on paper and do not have access to electronic patient data-sharing systems. The facility’s press department announced that urgent cases are being diverted to other hospitals.“We can’t make any prediction as to when the system will be back up to normal,” the hospital’s director, Antoni Castells, told journalists, adding that there was a contingency plan to keep services functioning for several days although he hoped the system would be fixed sooner.Tomàs Roy, the general director of the Catalan Cybersecurity Agency, said the attackers “have used new attack techniques,” but didn’t specify what they were.Recovering from the attack will be “gradual,” reported El País, as IT staff will need to ensure that systems aren’t restored while the attackers maintain some access to the system.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

They also gained administrative rights to the central storage systems via this attack path and thus compromised the central data storage,” the statement explained.“With the administrative rights obtained, the encryption of various virtualized platforms and the deletion of saved backups were finally started,” it added.The university warned that “significant amounts of data from various areas” were copied, including usernames and “cryptographically secured” passwords, email addresses and mobile phone numbers.Despite describing the compromised passwords as “cryptographically secured” the IT team recommended that students and staff change their passwords “for all internal university applications,” adding “in particular, change your password for Microsoft Teams and avoid using passwords that you have already used before.”The university said it had to rebuild its IT systems, including the existing Microsoft cloud environment, and was “trying to restore a backup of the email data from the old mail server as of December 14.”Following the attack, HAW Hamburg’s IT security said it had “received several reports from students about attempts to log on to Internet portals such as Amazon and eBay by unauthorized third parties.”“After reviewing all previous reports, and taking into account the attacker group's previous approach, it can be ruled out that the login attempts are related to the security incident at HAW Hamburg or the attacker group,” the team added.Then in February the University of Zurich, Switzerland’s largest university, announced it was the target of a “serious cyberattack,” which a spokesperson described to The Record as “part of a current accumulation of attacks on educational and health institutions.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " A new phishing campaign targets organizations in Eastern European countries with the Remcos RAT malware with aid from an old Windows User Account Control bypass discovered over two years ago.The use of mock trusted directories to bypass Windows User Account Control stands out in the attack as it's been known since 2020 but remains effective today.The latest Remcos campaign was observed and analyzed by SentinelOne researchers, who documented their findings in a report published today.The phishing campaign emails are sent from top-level domains that match the recipient's country and are typically masked as invoices, tender documentation, and other financial documents.The emails don't contain much text other than what is required to point the recipient's attention to the attachment, a tar.lz archive containing the DBatLoader executable.Such an unusual choice of file format reduces the chances of the victims successfully opening the attachment but also helps in evading detection from antivirus software and email security tools.The first stage payload of the malware loader is disguised as a Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, or PDF document using double extensions and app icons to trick the victim into opening it.Upon launching the malware loader, a second-stage payload is fetched from a public cloud service, such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive.Sentinel One reports that in one case, the cloud service was abused for hosting DBatLoader for over a month, although it's not clear if the threat actors used their own or a compromised account with a clean history.Before loading Remcos RAT, DBatLoader creates and executes a Windows batch script to abuse a Windows UAC bypassing method documented in 2020.Windows UAC is a protection mechanism that Microsoft introduced in Windows Vista, asking users to confirm the execution of high-risk applications.Some folders, such as C:\\Windows\\System32\\, are trusted by Windows, allowing executables to auto-elevate without displaying a UAC prompt. A mock directory is an imitation directory with a trailing space. For example, the \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" is a legitimate folder and is considered a trusted location in Windows. A mock directory would look like \"C:\\Windows \\System32\", with an extra space after C:\\Windows\\. The problem is that some Windows programs, like File Explorer, treat \"C:\\Windows\" and \"C:\\Windows \" as the same folder, thus tricking the operating system into thinking C:\\Windows \\System32 is a trusted folder and should have its files auto-elevate without a UAC prompt.The script used by DBatLoader, in this case, creates mock trusted directories in the same way, creating a \"C:\\Windows \\System32\" folder and copying legitimate executables (\"easinvoker.exe\") and malicious DLLs (\"netutils.dll\") to it.\"easinvoker.exe is an auto-elevated executable, meaning that Windows automatically elevates this process without issuing a UAC prompt if located in a trusted directory – the mock %SystemRoot%\\System32 directory ensures this criteria is fulfilled.\"The malware loader adds the malicious script (\"KDECO.bat\") that hides in the DLL to Microsoft's Defender exclusion list and then establishes persistence for Remcos by creating a new registry key.Eventually, Remcos is executed through process injection, configured with keylogging and screenshot-snapping capabilities.SentinelOne suggests that system administrators configure Windows UAC to \"Always Notify,\" albeit this might be too obstructive and noisy.Admins should also monitor for suspicious file creations or process executions in trust filesystem paths with trailing spaces, especially folders containing the string \"\\Windows\"."

      "title": "Alert: Scammers Pose as ChatGPT in New Phishing Scam",
      "text": " The modus operandi of this scam involves users receiving a scam email containing a link to ChatGPT, which is, of course, fake.According to Bitdefender, the scam is a “highly sophisticated financial scam” involving innovative lures, since previously, threat actors have mostly relied on weekly or monthly subscription-based lures.The email itself offers insufficient details, and the recipient has to click on an embedded link for more information. This link leads them to a fake version of the ChatGPT chatbot, where they are asked to invest at least €250 and enter their banking card details, email address, ID credentials, and phone number.Then, a copycat version of ChatGPT is delivered to the victim, which differs from the original chatbot as it offers a few pre-determined answers to the user’s queries. This chatbot was accessible only through a blacklisted domain (timegaeacom).The researchers at Bitdefender, headquartered in Bucharest, noticed that the fake ChatGPT first offered a brief introduction to how it could help them become successful investors. It asked for their email address for instant verification and their phone number for setting up a WhatsApp account for the promised investment.Afterwards, they receive a call from in which scammers claim to represent a London-based firm called Import Capital. Speaking in Romanian, the rep asks victims to invest in crypto and international stock.Further, they request crucial financial information like their permission to calculate their and their family members’ median daily salary, passive income sources, hours they daily spend working, and if they are satisfied with their current income.They are then asked to invest €250 and provide the last six digits of their valid ID card. However, while digging deeper into the scam, Bitdefender researchers requested that a link to the investment portal be sent via email. A form was sent to them, in which they inserted a false code, so the investment was declined.This campaign is quickly expanding to other regions, so users must stay alert. That’s why it is necessary to use ChatGPT only through its official website.Remember, as an AI language model, ChatGPT does not engage in any phishing scams. However, scammers are using the ChatGPT name to try to trick people into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.

      "title": "How to prevent Microsoft OneNote files from infecting Windows with malware",
      "text": " The seemingly innocuous Microsoft OneNote file has become a popular file format used by hackers to spread malware and breach corporate networks. Here's how to block malicious OneNote phishing attachments from infecting Windows.To give a little background on how we got to Microsoft OneNote files becoming the tool of choice for malware-distributing phishing attacks, we first need to explain how we got here.Threat actors have been abusing macros in Microsoft Word and Excel documents for years to download and install malware on Windows devices.These were popular file formats as a Windows bug allowed files in ISO images to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MoTW) security warnings, and the popular 7-Zip archive utility did not propagate MoTW flags to files extracted from ZIP archives.Microsoft OneNote attachments use the '.one' file extension and are an interesting choice, as they do not distribute malware through macros or vulnerabilities.Instead, threat actors create intricate templates that appear to be a protected document with a message to 'double-click' a design element to view the file, as shown below.What you do not see from the above attachment, though, is that the 'Double Click to View File' is actually hiding a series of embedded files that sit underneath the button layer, as illustrated below.When double-clicking on the button, you are double-clicking on the embedded file and causing the file to launch.While double-clicking an embedded file will display a security warning, as we know from previous phishing attacks abusing Microsoft Office macros, users commonly ignore warnings and allow the file to run anyway.Sadly, you just need one user to accidentally allow a malicious file to run for an entire corporate network to be compromised in a full blown ransomware attack.The best way to prevent malicious Microsoft OneNote attachments from infecting Windows is to block the '.one' file extension at your secure mail gateways or mail servers.However, if that is not possible for your environment, you can also use Microsoft Office group policies to restrict the launching of embedded file attachments in Microsoft OneNote files.Now that the policies are installed, you will find new Microsoft OneNote policies named 'Disable embedded files' and 'Embedded Files Blocked Extensions,' as shown below.The 'Disable embedded files' group policy is the most restrictive as it prevents all embedded OneNote files from being launched. You should enable this option if you have no use case for using embedded OneNote attachments.\"To disable the ability to embed files on a OneNote page, so people cannot transmit files that might not be caught by anti-virus software, etc,\" reads the group policy description.When enabled, the following Windows Registry key will be created. Note that the paths may differ depending on your Microsoft Office version.Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\16.0\\onenote\\options]\n\"disableembeddedfiles\"=dword:00000001Now, when a user attempts to open any attachments embedded in a Microsoft OneNote document, they will receive the following error.A less restrictive option, but potentially more unsafe, is the 'Embedded Files Blocked Extensions' group policy, which allows you to input a list of embedded file extensions that will be blocked from opening in a Microsoft OneNote document.\"To disable the ability of the users in your organization from being able to open a file attachment of a specific file type from a Microsoft OneNote page, add the extensions you want to disable using this format: '.ext1;.ext2;',\" reads the policy description.\"f you want to disable the opening of any attachment from a OneNote page, see the Disable embedded files policy. You cannot block embedded audio and video recordings (WMA & WMV) with this policy instead refer to the Disable embedded files policy.\"When enabled, the following Windows Registry key will be created with the list of blocked extensions you entered.Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\16.0\\onenote\\options\\embeddedfileopenoptions]\n\"blockedextensions\"=\".js;.exe;.bat;.vbs;.com;.scr;.cmd;.ps1\"Now, when a user attempts to open a blocked file extension in a Microsoft OneNote document, they will receive the following error.Some suggested file extensions to block are .js, .exe, .com, .cmd, .scr, .ps1, .vbs, and .lnk. However, as threat actors discover new file extensions to abuse, this list may be bypassed by other malicious file types.While blocking any file type is not always a perfect solution due to an environment's requirements, the results of not doing anything to restrict the abuse of Microsoft OneNote files can be even worse.Therefore, it is strongly advised to block OneNote attachments, or at least the abuse of embedded file types, in your environment to prevent a cyberattack."

      "title": "Dubai's Crypto Industry Introduces New Licensing Regulations - CySecurity News - Latest Information Security and Hacking Incidents",
      "text": " The framework was developed in response to the collapse of the cryptocurrency markets in 2022, which caused authorities worldwide to step up their efforts to establish or enforce protections and left businesses and investors worried about the future of cryptocurrencies. These new regulations involve the authorities seeking necessary permits and licenses in order to provide users with one or more crypto-related services in Dubai. The framework is accompanied by seven activity-based rulebooks that specify standards based on the type of service supplied and four mandatory rulebooks for service providers, which Talal Tabbaa, founder of the regional cryptocurrency exchange CoinMENA, hailed as being \"elegantly designed.\"  Dubai is one among the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates with a goal to emerge as a global hub for crypto and blockchain activities, and in order to accomplish this it was courting companies to systemize the jurisdiction even before publishing its strategized rules for the sector. In the wake of the new rules being published, the institutional crypto custody provider Hex Trust became one of the first to receive an operational green light from the emirate's watchdog, the Virtual Asset Regulation Authority.\nStating the time before VARA, which was established in 2022, Mohamed Reda El Sheikh, head of compliance at Hex Trust for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) says \"We were waiting for a licensing framework. We were waiting for somebody with interest to take the responsibility.\" However, these new regulations set up by Dubai are still a work in progress, because of their comprehensive nature, which allows for potential development. The emerging hub's new regulatory structure also reveals the expense of compliance in the area, which may make it more difficult for start-up businesses to locate there. While Tabbaa called the licencing costs \"peanuts\" when compared to other operating costs like hiring staff or maintaining offices locally, and compliance fees are not something crypto companies focus on when looking to enter a market, even he acknowledges that some of Dubai's fees can be viewed as being on the expensive side. A company seeking to provide exchange services is required to pay an application cost of 100,000 UAE dirham (US$27,200) and an annual supervision fee that is double that amount, says the document. The application fee does not guarantee acceptance, and if the business wishes to provide additional services such as custody, lending, or payments, it must submit additional licensing applications (at a 50% reduction off the application charge) and pay additional monitoring fees. For comparison, the application fee in Abu Dhabi, another emirate of the UAE, is $20,000, while the yearly monitoring fee is $15,000. However, the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) stated in an email to CoinDesk that goes up if businesses seek to provide additional kinds of assets. “Apart from any tokenized securities, under ADGM’s regulations, any crypto exchange that operates a spot or derivative market in relation to virtual assets (which include cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether) will have to apply for a Multilateral Trading Facility license,” the ADGM said. Companies that are likely to operate MTFs must pay an application fee of $125,000 and an annual supervision fee of $60,000. In Singapore, crypto exchanges that are not involved in fiat currencies usually apply for a Major Payments Institution license (for digital payment token service), which comes with a 10,000 Singapore dollar ($7,500) annual fee. Wherein, New York's BitLicense comes with a $5,000 application fee, although companies have reported bearing a cost of around $100,000 for time allocation, and legal and compliance fees. Dubai’s fees, on the other hand, are much more reasonable for larger companies. Although, it may not be very sustainable for startups, says Irina Heaver, a crypto lawyer based in the UAE. “However, I fully agree that Dubai needed to step up and to regulate the space, with so many bottom feeding scammers trying to establish here, enough is enough. Hopefully, these regulations will be used to really target those bad players,” Heaver said.\n your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " Last month, AMD released its newest AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition application driver 23.2.1 with updates to the RX 6000 and RX 7000 series.However, immediately after the release, users started complaining that the updates kept them from booting into Windows.While the issue was never acknowledged by the semiconductor company, it has been found that the same issue is also existing in AMD’s latest WQHL-certified Radeon driver, Adrenalin 23.2.2.Apparently, the issue was encountered by the editor and reviewer Brad Chacos from PCWorld, who immediately contacted AMD engineers and started working together to resolve the root problem and a temporary workaround.Now, AMD has more or less confirmed that the problem occurs when the user updates the driver while installing Windows updates. The company advises its users to abstain from using the “Factory Reset” option when updating AMD Radeon drivers, as it causes the “Inaccessible Boot Device” error, rendering the Windows installation unusable.While the issue occurs in an extremely small number of PC update instances, AMD recommends its users ensure that all system updates are applied or paused before installing the driver and the “Factory Reset” option must be unchecked when installing new AMD Radeon drivers on the computer.If the installation is carried out during a Windows update, the system can restart in factory default mode, and could even personal data from the PC.AMD has already started investigating the issue and is working on a fix for the problem.“We have reproduced an issue that can occur in an extremely small number of instances if a PC update occurs during the installation of AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition, and we are actively investigating,” said an AMD spokesperson to PCWorld.“We recommend users ensure all system updates are applied or paused before installing the driver, and that the “Factory Reset” option is unchecked during the AMD driver installation process. We are committed to resolve issues as quickly as possible and strongly encourage users to submit issues with AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition via the Bug Report Tool.”In order to minimize the risk of encountering the bug, it is advisable not to install the current WHQL driver Adrenalin 23.2.2 until AMD finds a permanent fix.Alternatively, users who depend on Windows update packages for their graphics drivers can uncheck the “Factory Reset” option while installing the Adrenalin drivers, and also use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) which prevents Windows Update from downloading drivers when the program is running."

      "text": " The regulations prohibiting the use of numerous international private messaging services in the Russian government and state entities went into effect today, according to Roskomnadzor, a Russian internet regulatory organization.The use of foreign messengers, which are defined as “information systems and computer programs owned by foreign persons. That is designed and (or) used for exchanging messages exclusively between their users. The following are among Roskomnadzor’s list of prohibited services:Unsurprisingly, Roskomnadzor’s list does not include the California-based “Zoom,” one of the world’s leading video conferencing, instant messaging, and voice call systems. Similarly, “Signal,” an encrypted messaging service, is not featured on the list.Discord and Telegram are two products mentioned above that the Russian government has previously demanded to remove “misinformation” from their services.The current prohibition, however, is not an attempt to stop the influx of foreign material that might affect local opinion but rather a precaution to stop the leakage of critical information to foreign organizations.In order to reduce the likelihood that sensitive information will be obtained by foreign intelligence, Russia is highly cautious and deliberately restricts the adoption of foreign software in essential areas.The use of foreign communication platforms is forbidden by law for those who carry out official duties or provide state services. State-run organizations are not permitted to utilize international messaging services as of March 1st, according to the Russian statute “On Information, Information Technologies, and Information Protection.” The Russian Federal Agency has outlawed apps like WhatsApp, Teams, and Skype for Business. In addition, others are to oversee mass media, information technology, and communications (Roskomnadzor) for use by state personnel. This resulted in Russian President Vladimir Putin passing the law in December 2022. State-owned businesses, municipal unitary enterprises, businesses in which the state controls more than 50% of the allowed capital, and a number of credit institutions are also subject to the prohibition.2020 Cybersecurity Landscape: 100+ Experts’ PredictionsCyber Security Predictions 2021: Experts’ ResponsesExperts’ Responses: Cyber Security Predictions 2023Celebrating Data Privacy Day – 28th January 2023Data Privacy Protection Day (Thursday 28th) – Experts Comments“Cybersecurity Awareness Month’s new evergreen theme \"Secure Our World” is…“Avoid storing data on personal devices: A crucial but often overlooked…“I recommend a new nuance to passwords that isn’t often…“In my role overseeing cloud environments and incident response, I'm…“​​Cybersecurity Awareness Month serves as a reminder to confront the…Information Security Buzz (aka ISBuzz News) is an independent resource that provides the experts comments, analysis and opinion on the latest Information Security news and topics "

      "text": " The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specification is affected by two buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to access or overwrite sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys.TPM is a hardware-based technology that provides operating systems with tamper-resistant secure cryptographic functions. It can be used to store cryptographic keys, passwords, and other critical data, making any vulnerability in its implementation a cause for concern.While a TPM is required for some Windows security features, such as Measured Boot, Device Encryption, Windows Defender System Guard (DRTM), Device Health Attestation, it is not required for other more commonly used features.However, when a Trusted Platform Module is available, Windows security features get enhanced security in protecting sensitive information and encrypting data.The new vulnerabilities in TPM 2.0 were discovered by Quarkslab’s researchers Francisco Falcon and Ivan Arce who said the flaws could impact billions of devices. The vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2023-1017 (out-of-bounds read) and CVE-2023-1018 (out-of-bounds write).Both flaws arise from how the specification processes the parameters for some TPM commands, allowing an authenticated local attacker to exploit them by sending maliciously crafted commands to execute code within the TPM.The Trusted Computing Group explains that the buffer overflow problems concern reading or writing 2 bytes after the end of the buffer passed to the ExecuteCommand() entry point.The impact of this depends on what vendors have implemented on that memory location, i.e., if it’s unused memory or if it contains live data.The CERT Coordination Center has published an alert about the vulnerabilities and has been informing vendors for months, trying to raise awareness while mapping the impact. Unfortunately, only a handful of entities have confirmed they are impacted.\"This allows either read-only access to sensitive data or overwriting of normally protected data that is only available to the TPM (e.g., cryptographic keys).\"The solution for impacted vendors is to move to a fixed version of the specification, which includes one of the following:While these flaws require authenticated local access to a device, it is important to remember that malware running on the device would meet that condition.TPM is a highly-secured space that should theoretically be shielded even from malware running on the device, so the practical importance of these vulnerabilities shouldn’t be ignored or downplayed.Users are recommended to limit physical access to their devices to trusted users, only use signed applications from reputable vendors, and apply firmware updates as soon as they become available for their devices."
