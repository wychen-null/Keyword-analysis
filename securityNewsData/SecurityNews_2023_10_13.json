      "text": " Professors at the University of South Australia and Charles Sturt University have developed an algorithm to detect and intercept man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on unmanned military robots.MitM attacks are a type of cyberattack where the data traffic between two parties, in this case, the robot and its legitimate controllers, is intercepted either to eavesdrop or to inject false data in the stream.Such malicious attacks aim to interrupt the operation of unmanned vehicles, modify the transmitted instructions, and, in some cases, even assume control, instructing the robots to take dangerous actions.\"The advent of Industry 4, marked by the evolution in robotics, automation, and the Internet of Things, has demanded that robots work collaboratively, where sensors, actuators, and controllers need to communicate and exchange information with one another via cloud services.\"\"The downside of this is that it makes them highly vulnerable to cyberattacks.\"The university researchers developed an algorithm using machine learning techniques to detect these attempts and shut them down in seconds.The algorithm was tested in a replica of the GVR-BOT used by the U.S. Army (TARDEC), and recorded successful attack prevention 99% of the time, with false positives occurring in less than 2% of the tested cases.Detecting MitM targeting crewless vehicles and robots is complex as these systems operate under fault-tolerant modes, so distinguishing between normal operations and fault conditions can be hazy.Also, robotic systems can be compromised at various levels, from the core system to its sub-systems and their sub-components, causing an operational problem that could render the robot dysfunctional..The university researchers developed a system that analyzed the robot's network traffic data to detect attempts to compromise it. This system uses node-based methods, scrutinizes packet data, and uses a flow-statistic-based system that reads metadata from the packet header.The detailed technical paper released by the researchers delves into the specifics of the deep learning CNN (convolutional neural network) model that was developed for this purpose, comprising multiple layers and filters that raise the reliability of the cyberattack detection outcome.Real tests conducted on the replica bot with simulated cyber-attacks targeting various systems produced excellent results and high identification accuracy even after only 2-3 epochs of model training.Optimized versions of this novel protection system could find applications in similar but more demanding robotic applications, like unmanned aircraft."

      "title": "Microsoft plans to kill off NTLM authentication in Windows 11",
      "text": " Microsoft announced earlier this week that the NTLM authentication protocol will be killed off in Windows 11 in the future.NTLM (short for New Technology LAN Manager) is a family of protocols used to authenticate remote users and provide session security.While it was the default protocol used in old Windows versions, NTLM is still used today, and if, for any reason, Kerberos fails, NTLM will be used instead.NTLM has also been targeted in pass-the-hash attacks, where cybercriminals exploit system vulnerabilities or deploy malicious software to acquire NTLM hashes, which represent hashed passwords, from a targeted system.Once in possession of the hash, attackers can utilize it to authenticate as the compromised user, thus gaining access to sensitive data and spread laterally on the network.However, Microsoft is now working on two new Kerberos features: IAKerb (Initial and Pass Through Authentication Using Kerberos) and Local KDC (Local Key Distribution Center).\"This leverages IAKerb to allow Windows to pass Kerberos messages between remote local machines without having to add support for other enterprise services like DNS, netlogon, or DCLocator. IAKerb also does not require us to open new ports on the remote machine to accept Kerberos messages.\"Microsoft intends to introduce the two new Kerberos features in Windows 11 to broaden its use and tackle two significant challenges leading to Kerberos fallback to NTLM.The first feature, IAKerb, enables clients to authenticate with Kerberos across a broader range of network topologies. The second feature involves a local Key Distribution Center (KDC) for Kerberos, which extends Kerberos support to local accounts.Redmond also plans to expand NTLM management controls, providing administrators with increased flexibility in monitoring and restricting NTLM usage within their environments.\"All these changes will be enabled by default and will not require configuration for most scenarios. NTLM will continue to be available as a fallback to maintain existing compatibility,\" Palko said.\"Reducing the use of NTLM will ultimately culminate in it being disabled in Windows 11. We are taking a data-driven approach and monitoring reductions in NTLM usage to determine when it will be safe to disable.\"In the meantime, you can use the enhanced controls we are providing to get a head start. Once disabled by default, customers will also be able to use these controls to reenable NTLM for compatibility reasons.\""

      "text": " Valve has announced implementing additional security measures for developers publishing games on Steam, including SMS-based confirmation codes. This is to deal with a recent outbreak of malicious updates pushing malware from compromised publisher accounts.Steamworks is a set of tools and services developers and publishers of games/software use to distribute their products on the Steam platform.It supports DRM (digital rights management), multiplayer, video streaming, matchmaking, achievements system, in-game voice and chat, microtransactions, statistics, cloud saving, and community-made content sharing (Steam Workshop).Starting in late August and into September 2023, there has been an elevated number of reports about compromised Steamworks accounts and the attackers uploading malicious builds that infect players with malware.Valve assured the gaming community that the impact of these attacks was limited to a few hundred users, who were individually informed of the potential breach via notices sent by the company.To curb this problem, Valve will enforce a new SMS-based security check starting on October 24, 2023, which game developers must pass before pushing an update on the default release branch (not beta releases).The same requirement will be enforced when someone attempts to add new users to the Steamworks partner group, which is already protected by an email-based confirmation. Starting October 24, the group admin must verify the action with an SMS code.\"The same will be true for any Steamworks account that needs to add new users. This change will go live on October 24, 2023, so be sure to add a phone number to your account now.\"\"We also plan on adding this requirement for other Steamworks actions in the future.\"For those using the SetAppBuildLive API, Steam has updated it to require a steamID for confirmation, particularly for changes to the default branch of a released app.Using 'steamcmd' to set builds live is no longer applicable for managing the default branch of released apps.Also, Valve says there will be no workaround for developers without a phone number, so they must find a way to receive text messages to continue publishing on the platform.While introducing SMS-based verification is a good step towards achieving better supply chain security on Steam, the system is far from perfect.One of the game developers, Benoît Freslon, explained that he was infected with an information-stealing malware that was used to steal his credentials.Using these stolen credentials, the threat actor briefly pushed out a malicious update for the NanoWar: Cells VS Virus that infected players with malware.Freslon explained on Twitter that Valve's new SMS-based MFA security measure wouldn't have helped stop the attack as the info-stealer malware snatched session tokens to all his accounts.The game installer dropped a password-stealing malware on his computer, which targeted his Discord, Steam, Twitch, Twitter, and other accounts.Until the tokens were revoked or expired, the attackers continued to access the developer's accounts, remaining free to push malware-laced game updates to players.Also, SMS 2FA is inherently vulnerable to SIM-swap attacks where threat actors can port the number of a game developer to a new SIM and bypass the security measure.A better and more modern solution would be to enforce authenticator apps or physical security keys, especially for projects with large communities."

      "text": " A new, lightweight variant of the RomCom backdoor was deployed against participants of the Women Political Leaders (WPL) Summit in Brussels, a summit focusing on gender equality and women in politics.The campaign used a fake website mimicking the official WPL portal to bait people seeking to attend or simply interested in the summit.In August 2023, Void Rabisu set up a malicious website on the address 'wplsummit[.]com', designed to imitate the real Women Political Leaders (WPL) website hosted on wplsummit.org.The fake site linked to a OneDrive folder through a button named 'Videos & photos,' which contained pictures from the two days of the event, taken from the genuine site, and a malware downloader named 'Unpublished Pictures.'The malicious executable is signed by an Elbor LLC certificate and is a self-extracting archive containing 56 photos to act as decoys, while a second encrypted file is downloaded from a remote host.The second payload is a DLL that is decrypted and loaded into memory to evade detection and continues to fetch additional components required for establishing communication with the attacker's server.Trend Micro identifies the latest, stripped-down variant of RomCom as the fourth major release of the backdoor, explaining that it's the same malware Volexity researchers recently named 'Peapod.'Compared to RomCom 3.0, the previous version seen in Void Rabisu operations, the new backdoor variant has undergone significant changes, making it lighter and stealthier.It now supports only the following ten commands, a stark reduction from the previous 42.Also, instead of utilizing modified MSIs to drop its components onto devices directly, the new variant leverages an EXE file to fetch XOR-encrypted DLLs, loading all its components in memory.RomCom 4.0 has also incorporated new features related to Transport Layer Security (TLS), a protocol designed to provide secure communication with the C2 server.The malware has been coded to force WinHTTP functions to specifically use the TLS version 1.2 rather than allowing the operating system to choose the default TLS version.This enforcement system results in an error on Windows 7, which Trend Micro considers safe against the newest RomCom variant.The goal of this mechanism is likely to make C2 communication more resistant to snooping, complicate automated discovery, and possibly allow attackers to filter out unsuitable victims.In general, Void Rabisu's tactics and the deployment of the RomCom malware remain cloudy. However, it is clear that the backdoor's development is still ongoing, and its operators are increasingly focused on top-level cyber espionage.Trend Micro concludes that it is very likely that Void Rabisu will target all big conferences related to special interest groups, so caution is advised when visiting event sites."

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineEmail security provider Cofense has discovered a new phishing campaign comprising over 800 emails and using LinkedIn Smart Links.The campaign was active between July and August 2023 and involved various subject themes, such as financial, document, security, and general notification lures, reaching users’ inboxes across multiple industries.The financial, manufacturing and energy sectors are the top targeted verticals.Cofense estimated that “this campaign was not a direct attack on any one business or sector but a blanket attack to collect as many credentials as possible using LinkedIn business accounts and Smart Links to carry out the attack.”LinkedIn Smart Links, also known as slinks, are used by LinkedIn business accounts to deliver content and track user content engagements through the LinkedIn Sales Navigator.A typical Smart Link uses the LinkedIn domain followed by a ‘code’ parameter with an eight-alphanumeric character ID that may contain underscores and dashes. However, malicious Smart Links can include other parts of information, such as obfuscated victim emails.Smart Links have proven to bypass security email gateways (SEGs) and other email security suites due to the link using a trusted domain.This new trove of Smart Links-based phishing messages suggests that these accounts are either newly created or previously compromised LinkedIn business accounts, allowing threat actors insight into the phishing campaign with its tracking capabilities.Upon clicking a malicious LinkedIn Smart Link embedded in an email, the user will be sent directly or through a series of redirects to the phish.The designated phishing kit will read the victim’s email attached to the Smart Link to autofill the malicious form to add to the illusion of legitimacy that the victim has landed at the legitimate Microsoft sign-in. However, a Smart Link will still lead to a credential phishing page without the victim’s email in the URL.Once at the phish, the user will be instructed to log in using their Microsoft Office credentials.LinkedIn Smart Links have been used in malicious phishing campaigns for a while now.Cofense identified large-scale phishing attacks using LinkedIn Smart Links as early as 2021. The company also reported on a large-scale campaign using slinks in September 2022.However, this is not a phishing method that malicious actors regularly use."

However, other threat actors continued to share the original 23andMe leak throughout cybercrime communities and forums.In response to an inquiry, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the hackers accessed its platform through credential-stuffing attacks on weakly secured accounts. However, they refuted claims of a direct security breach of their systems.A 23andMe spokesperson explained that the attackers initially gained unauthorized access to a small number of accounts but eventually exfiltrated the data of a larger yet undefined number of clients due to them activating an optional feature named 'DNA Relatives,' which connects genetic relatives.Although platform members voluntarily activated the opt-in feature, not all of them accept that the involved risk of internal data-sharing should exempt the firm from its responsibility to place protection layers.In this case, many people following proper security practices by enabling 2FA on their accounts and using a strong and unique password still found themselves exposed, and their sensitive data leaked on cybercrime forums.The lawsuits highlight a lack of information in the company's official announcement regarding the security event, the current status of customer data safety, the network breach's duration, and the cyberattack's exact mechanism.Also, they criticize 23andMe for failing to implement adequate security measures that would help monitor its network for abnormal activity and potentially take action to stop the intrusion much sooner.The legal actions emphasize that 23andMe, a company managing sensitive medical data, should have been well aware of the elevated cybersecurity threats given the numerous high-profile breaches in the industry, underscoring the high value of such data.The plaintiffs ask for various financial reliefs against 23andMe, including restitution, lifetime credit monitoring, actual, compensatory, and statutory damages and penalties, punitive damages, and coverage of attorney's fees."

The attack involves the use of malicious archive files that exploit the recently discovered vulnerability affecting the WinRAR compression software versions prior to 6.23 and traced as CVE-2023-38831.The lure file consists in a PDF document, contained in the archive, that shows a list of Indicator of Compromise (IoCs) with domain names and hashes related to different malware, including SmokeLoader, Nanocore RAT, Crimson RAT and AgentTesla. Due to the vulnerability, the click on the PDF file causes a BAT script to be executed, which launches PowerShell commands to open a reverse shell that gives the attacker the access to the targeted machine and a PowerShell script that steals data, including login credentials, from the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers. To exfiltrate the data, attackers uses the legit web service webhook[.]site. The lure sample is an archive file named IOC_09_11.rar, probably with the intention of masquerading itself as a file to be used to share Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

      "text": " A threat actor is using compromised Skype and Microsoft Teams accounts to distribute DarkGate, a troublesome loader associated with multiple malicious activities, including information theft, keylogging, cryptocurrency miners, and ransomware such as Black Basta.Forty-one percent of the targets of the campaign — which appears to have begun in August — are organizations in the Americas, according to researchers at Trend Micro who are tracking the activity.The operator of the DarkGate campaign that Trend Micro is currently tracking is using both Skype and Teams to distribute the malware. In one of the attacks, the threat actor took control of a Skype account belonging to an individual at an organization with whom the target recipient's organization had a trusted relationship. The adversary basically used the compromised Skype account to hijack an existing message thread and send a message that appeared to contain a PDF file but was actually a malicious VBS script. When the recipient executed the file, it initiated a sequence of steps to download and install DarkGate on the target computer.In another attack that Trend Micro analyzed, the threat actor attempted to achieve the same outcome using a Teams account to send a message with a malicious .LNK file, to a target recipient. Unlike the Skype caper, where the threat actor purported to be someone belonging to a trusted third party, in the Teams variation, the recipient received the malicious message from an unknown, external entity. \"In this case, the organization’s system allowed the victim to receive messages from external users, which resulted in them becoming a potential target of spam,\" Trend Micro said.\"We also observed a tertiary delivery method of using a VBA script wherein a .LNK file arrives in a compressed file from the originators' SharePoint site,\" the security vendor said. In this attack variation, the threat actor attempts to lure the victim to a specific SharePoint site, to download a file named \"Significant company changes September.zip.\"DarkGate is malware that has targeted users in various regions around the world since at least 2017. It integrates multiple relatively potent functions; for instance, the malware can execute commands for gathering system information, mapping networks, and doing directory traversal. It also implements remote desktop protocol (RDP), hidden virtual network computing, AnyDesk, and other remote access software. Other \"features\" include ones related to cryptocurrency mining, keylogging, privilege escalation, and stealing information from browsers.For payload delivery and execution, DarkGate uses AutoIT, a legitimate Windows automation and scripting tool that authors of other malware families have used for obfuscation and defense evasion.Trend Micro said it was able to contain the DarkGate attacks it observed before any actual harm came to pass. But given the developer's apparent pivot to a new malware leasing model, enterprise security teams can expect more attacks from varied threat actors. The objectives of these adversaries could vary, meaning organizations need to keep an eye out for threat actors using DarkGate to infect systems with different kinds of malware.While the attacks that Trend Micro observed targeted individual Skype and Teams recipients, the attacker's goal clearly was to use their systems as an initial foothold on the target organization's networks. \"The goal is still to penetrate the whole environment, and depending on the threat group that bought or leased the DarkGate variant used, the threats can vary from ransomware to cryptomining,\" according to Trend Micro.The security firm recommends that organizations enforce rules around the use of instant messaging applications such as Skype and Teams. These rules should include blocking external domains, controlling the use of attachments and implementing scanning measures if possible. Multifactor authentication is also crucial to prevent threat actors from misusing illegally obtained credentials to hijack IM accounts, Trend Micro said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Malicious NuGet packages appearing to have over 2 million downloads impersonate crypto wallets, crypto exchange, and Discord libraries to infect developers with the SeroXen remote access trojan.NuGet is an open-source package manager and software distribution system that operates package hosting servers to enable users to download and use them for their development projects.All six packages in Disti's repository contain the same XML file that downloads 'x.bin,' an obfuscated Windows batch file that carries out malicious activities on the compromised system.The packages mimic popular cryptocurrency projects, exchanges, and platforms, even featuring the official logos to trick users.The download numbers are believed to be inflated and may not be representative of the reach of these packages in the NuGet community.Still, these download counts effectively enhance the perceived credibility of the packages, making them seem like genuine versions of the apps or platforms implied by their names.Disti might have inflated the download figures using automated scripts, botnets,  virtual machines, or cloud containers that download a package many times.The packages incorporate two PowerShell scripts that execute CMD and Batch files during installation on the victim's computer.The script downloads a file from an external URL, saves it as \".cmd\" on a temp directory, and executes it without displaying anything on the screen.This script fetches another file named 'x.bin,' which, despite its name, is an obfuscated batch script with over 12,000 lines, and its purpose is to construct and execute yet another PowerShell script.Eventually, that final script reads portions from the cmd file to decrypt and decompress an encoded payload from within itself, which Phylum says is SeroXen RAT.This feature-rich remote access trojan is marketed as a legitimate program and sold for $15/month or a single \"lifetime\" purchase of $60."

      "text": " The U.S. government has updated the list of tools AvosLocker ransomware affiliates use in attacks to include open-source utilities along with custom PowerShell, and batch scripts.In a joint cybersecurity advisory, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also share a YARA rule for detecting malware in the guise of a legitimate network monitoring tool.AvosLocker ransomware affiliates are known to use legitimate software and open-source code for remote system administration to compromise and exfiltrate data from enterprise networks.The FBI observed the threat actors using custom PowerShell, web shells, and batch scripts to move laterally on the network, increase their privileges, and to disable security agents on the systems.In the updated advisory, the agencies share the following tools as being part of the arsenal of AvosLocker ransomware affiliates:Additional publicly available tools observed in AvosLocker attacks include Notepad++, RDP Scanner, and 7zip. Legitimate native Windows tools like PsExec and Nltest were also seen.Another component of AvosLocker attacks is a piece of malware called NetMonitor.exe, which poses as a legitimate process and “has the appearance of a legitimate network monitoring tool.”However, NetMonitor is a persistence tool that hails from the network every five minutes and acts as a reverse proxy that enables the threat actors to remotely connect to the compromise network.Using details from the investigation of “an advanced digital forensics group,” the FBI created the YARA rule below to detect NetMonitor malware on a network.CISA and the FBI recommend organizations to implement application control mechanisms to control the execution of software, including allowed programs, as well as prevent running portable versions of unauthorized utilities, especially remote access tools.Part of the best practices for defending against threat actors are restrictions for using remote desktop services, such as RDP, by limiting the number of login attempts and implementing phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA).Applying the principle of least privileges is also part of the recommendations, and organizations should disable command-line, scripting, and the use of PowerShell for users that don’t require them for their job.Keeping software and code updated to the latest version, using longer passwords, storing them in a hashed format, and salting them if the logins are shared, and segmenting the network, remain the constant recommendations from security experts."

      "text": " A newly discovered campaign dubbed \"Stayin' Alive\" has been targeting government organizations and telecommunication service providers across Asia since 2021, using a wide variety of \"disposable\" malware to evade detection.Most of the campaign's targets seen by cybersecurity firm Check Point are based in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Vietnam, while the campaign is still underway.The attacks appear to originate from the Chinese espionage actor known as 'ToddyCat,' which relies on spear-phishing messages carrying malicious attachments to load a variety of malware loaders and backdoors.The researchers explain that the threat actors use many different types of custom tool, which they believe are disposable to help evade detection and prevent linking attacks to each other..\"The wide set of tools described in this report are custom-made and likely easily disposable. As a result, they show no clear code overlaps with any known toolset, not even with each other,\" explains Check Point.The attack begins with a spear-phishing email crafted to target specific individuals in key organizations, urging them to open the attached ZIP file.The archive contains a digitally signed executable named to match the email context and a malicious DLL that exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2022-23748) in Audinate's Dante Discovery software to side-load  the \"CurKeep\" malware on the system.CurKeep is a 10kb backdoor that establishes persistence on the breached device, sends system info to the command-and-control (C2) server, and then waits for commands.The backdoor can exfiltrate a directory list for the victim's Program Files, indicating what software is installed on the computer, execute commands and send the output to the C2 server, and handle file-based tasks as instructed by its operators.Beyond CurKeep, the campaign utilizes other tools, mainly loaders, executed primarily through similar DLL side-loading methods.Notable ones include the CurLu loader, CurCore, and CurLog loader, each with unique functionalities and infection mechanisms.CurCore is the most interesting of the secondary payloads, as it can create files and populate their contents with arbitrary data, execute remote commands, or read a file and return its data in base64 encoded form.Another notable backdoor that stands out from the rest is 'StylerServ,' which acts as a passive listener that monitors traffic on five ports (60810 through 60814) for a specific XOR-encrypted configuration file ('stylers.bin').The report does not specify the exact functionality or purpose of StylerServ or stylers.bin, but it is likely part of a stealthy configuration serving mechanism for other malware components.The security company says the newly identified cluster is likely a segment of a broader campaign involving more undiscovered tools and attack methods.Judging from the wide variety of distinct tools seen in the attacks and their level of customization, these appear to be disposable.Over the past year, Kaspersky observed a parallel cluster of activity from the same threat actor, different from the one seen by Check Point, with two attack variants employing legitimate VLC executables to load malware using the DLL sideloading technique.A notable malware deployed in these attacks is 'Ninja Agent,' which features file management, reverse shell, process management, and more.Other tools ToddyCat deployed in these attacks include LoFiSe (file tracker and stealer), Cobalt Strike (penetration testing suite), DropBox Uploader, and a passive UDP backdoor."

Sophos X-Ops observed unsuccessful attempts to deploy ransomware through the unpatched services.\"Fortunately, their attempt to deploy the ransomware payloads on the victim's systems was thwarted, preventing the attackers from encrypting the target's data.Even though they failed to encrypt the files, the threat actors still demanded a $500 ransom, payable by October 15, Moscow Standard Time.The low ransom demand hints at Internet-exposed and vulnerable WS_FTP servers likely being targeted in mass automated attacks or by an inexperienced ransomware operation.\"We do recommend upgrading to the most highest version which is 8.8.2. Upgrading to a patched release, using the full installer, is the only way to remediate this issue,\" Progress said.\"From our analysis of WS_FTP, we found that there are about 2.9k hosts on the internet that are running WS_FTP (and also have their webserver exposed, which is necessary for exploitation).

Moreover, Shadow has implemented additional defenses to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.The firm assures the impacted customers that the compromised service provider did not hold any other user data beyond what is highlighted in the notice.BleepingComputer contacted Shadow with questions regarding the incident, and we will update this post with their statement.Last night, a threat actor claimed to be responsible for the attack and is selling the stolen database on a well-known hacking forum.The threat actor claims that they breached Shadow at the end of September and were able to steal the data for 533,624 users.\"At the end of September, I gained access to the database of the French company Shadow. It contains only customers, not all Shadow users,\" reads the for sale post.\"After an attempt at amicable settlement, which they deliberately ignored, I decided to put the database up for sale.\"The threat actor also says IP connection logs were stolen in the breach in addition to the other data already confirmed by Shadow.BleepingComputer has not independently confirmed if the sold data belongs to Shadow customers."
