      "text": " The Emotet malware operation is again spamming malicious emails as of Tuesday morning after a three-month break, rebuilding its network and infecting devices worldwide.Emotet is a notorious malware distributed through email containing malicious Microsoft Word and Excel document attachments. When users open these documents and macros are enabled, the Emotet DLL will be downloaded and loaded into memory.Once Emotet is loaded, the malware will sit quietly, waiting for instructions from a remote command and control server.While Emotet has been considered the most distributed malware in the past, it has gradually slowed down, with its last spam operation seen in November 2022. However, even then, the spamming only lasted two weeks.Cofense also confirmed to BleepingComputer that the spam campaign began at 7:00 AM ET, with current volumes remaining low.\"The first email we saw was around 7am EST. Volume remains low at this time as they continue to rebuild and gather new credentials to leverage and address books to target,\" Cofense told BleepingComputer.Instead of using reply-chain emails like in the previous campaign, the threat actors are utilizing emails that pretend to be invoices, as shown below.Attached to these emails are ZIP archives containing inflated Word documents that are over 500 MB in size. They are padded with unused data to make the files larger and harder for antivirus solutions to scan and detect them as malicious.These documents contain a mess of macros that will download the Emotet loader as a DLL from compromised sites, many of which are hacked WordPress blogs. When downloaded, Emotet will be saved to a random-named folder under %LocalAppData% and launched using regsvr32.exe.Like the Word document, the Emotet DLL has been also padded to be be 526MB to hinder the ability to detect it as malicious by antivirus software.Once running, the malware will run in the background, awaiting commands, which will likely install further payloads on the deviceThe payloads allow other threat actors to remotely access the device, which is then used to spread further in the compromised network.These attacks commonly lead to data theft and full-blown ransomware attacks on breached networks.Cofense says that they have not seen any additional payloads being dropped now, and the malware is just collecting data for future spam campaigns.While Emotet is rebuilding its network, the current method may not have much success after recent changes by Microsoft.Due to this change, users who open an Emotet document will be greeted with a message stating that the macros are disabled because the source of the file is not trusted.For most users receiving Emotet emails, this feature will likely protect them from mistakenly enabling macros unless they make a concerted effort to enable them.It would not be surprising to see Emotet also move to different attachment types after this initial campaign does not go as intended."

This means that patient information for physicians is out of reach, and the situation impacts care services.Moreover, 800 urgent cases admitted to the hospital on Sunday had to be dealt with manually, and hence more slowly, so some cases were diverted to other hospitals in Barcelona.Additional health assistants and administrative staff have been added in Clínic de Barcelona to minimize the impact and help bridge communication between the various departments.Radiology, endoscopic tests, radiological scans, dialysis, and outpatient pharmacy services will continue operating normally.Unfortunately, 150 non-urgent operations scheduled for the upcoming weeks have been canceled, and 3,000 appointments were called off.These urgent plans will remain in place for at least a couple of days more, while the time to return to normal operations is impossible to determine currently, according to Clínic Barcelona's hospital director, A. Castells.When writing this, the RansomHouse data leak site has not leaked any data belonging to the Spanish hospital, but it might be too soon for the victim to appear on the threat actor's site."

He adds, \"The aggregated risk of so many devices, often connected to a small number of single systems, means that devices of this type need to be implemented with care.\"In many ways, EV charging infrastructure represents a perfect storm of technologies. The devices are connected via mobile applications and carry the same risks as other IoT devices, but they're also set to become a critical part of transportation network in the United States, like other operational technology (OT). And because EV charging stations must be connected to public networks, ensuring that their communications are encrypted will be critical to maintaining the security of the devices, says Dragos' Tonkin.\"Hacktivists will always be looking for poorly secured devices on public networks, it's important that the owners of EV put in place controls to ensure they are not easy targets,\" he says. \"The crown jewels of the operators of EV chargers have to be their central platforms, the chargers themselves intrinsically trust the instructions pushed down from the center.\"\"It's not practical for the average domestic customer to have to put in place the right security, therefore making sure the device itself and the methods it uses to communicate with cloud-based services should always be on the vendor,\" he says.The US government should make standards and best practices available to companies to prevent cybersecurity weaknesses, some say. Sandia National Laboratories, for instance, has recommended a number of initiatives to strengthen cybersecurity, including improving EV owner authentication and authorization, adding more security to the cloud component of the charging infrastructure, and hardening the actual charging units against physical tampering.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Hackers are using pirated versions of video editing software Final Cut Pro to install malicious cryptomining software on Apple devices, according to a new report.Researchers at device management company Jamf said they have been monitoring a family of malware that has resurfaced over the past few months and has been operating undetected.Jaron Bradley, senior manager of MacOS detections at the Minneapolis-based firm, told The Record that malware disguised as or embedded inside of pirated applications has been an issue since the early days of software pirating.“Attackers see an easy opportunity when they don’t have to convince users to run their malware, but rather the users come to them willing to install something they know is illegal,” he said.Final Cut Pro, a popular suite of video-editing tools, costs about $300 for Apple users.“Apple is at a bit of a disadvantage in this particular scenario as users who opt to run pirated software have essentially already accepted that getting applications for free is worth the risk of whatever threat the application may pose,” Bradley said.The cryptomining tool – named XMRig – can be legitimately used to mine cryptocurrency on one’s own devices, but is adaptable and has been widely abused by cybercriminals.In the examples Jamf examined, hackers modified a version of Final Cut Pro to execute XMRig in the background. At the time of its discovery, Jamf said the sample was not detected as malicious by any security vendors on VirusTotal — a platform used to catalog malware. Since January, however, several vendors have begun to detect the malware.Yet in recent months researchers have found more instances of cryptomining targeting Mac users. Most Macs come equipped with powerful ARM processors which make them attractive targets for the malware, Jamf researchers said. Miners perform complex math problems for the chance to receive new coins such as bitcoin or Ethereum.The researchers traced the tainted software back to Pirate Bay, which allows people to download content and programs illegally. They saw that it was uploaded by someone who had spent years sharing pirated macOS software, and much of it was among the most widely shared versions for the respective titles.After examining each file, the researchers found that all of the person’s uploads since 2019 were compromised with malicious cryptomining malware.According to Bradley, what jumped out to his team the most was the inability of antivirus vendors to detect the malware even though some of the details around it have been shared in the past. The researchers were able to pinpoint specific changes in the cryptomining malware that allowed the hackers to dodge detection.One newer feature is that it runs a script that checks every three seconds whether the device’s Activity Monitor is active. If it finds that the Activity Monitor is active, it stops all malicious processing. The goal of the feature is to make sure that even if a victim realizes that their computer is running hotter than normal and checks to see why, they will not see the cryptominer operating.Later versions of the malware also only run when the application is launched, allowing it to hide activity until the victim uses the specific application.But Apple has created security features to combat tactics like this in newer versions of its operating system, according to Jamf. With its latest operating system update — macOS Ventura — Apple created a tool that checks whether apps have been changed by unauthorized processes, even after the first time they launch.This is a departure from past versions, where the operating system would only perform checks like that when an application was opened for the first time.On macOS Ventura, the changed version of Final Cut Pro does not even launch, according to Jamf.“This discovery presented a rare opportunity to trace the evolution of a malware family. What started as a rudimentary and conspicuous scheme had iterated through three distinct stages of evolution into something with creative evasion techniques,” they said, adding that only samples from the first generation of the malware family had been reported on.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

Its website was unavailable on Monday.The Ransom House gang — which lists semiconductor company AMD as a previous victim, claiming to have sold data stolen by its \"partners\" — was responsible for the attack, according to the regional Catalonian Cybersecurity Agency. The gang itself claims on its leak site to “have nothing to do with any breaches” and doesn’t “produce or use any ransomware.” It describes itself as a “professional mediators community.”Segi Marcén, telecommunications secretary for the regional Catalonia government, said that no extortion demand had yet been received but that the hospital would not be making a ransom payment even if one was.“We will not pay a cent,” Marcén said. Ransomware gangs typically threaten to release stolen data publicly if an extortion payment doesn’t come by a certain deadline. As of Monday, nothing from the hospital was on Ransom House’s leak site.Marcén added that the regional government was “focusing on recovering the information” impacted by the attack, although it was not yet clear whether the hospital’s data backups were also compromised, El País reported.Staff at the hospital have been forced to write on paper and do not have access to electronic patient data-sharing systems. The facility’s press department announced that urgent cases are being diverted to other hospitals.“We can’t make any prediction as to when the system will be back up to normal,” the hospital’s director, Antoni Castells, told journalists, adding that there was a contingency plan to keep services functioning for several days although he hoped the system would be fixed sooner.Tomàs Roy, the general director of the Catalan Cybersecurity Agency, said the attackers “have used new attack techniques,” but didn’t specify what they were.Recovering from the attack will be “gradual,” reported El País, as IT staff will need to ensure that systems aren’t restored while the attackers maintain some access to the system.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

They also gained administrative rights to the central storage systems via this attack path and thus compromised the central data storage,” the statement explained.“With the administrative rights obtained, the encryption of various virtualized platforms and the deletion of saved backups were finally started,” it added.The university warned that “significant amounts of data from various areas” were copied, including usernames and “cryptographically secured” passwords, email addresses and mobile phone numbers.Despite describing the compromised passwords as “cryptographically secured” the IT team recommended that students and staff change their passwords “for all internal university applications,” adding “in particular, change your password for Microsoft Teams and avoid using passwords that you have already used before.”The university said it had to rebuild its IT systems, including the existing Microsoft cloud environment, and was “trying to restore a backup of the email data from the old mail server as of December 14.”Following the attack, HAW Hamburg’s IT security said it had “received several reports from students about attempts to log on to Internet portals such as Amazon and eBay by unauthorized third parties.”“After reviewing all previous reports, and taking into account the attacker group's previous approach, it can be ruled out that the login attempts are related to the security incident at HAW Hamburg or the attacker group,” the team added.Then in February the University of Zurich, Switzerland’s largest university, announced it was the target of a “serious cyberattack,” which a spokesperson described to The Record as “part of a current accumulation of attacks on educational and health institutions.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " A new phishing campaign targets organizations in Eastern European countries with the Remcos RAT malware with aid from an old Windows User Account Control bypass discovered over two years ago.The use of mock trusted directories to bypass Windows User Account Control stands out in the attack as it's been known since 2020 but remains effective today.The latest Remcos campaign was observed and analyzed by SentinelOne researchers, who documented their findings in a report published today.The phishing campaign emails are sent from top-level domains that match the recipient's country and are typically masked as invoices, tender documentation, and other financial documents.The emails don't contain much text other than what is required to point the recipient's attention to the attachment, a tar.lz archive containing the DBatLoader executable.Such an unusual choice of file format reduces the chances of the victims successfully opening the attachment but also helps in evading detection from antivirus software and email security tools.The first stage payload of the malware loader is disguised as a Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, or PDF document using double extensions and app icons to trick the victim into opening it.Upon launching the malware loader, a second-stage payload is fetched from a public cloud service, such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive.Sentinel One reports that in one case, the cloud service was abused for hosting DBatLoader for over a month, although it's not clear if the threat actors used their own or a compromised account with a clean history.Before loading Remcos RAT, DBatLoader creates and executes a Windows batch script to abuse a Windows UAC bypassing method documented in 2020.Windows UAC is a protection mechanism that Microsoft introduced in Windows Vista, asking users to confirm the execution of high-risk applications.Some folders, such as C:\\Windows\\System32\\, are trusted by Windows, allowing executables to auto-elevate without displaying a UAC prompt. A mock directory is an imitation directory with a trailing space. For example, the \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" is a legitimate folder and is considered a trusted location in Windows. A mock directory would look like \"C:\\Windows \\System32\", with an extra space after C:\\Windows\\. The problem is that some Windows programs, like File Explorer, treat \"C:\\Windows\" and \"C:\\Windows \" as the same folder, thus tricking the operating system into thinking C:\\Windows \\System32 is a trusted folder and should have its files auto-elevate without a UAC prompt.The script used by DBatLoader, in this case, creates mock trusted directories in the same way, creating a \"C:\\Windows \\System32\" folder and copying legitimate executables (\"easinvoker.exe\") and malicious DLLs (\"netutils.dll\") to it.\"easinvoker.exe is an auto-elevated executable, meaning that Windows automatically elevates this process without issuing a UAC prompt if located in a trusted directory – the mock %SystemRoot%\\System32 directory ensures this criteria is fulfilled.\"The malware loader adds the malicious script (\"KDECO.bat\") that hides in the DLL to Microsoft's Defender exclusion list and then establishes persistence for Remcos by creating a new registry key.Eventually, Remcos is executed through process injection, configured with keylogging and screenshot-snapping capabilities.SentinelOne suggests that system administrators configure Windows UAC to \"Always Notify,\" albeit this might be too obstructive and noisy.Admins should also monitor for suspicious file creations or process executions in trust filesystem paths with trailing spaces, especially folders containing the string \"\\Windows\"."

      "title": "Alert: Scammers Pose as ChatGPT in New Phishing Scam",
      "text": " The modus operandi of this scam involves users receiving a scam email containing a link to ChatGPT, which is, of course, fake.According to Bitdefender, the scam is a “highly sophisticated financial scam” involving innovative lures, since previously, threat actors have mostly relied on weekly or monthly subscription-based lures.The email itself offers insufficient details, and the recipient has to click on an embedded link for more information. This link leads them to a fake version of the ChatGPT chatbot, where they are asked to invest at least €250 and enter their banking card details, email address, ID credentials, and phone number.Then, a copycat version of ChatGPT is delivered to the victim, which differs from the original chatbot as it offers a few pre-determined answers to the user’s queries. This chatbot was accessible only through a blacklisted domain (timegaeacom).The researchers at Bitdefender, headquartered in Bucharest, noticed that the fake ChatGPT first offered a brief introduction to how it could help them become successful investors. It asked for their email address for instant verification and their phone number for setting up a WhatsApp account for the promised investment.Afterwards, they receive a call from in which scammers claim to represent a London-based firm called Import Capital. Speaking in Romanian, the rep asks victims to invest in crypto and international stock.Further, they request crucial financial information like their permission to calculate their and their family members’ median daily salary, passive income sources, hours they daily spend working, and if they are satisfied with their current income.They are then asked to invest €250 and provide the last six digits of their valid ID card. However, while digging deeper into the scam, Bitdefender researchers requested that a link to the investment portal be sent via email. A form was sent to them, in which they inserted a false code, so the investment was declined.This campaign is quickly expanding to other regions, so users must stay alert. That’s why it is necessary to use ChatGPT only through its official website.Remember, as an AI language model, ChatGPT does not engage in any phishing scams. However, scammers are using the ChatGPT name to try to trick people into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.

      "title": "How to prevent Microsoft OneNote files from infecting Windows with malware",
      "text": " The seemingly innocuous Microsoft OneNote file has become a popular file format used by hackers to spread malware and breach corporate networks. Here's how to block malicious OneNote phishing attachments from infecting Windows.To give a little background on how we got to Microsoft OneNote files becoming the tool of choice for malware-distributing phishing attacks, we first need to explain how we got here.Threat actors have been abusing macros in Microsoft Word and Excel documents for years to download and install malware on Windows devices.These were popular file formats as a Windows bug allowed files in ISO images to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MoTW) security warnings, and the popular 7-Zip archive utility did not propagate MoTW flags to files extracted from ZIP archives.Microsoft OneNote attachments use the '.one' file extension and are an interesting choice, as they do not distribute malware through macros or vulnerabilities.Instead, threat actors create intricate templates that appear to be a protected document with a message to 'double-click' a design element to view the file, as shown below.What you do not see from the above attachment, though, is that the 'Double Click to View File' is actually hiding a series of embedded files that sit underneath the button layer, as illustrated below.When double-clicking on the button, you are double-clicking on the embedded file and causing the file to launch.While double-clicking an embedded file will display a security warning, as we know from previous phishing attacks abusing Microsoft Office macros, users commonly ignore warnings and allow the file to run anyway.Sadly, you just need one user to accidentally allow a malicious file to run for an entire corporate network to be compromised in a full blown ransomware attack.The best way to prevent malicious Microsoft OneNote attachments from infecting Windows is to block the '.one' file extension at your secure mail gateways or mail servers.However, if that is not possible for your environment, you can also use Microsoft Office group policies to restrict the launching of embedded file attachments in Microsoft OneNote files.Now that the policies are installed, you will find new Microsoft OneNote policies named 'Disable embedded files' and 'Embedded Files Blocked Extensions,' as shown below.The 'Disable embedded files' group policy is the most restrictive as it prevents all embedded OneNote files from being launched. You should enable this option if you have no use case for using embedded OneNote attachments.\"To disable the ability to embed files on a OneNote page, so people cannot transmit files that might not be caught by anti-virus software, etc,\" reads the group policy description.When enabled, the following Windows Registry key will be created. Note that the paths may differ depending on your Microsoft Office version.Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\16.0\\onenote\\options]\n\"disableembeddedfiles\"=dword:00000001Now, when a user attempts to open any attachments embedded in a Microsoft OneNote document, they will receive the following error.A less restrictive option, but potentially more unsafe, is the 'Embedded Files Blocked Extensions' group policy, which allows you to input a list of embedded file extensions that will be blocked from opening in a Microsoft OneNote document.\"To disable the ability of the users in your organization from being able to open a file attachment of a specific file type from a Microsoft OneNote page, add the extensions you want to disable using this format: '.ext1;.ext2;',\" reads the policy description.\"f you want to disable the opening of any attachment from a OneNote page, see the Disable embedded files policy. You cannot block embedded audio and video recordings (WMA & WMV) with this policy instead refer to the Disable embedded files policy.\"When enabled, the following Windows Registry key will be created with the list of blocked extensions you entered.Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\office\\16.0\\onenote\\options\\embeddedfileopenoptions]\n\"blockedextensions\"=\".js;.exe;.bat;.vbs;.com;.scr;.cmd;.ps1\"Now, when a user attempts to open a blocked file extension in a Microsoft OneNote document, they will receive the following error.Some suggested file extensions to block are .js, .exe, .com, .cmd, .scr, .ps1, .vbs, and .lnk. However, as threat actors discover new file extensions to abuse, this list may be bypassed by other malicious file types.While blocking any file type is not always a perfect solution due to an environment's requirements, the results of not doing anything to restrict the abuse of Microsoft OneNote files can be even worse.Therefore, it is strongly advised to block OneNote attachments, or at least the abuse of embedded file types, in your environment to prevent a cyberattack."

      "title": "Dubai's Crypto Industry Introduces New Licensing Regulations - CySecurity News - Latest Information Security and Hacking Incidents",
      "text": " The framework was developed in response to the collapse of the cryptocurrency markets in 2022, which caused authorities worldwide to step up their efforts to establish or enforce protections and left businesses and investors worried about the future of cryptocurrencies. These new regulations involve the authorities seeking necessary permits and licenses in order to provide users with one or more crypto-related services in Dubai. The framework is accompanied by seven activity-based rulebooks that specify standards based on the type of service supplied and four mandatory rulebooks for service providers, which Talal Tabbaa, founder of the regional cryptocurrency exchange CoinMENA, hailed as being \"elegantly designed.\"  Dubai is one among the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates with a goal to emerge as a global hub for crypto and blockchain activities, and in order to accomplish this it was courting companies to systemize the jurisdiction even before publishing its strategized rules for the sector. In the wake of the new rules being published, the institutional crypto custody provider Hex Trust became one of the first to receive an operational green light from the emirate's watchdog, the Virtual Asset Regulation Authority.\nStating the time before VARA, which was established in 2022, Mohamed Reda El Sheikh, head of compliance at Hex Trust for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) says \"We were waiting for a licensing framework. We were waiting for somebody with interest to take the responsibility.\" However, these new regulations set up by Dubai are still a work in progress, because of their comprehensive nature, which allows for potential development. The emerging hub's new regulatory structure also reveals the expense of compliance in the area, which may make it more difficult for start-up businesses to locate there. While Tabbaa called the licencing costs \"peanuts\" when compared to other operating costs like hiring staff or maintaining offices locally, and compliance fees are not something crypto companies focus on when looking to enter a market, even he acknowledges that some of Dubai's fees can be viewed as being on the expensive side. A company seeking to provide exchange services is required to pay an application cost of 100,000 UAE dirham (US$27,200) and an annual supervision fee that is double that amount, says the document. The application fee does not guarantee acceptance, and if the business wishes to provide additional services such as custody, lending, or payments, it must submit additional licensing applications (at a 50% reduction off the application charge) and pay additional monitoring fees. For comparison, the application fee in Abu Dhabi, another emirate of the UAE, is $20,000, while the yearly monitoring fee is $15,000. However, the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) stated in an email to CoinDesk that goes up if businesses seek to provide additional kinds of assets. “Apart from any tokenized securities, under ADGM’s regulations, any crypto exchange that operates a spot or derivative market in relation to virtual assets (which include cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether) will have to apply for a Multilateral Trading Facility license,” the ADGM said. Companies that are likely to operate MTFs must pay an application fee of $125,000 and an annual supervision fee of $60,000. In Singapore, crypto exchanges that are not involved in fiat currencies usually apply for a Major Payments Institution license (for digital payment token service), which comes with a 10,000 Singapore dollar ($7,500) annual fee. Wherein, New York's BitLicense comes with a $5,000 application fee, although companies have reported bearing a cost of around $100,000 for time allocation, and legal and compliance fees. Dubai’s fees, on the other hand, are much more reasonable for larger companies. Although, it may not be very sustainable for startups, says Irina Heaver, a crypto lawyer based in the UAE. “However, I fully agree that Dubai needed to step up and to regulate the space, with so many bottom feeding scammers trying to establish here, enough is enough. Hopefully, these regulations will be used to really target those bad players,” Heaver said.\n your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " Last month, AMD released its newest AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition application driver 23.2.1 with updates to the RX 6000 and RX 7000 series.However, immediately after the release, users started complaining that the updates kept them from booting into Windows.While the issue was never acknowledged by the semiconductor company, it has been found that the same issue is also existing in AMD’s latest WQHL-certified Radeon driver, Adrenalin 23.2.2.Apparently, the issue was encountered by the editor and reviewer Brad Chacos from PCWorld, who immediately contacted AMD engineers and started working together to resolve the root problem and a temporary workaround.Now, AMD has more or less confirmed that the problem occurs when the user updates the driver while installing Windows updates. The company advises its users to abstain from using the “Factory Reset” option when updating AMD Radeon drivers, as it causes the “Inaccessible Boot Device” error, rendering the Windows installation unusable.While the issue occurs in an extremely small number of PC update instances, AMD recommends its users ensure that all system updates are applied or paused before installing the driver and the “Factory Reset” option must be unchecked when installing new AMD Radeon drivers on the computer.If the installation is carried out during a Windows update, the system can restart in factory default mode, and could even personal data from the PC.AMD has already started investigating the issue and is working on a fix for the problem.“We have reproduced an issue that can occur in an extremely small number of instances if a PC update occurs during the installation of AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition, and we are actively investigating,” said an AMD spokesperson to PCWorld.“We recommend users ensure all system updates are applied or paused before installing the driver, and that the “Factory Reset” option is unchecked during the AMD driver installation process. We are committed to resolve issues as quickly as possible and strongly encourage users to submit issues with AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition via the Bug Report Tool.”In order to minimize the risk of encountering the bug, it is advisable not to install the current WHQL driver Adrenalin 23.2.2 until AMD finds a permanent fix.Alternatively, users who depend on Windows update packages for their graphics drivers can uncheck the “Factory Reset” option while installing the Adrenalin drivers, and also use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) which prevents Windows Update from downloading drivers when the program is running."

That is designed and (or) used for exchanging messages exclusively between their users. The following are among Roskomnadzor’s list of prohibited services:Unsurprisingly, Roskomnadzor’s list does not include the California-based “Zoom,” one of the world’s leading video conferencing, instant messaging, and voice call systems. Similarly, “Signal,” an encrypted messaging service, is not featured on the list.Discord and Telegram are two products mentioned above that the Russian government has previously demanded to remove “misinformation” from their services.The current prohibition, however, is not an attempt to stop the influx of foreign material that might affect local opinion but rather a precaution to stop the leakage of critical information to foreign organizations.In order to reduce the likelihood that sensitive information will be obtained by foreign intelligence, Russia is highly cautious and deliberately restricts the adoption of foreign software in essential areas.The use of foreign communication platforms is forbidden by law for those who carry out official duties or provide state services. State-run organizations are not permitted to utilize international messaging services as of March 1st, according to the Russian statute “On Information, Information Technologies, and Information Protection.” The Russian Federal Agency has outlawed apps like WhatsApp, Teams, and Skype for Business. In addition, others are to oversee mass media, information technology, and communications (Roskomnadzor) for use by state personnel. This resulted in Russian President Vladimir Putin passing the law in December 2022. State-owned businesses, municipal unitary enterprises, businesses in which the state controls more than 50% of the allowed capital, and a number of credit institutions are also subject to the prohibition.2020 Cybersecurity Landscape: 100+ Experts’ PredictionsCyber Security Predictions 2021: Experts’ ResponsesExperts’ Responses: Cyber Security Predictions 2023Celebrating Data Privacy Day – 28th January 2023Data Privacy Protection Day (Thursday 28th) – Experts Comments“Cybersecurity Awareness Month’s new evergreen theme \"Secure Our World” is…“Avoid storing data on personal devices: A crucial but often overlooked…“I recommend a new nuance to passwords that isn’t often…“In my role overseeing cloud environments and incident response, I'm…“​​Cybersecurity Awareness Month serves as a reminder to confront the…Information Security Buzz (aka ISBuzz News) is an independent resource that provides the experts comments, analysis and opinion on the latest Information Security news and topics "

      "text": " The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 specification is affected by two buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to access or overwrite sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys.TPM is a hardware-based technology that provides operating systems with tamper-resistant secure cryptographic functions. It can be used to store cryptographic keys, passwords, and other critical data, making any vulnerability in its implementation a cause for concern.While a TPM is required for some Windows security features, such as Measured Boot, Device Encryption, Windows Defender System Guard (DRTM), Device Health Attestation, it is not required for other more commonly used features.However, when a Trusted Platform Module is available, Windows security features get enhanced security in protecting sensitive information and encrypting data.The new vulnerabilities in TPM 2.0 were discovered by Quarkslab’s researchers Francisco Falcon and Ivan Arce who said the flaws could impact billions of devices. The vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2023-1017 (out-of-bounds read) and CVE-2023-1018 (out-of-bounds write).Both flaws arise from how the specification processes the parameters for some TPM commands, allowing an authenticated local attacker to exploit them by sending maliciously crafted commands to execute code within the TPM.The Trusted Computing Group explains that the buffer overflow problems concern reading or writing 2 bytes after the end of the buffer passed to the ExecuteCommand() entry point.The impact of this depends on what vendors have implemented on that memory location, i.e., if it’s unused memory or if it contains live data.The CERT Coordination Center has published an alert about the vulnerabilities and has been informing vendors for months, trying to raise awareness while mapping the impact. Unfortunately, only a handful of entities have confirmed they are impacted.\"This allows either read-only access to sensitive data or overwriting of normally protected data that is only available to the TPM (e.g., cryptographic keys).\"The solution for impacted vendors is to move to a fixed version of the specification, which includes one of the following:While these flaws require authenticated local access to a device, it is important to remember that malware running on the device would meet that condition.TPM is a highly-secured space that should theoretically be shielded even from malware running on the device, so the practical importance of these vulnerabilities shouldn’t be ignored or downplayed.Users are recommended to limit physical access to their devices to trusted users, only use signed applications from reputable vendors, and apply firmware updates as soon as they become available for their devices."

The company did not specify a date for the attack.WH Smith, which runs more than 1,700 stores primarily in the United Kingdom, is a regular on most of the country’s high streets, where it sells magazines, stationery, books and sweets.A spokesperson for the company told The Record they were unable to provide any more details at the time.WH Smith’s regulatory statement said that its investigations into the incident are ongoing and that it is notifying “all affected colleagues” and has “put measures in place to support them.”“There has been no impact on the trading activities of the Group. Our website, customer accounts and underlying customer databases are on separate systems that are unaffected by this incident,” the statement added.The move has been long-awaited. As of last November, ransomware incidents had been responsible for the majority of the British government’s recent crisis management “Cobra” meetings attended by officials across different government departments.At the time they said they were seeing “an increasingly successful business model” with “ransom demands increasing” and “payments increasing” and it becoming “harder to avoid paying a ransom because the entire ecosystem is pushing that way.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

This sustained attack allowed the threat actors to hack a total of 71,473 Chick-fil-A accounts.\"Following a careful investigation, we determined that unauthorized parties launched an automated attack against our website and mobile application between December 18, 2022 and February 12, 2023 using account credentials (e.g., email addresses and passwords) obtained from a third-party source.The fast food chain is warning impacted customers that threat actors who accessed their account would have also had access to their personal information, including their name, email address, Chick-fil-A One membership number and mobile pay number, QR code, masked credit/debit card number, and the amount of Chick-fil-A credit (e.g., e-gift card balance) on your account (if any).For some customers, the information may have included birthdays, phone numbers, physical addresses, and the last four digits of credit cards.In response to the attack, Chick-fil-A forced customers to reset passwords, froze funds loaded into accounts, and removed any stored payment information from accounts.Chick-fil-A also states that they restored Chick-fil-A One account balances and added rewards to impacted accounts as a way of apologizing.As the accounts were breached using credentials exposed in other data breaches, impacted users must change their passwords at all sites they frequent, especially if they use the same Chick-fil-A password.When resetting passwords, use a unique password for each site and store them in a password manager, like Bitwarden, so that they can be easily managed.While there is no evidence that personal information was abused, impacted customers should also be on the lookout for potentially targeted phishing emails utilizing this information."

      "text": " As companies and governments around the world work on creating usable quantum computers, security researchers are also devising ways to protect data once those machines are available.According to the Swedish team, CRYSTALS-Kyber is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, which use information leaked by a computer system to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive information. Instead of trying to guess a secret key, a side-channel technique analyzes data such as small variations in power consumption or electromagnetic radiation to reconstruct what the machine is doing and find clues that would enable access.Machine learning “can overcome conventional countermeasures,” such as “masking,” which involves hiding the secret key using random numbers. Even if someone observes the encryption process, they can't discover the key.Previous research on CRYSTALS-Kyber analyzed the algorithm with up to three “orders” of masking, but the Swedish team said it demonstrated its technique on fifth-order masking.“The presented approach is not specific for CRYSTALS-Kyber and can potentially be applied to other schemes,” the researchers said.The machine learning in the side-channel attack involved a neural network training method called recursive learning. This method made it possible to extract the smallest data units with high probability, the researchers said.“This is a very notable, and novel, aspect of the research,” said Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant who did not participate in the study.According to him, machine learning can be used to efficiently analyze data and learn patterns that reveal security weaknesses of the system. The researchers also said they could use machine learning to test algorithms for resistance to other types of attacks.The attack targeted the specific implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber, not its principles. A specific implementation of a post-quantum algorithm refers to its practical application in a software or hardware system.“As long as the core principles stand and remain robust, we'll live with those,” Olejnik said.The agency did not respond to The Record’s request for comment.According to Olejnik, it is necessary to research such attacks because they help create secure methods for implementing, deploying and utilizing the new cryptosystems.CRYSTALS-Kyber is the only general-purpose algorithm selected so far for the NIST program. Three others are used for digital signature and identity verification.Researchers need several post-quantum algorithms because it is currently unclear which ones will be most effective and secure against quantum computers.Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the first name of NIST's Dustin Moody.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

Since these sites are legitimate, their messages bypass spam filters.Unfortunately, due to these attacks involving a large number of senders, blocking the email addresses or marking their messages as spam isn’t a very effective defense method.The only way to deal with this type of threat is to set up an advanced filtering tool that will block messages based on specific criteria, such as keywords in the content."

Using a hardware wallet like Trezor adds protection from malware and compromised devices, as the wallet is not meant to be connected to your PC.When setting up a new Trezor wallet, users are given a 12 or 24-word recovery seed that can be used to recover a wallet if a device is stolen, lost, or malfunctions.However, anyone who gains access to this seed can also restore the wallet on their own devices, making them juicy targets for threat actors.Starting on February 27th, Trezor customers began receiving SMS and email phishing messages stating that Trezor had suffered a data breach. These messages prompt the target to visit a listed website to secure their device.\"Trezor Suite has recently endured a security breach, assume all your assets are vulnerable. Please follow the security procedure to secure your assets: [phishing-site],\" reads the fake Trezor data breach warning messages.When visiting the listed domain, visitors will be shown a fake Trezor site that states, \"Your assets might be at risk!\" and then prompts you to start securing your wallet.When users click the 'Start' button, they will ultimately be prompted to enter their recovery seed, which the threat actors will then steal.Once a recovery seed is stolen, it is game over for the wallet owner, as the threat actors will likely quickly transfer any assets to another address under their control.Therefore, it is vital to never share your wallet's recovery passwords, seeds, or phrases with anyone else or enter them on any sites.Trezor is aware of the phishing campaign and warned users to beware of phishing SMS and emails warning of a fake data breach. The company also states that they have not found any evidence of a recent data breach in its systems.\"Please ignore these messages as they are not from Trezor.\"\"We have not found any evidence of a recent database breach. We will never contact you via calls or SMS.\"MailChimp told BleepingComputer then that the threat actors stole data from 102 customers, with most in the cryptocurrency and finance sectors.When installed, this Trezor Suite would prompt the user to enter their recovery seed, which was then transmitted back to the threat actors.While the current phishing campaign is not using fake software, the threat actors are still attempting to steal your recovery seed. Therefore, as we said earlier, and it warrants repeating, never share your recovery seed with anyone or on any site."

      "text": " The APT27 hacking group, aka \"Iron Tiger,\" has prepared a new Linux version of its SysUpdate custom remote access malware, allowing the Chinese cyberespionage group to target more services used in the enterprise.The new malware variant is written in C++ using the Asio library, and its functionality is very similar to Iron Tiger's Windows version of SysUpdate.The observed SysUpdate campaign analyzed by Trend Micro deployed both Windows and Linux samples against valid targets.One of the victims of this campaign was a gambling company in the Philippines, whose attack utilized a command and control server registered with a domain similar to the victim's brand.The infection vector is unknown, but Trend Micro's analysts hypothesize that chat apps were used as lures to trick employees into downloading initial infection payloads.One item that has evolved compared to past campaigns relying on SysUpdate is the loading process, which now uses a legitimate and digitally-signed \"Microsoft Resource Compiler\" executable (rc.exe) to perform DLL side-loading with rc.dll to load shellcode.The shellcode loads the first stage of SysUpdate in memory, so it's difficult for AVs to detect. Then, it moves the required files to a hardcoded folder and establishes persistence with Registry modifications or by creating a service, depending on the process permissions.The second stage will launch after the next system reboot to decompress and load the primary SysUpdate payload.SysUpdate is a feature-rich remote access tool allowing a threat actor to perform a variety of malicious behavior as listed below:Trend Micro comments that Iron Tiger used a Wazuh-signed executable in later sideloading stages to blend with the victim's environment, as the target organization used the legitimate Wazuh platform.The Linux variant of SysUpdate is an ELF executable and shares common network encryption keys and file-handling functions with its Windows counterpart.The binary supports five parameters that determine what the malware should do next: setting persistence, daemonizing the process, setting a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) for the infected system, etc.The malware establishes persistence by copying a script to the \"/usr/lib/systemd/system/\" directory, an action that requires root user privileges.Upon its launch, it sends the following information to the C2 server:One new feature in the Linux SysUpdate variant is DNS tunneling, seen only on one Windows sample of the malware.SysUpdate obtains DNS information from \"/etc/resolv.conf\" file to retrieve the default system DNS IP address which can be used for sending and receiving DNS queries. If that fails, it uses Google's DNS server at 8.8.8.8.The idea of this system is to bypass firewalls or network security tools that might be configured to block all traffic beyond a specific IP address allowlist.Trend Micro says the choice of the Asio library for developing the Linux version of SysUpdate might be due to its multi-platform portability and predicts that a macOS version of the malware might appear in the wild soon."

      "text": " Cybersecurity In-DepthManaging risk on a global scale has always been challenging, but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, CISOs have had to become even more agile. The shift to hybrid work, the rapid deployment of cloud applications, and the move to continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD) have emboldened threat actors with new and broader targets.Meanwhile, the number of devices and endpoints on organizations' networks has increased exponentially. Two veteran CISOs lamented the challenges that these changes have imposed during a webinar last week organized by Sepio, an asset detection and risk management startup. Sepio CISO Ilan Kaplan moderated an hour-long discussion with HSBC CISO Monique Shivanandan and Carl Froggett, who was CISO at Citi for 17 years before joining startup Deep Instinct last summer as CIO.Shivanandan and Froggett shared with Kaplan what they see as three of the most significant challenges the rapidly changing cybersecurity and risk landscape presents.But overshadowing that benefit is the sheer scale of all the components associated with modern applications. \"An asset used to survive five, six, seven years, or longer if you include the underlying operating systems, whereas now the lifetime of the container can be measured in seconds or maybe minutes,\" Froggett said. That creates \"a whole new set of [visibility] challenges from that perspective.\"\"One of the biggest challenges that every CIO and every CISO faces is having that visibility and making sure that visibility is up to date,\" Shivanandan said.\"Unfortunately, with the number of parties we have, we cannot do it for everyone,\" she added. \"We do it for a select few.\" The problem is \"every software change and every new release can knowingly or unknowingly introduce something new. It's a constant battle that we're facing.\"Froggett said that Citi has strict processes around onboarding new technology, including pen testing and red teaming, but with the current release cadences, enforcement has become challenging. \"Ultimately, you can't usually do source code reviews\" of everything that comes in, he said.The shortage of experienced cybersecurity specialists is nothing new, but Shivanandan said it remains one of her top challenges. \"All the technology in the world is only as good as the people there to make sure that we install [everything] correctly and keep it up to date,\" she said.Despite considerable progress, Shivanandan said it remains difficult for women to break the glass ceiling. She said she believes that men have an outsized presence in senior cybersecurity roles compared with the entire IT industry.\"When you start out at the lower levels, there's [an] equal [proportion of] men and women, 50-50, sometimes even 60-40 women,\" she said. \"Then, as you go through the progression, the women drop out and the men continue to progress from a seniority level.\"Nevertheless, women face fewer barriers today compared with when she started out, Shivanandan said. \"When I was starting out, they wanted to pat you on the head and say, 'Dear, don't worry your pretty little head. I'll take care of technical things.' But not anymore,\" she said. \"There's no ceiling for a woman to get into any position now. It's a matter of just perseverance.\"Shivanandan considers herself fortunate at HSBC, where 40% of her leadership team is women. \"The women and the men are both fantastic, and that's the thing that you really want to look for,\" she said.During Froggett's nearly 25 years at Citi, most of his bosses were women, he said. \"The job's not done for sure, but there is definitely more of a balance [than what] I saw five or 10 years ago.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Cisco has addressed a critical security vulnerability found in the Web UI of multiple IP Phone models that unauthenticated and remote attackers can exploit in remote code execution (RCE) attacks.The RCE flaw (CVE-2023-20078) allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with root privileges following successful exploitation.The company also disclosed today a second high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2023-20079) that can be abused to trigger denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.Both bugs are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input and can be exploited using maliciously crafted requests sent to the targeted device's web-based management interface.The security vulnerabilities were discovered by Zack Sanchez of the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG) during internal security testing.The list of affected devices includes Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 series devices with Multiplatform Firmware (vulnerable to both RCE and DoS attacks), and the Unified IP Conference Phone 8831, Unified IP Conference Phone 8831 with Multiplatform Firmware, and Unified IP Phone 7900 Series (only vulnerable to DoS attacks).The company's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) added that it hadn't seen evidence of attempts to exploit this security flaw in attacks.While Cisco released security updates to address the CVE-2023-20078 RCE vulnerability, the company said it would not release patches to fix the CVE-2023-20079 DoS flaw.\"Cisco Unified IP Phone 7900 Series and Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831 have entered the end-of-life process,\" the company explained.While a security update for CVE-2022-20968 is not yet available, admins are advised to disable CDP on affected IP Phone devices supporting Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) to remove the attack vector."

      "title": "Lazarus's Latest Weapons: Wslink Loader and WinorDLL64 Backdoor - CySecurity News - Latest Information Security and Hacking Incidents",
      "text": " ESET researchers have found one of the payloads of the Wslink downloader that experts previously discovered in 2021. The payload is called WinorDLL64 based on its filename. Wslink, a loader for Windows binaries, is different from other loaders, it runs as a server and executes retrieved modules in memory. As the name suggests, a loader would serve as a tool to launch the payload or the malware into the infected system. Experts haven't identified the initial Wslink compromise vector yet. The WinorDLL64 is delivered by the Wslink malware downloader. These tools may be linked with the infamous North Korea-based APT group Lazarus. WinorDLL64 is a backdoor that was first found by cybersecurity experts in 2019. It is a 64-bit variant of the original Winor backdoor, which the Lazarus group used in its previous attacks. WinorDLL64 is built to be highly deceptive, which makes it difficult for experts to identify.WinorDLL64 is usually distributed via spear-phishing emails or malicious downloads. Once it compromises a system, it makes a backdoor that lets threat actors remotely gain entry and control the attacked system. It is built to avoid detection by using a number of techniques, this includes encrypting the communication process and concealing its sight on the system.WeLiveSecurity by ESET reports \"active since at least 2009, this infamous North-Korea aligned group is responsible for high-profile incidents such as both the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and tens-of-millions-of-dollar cyberheists in 2016, the WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, and a long history of disruptive attacks against South Korean public and critical infrastructure since at least 2011. US-CERT and the FBI call this group HIDDEN COBRA.\"WinorDLL64 is a highly advanced backdoor that allows threat actors full control over the compromised system. Threat actors can steal important info, add malware, and do various malicious activities while evading detection. The dangers associated with WinorDLL64 are consequential, especially for companies that depend on sensitive data or critical systems.In the case of malware, safety is fundamental when it comes to defending against WinorDLL64. Companies can take various measures to decrease the chance of compromise. This includes:Familiarizing employees with the dangers of phishing emails and inspiring them to be careful while opening attachments or suspicious links.Maintaining software and security systems up-to-date to make sure all vulnerabilities are patched. Enforcing two-factor authentication and other login controls to reduce the damage from cyberattacks. Daily monitoring of network activity and system logs for any hints of malicious behavior.Using a trusted anti-malware solution that can find and stop WinorDLL64 and various kinds of malware.In summary, we can say that WinorDLL64 is a highly effective backdoor that is a significant threat to companies. It is believed to be the work of the North Korean hacking group, Lazarus, and is designed to evade detection and provide attackers with complete control over an infected system. Organizations can take various measures to defend against WinorDLL64, this includes educating the workplace, having the latest software, enforcing access controls, checking network activity, and using anti-malware software. With a proactive approach to cybersecurity, companies can lower the threat of a successful cyber attack and safeguard their precious systems and data. your nameYour Emailyour message"
