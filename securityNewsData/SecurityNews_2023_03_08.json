      "text": "  Microsoft said they could not specify malicious intent regarding SHEIN's case but suggested that the feature of accessing clipboards was not necessary. SC Media has reached out to Shein for further information.  \"Even if SHEIN's clipboard behavior involved no malicious intent, this example case highlights the risks that installed applications can pose, including those that are highly popular and obtained from the platform's official app store,\" Microsoft said.  The tech giant identified and verified Shein’s clipboard behavior by performing static analysis of the app to find \"the relevant code responsible for the behavior\" and then doing a dynamic analysis to run the app \"in an instrumented environment to observe the code.\"  Following Microsoft's research findings, Google recognized the potential threats associated with clipboards and has made the following efforts to secure the Android platform.  Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "text": " The Emotet malware operation is again spamming malicious emails as of Tuesday morning after a three-month break, rebuilding its network and infecting devices worldwide.Emotet is a notorious malware distributed through email containing malicious Microsoft Word and Excel document attachments. When users open these documents and macros are enabled, the Emotet DLL will be downloaded and loaded into memory.Once Emotet is loaded, the malware will sit quietly, waiting for instructions from a remote command and control server.While Emotet has been considered the most distributed malware in the past, it has gradually slowed down, with its last spam operation seen in November 2022. However, even then, the spamming only lasted two weeks.Cofense also confirmed to BleepingComputer that the spam campaign began at 7:00 AM ET, with current volumes remaining low.\"The first email we saw was around 7am EST. Volume remains low at this time as they continue to rebuild and gather new credentials to leverage and address books to target,\" Cofense told BleepingComputer.Instead of using reply-chain emails like in the previous campaign, the threat actors are utilizing emails that pretend to be invoices, as shown below.Attached to these emails are ZIP archives containing inflated Word documents that are over 500 MB in size. They are padded with unused data to make the files larger and harder for antivirus solutions to scan and detect them as malicious.These documents contain a mess of macros that will download the Emotet loader as a DLL from compromised sites, many of which are hacked WordPress blogs. When downloaded, Emotet will be saved to a random-named folder under %LocalAppData% and launched using regsvr32.exe.Like the Word document, the Emotet DLL has been also padded to be be 526MB to hinder the ability to detect it as malicious by antivirus software.Once running, the malware will run in the background, awaiting commands, which will likely install further payloads on the deviceThe payloads allow other threat actors to remotely access the device, which is then used to spread further in the compromised network.These attacks commonly lead to data theft and full-blown ransomware attacks on breached networks.Cofense says that they have not seen any additional payloads being dropped now, and the malware is just collecting data for future spam campaigns.While Emotet is rebuilding its network, the current method may not have much success after recent changes by Microsoft.Due to this change, users who open an Emotet document will be greeted with a message stating that the macros are disabled because the source of the file is not trusted.For most users receiving Emotet emails, this feature will likely protect them from mistakenly enabling macros unless they make a concerted effort to enable them.It would not be surprising to see Emotet also move to different attachment types after this initial campaign does not go as intended."

We will begin rolling out early March and expect to complete by late March.\"Moving forward, in tenants where the XLL blocking will get enabled by default, an alert will be displayed when users try to enable content from untrusted locations, informing them of the potential risk and allowing them to find more information about why they're seeing the warning.This is part of a broader effort to tackle the rise of malware campaigns abusing various Office document formats as an infection vector throughout recent years.Excel XLL files are dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) used to expand the functionality of Microsoft Excel with additional features like custom functions, dialog boxes, and toolbars.Before being blocked by default, XLLs would allow attackers to infect victims that enabled the untrusted add-ins and opened them even though they were warned that the \"add-ins might contain viruses or other security hazards.\"After opening the add-ins, the malware got installed in the background without requiring user interaction.\"Their usage significantly increased over the last two years as more commodity malware families adopted XLLs as their infection vector,\" Cisco Talos said."

      "text": " A Massachusetts community college has closed its doors for a second day after a cyberattack took down significant parts of its network.Northern Essex Community College serves more than 6,000 students across Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, with campuses in Haverhill and Lawrence.A spokesperson for the school told The Record that they did not know if the attack was ransomware, and claimed they “do not have evidence of any personal data being compromised.” On Tuesday, the school confirmed it would not open for the day.“All employees with a NECC laptop should cease using their laptops and are asked to bring their computers in as soon as possible and leave them in your office so that our IT team can install protection-clients and perform forensics.”The statement adds that remote work will be suspended for the rest of the week due to issues with VPN access, but employees of the college will be required to come to their offices. Microsoft Office 365, Zoom and some web-based services are still functioning, the college said.The college contacted law enforcement and cybersecurity experts to help with an investigation. They urged students and employees to regularly change passwords and said anyone whose information may have been accessed will be contacted with guidance.Since then, Emsisoft ransomware expert Brett Callow said at least 10 colleges have been hit with ransomware or cyberattacks, including last week’s attacks on colleges in Tennessee and Louisiana.“By the end of February this year, there were 19 incidents. The yearly numbers have remained very similar too, having remained within the range of 84 - 89 incidents per year since 2019,” Callow told The Record.“It’s clear that we’re not getting a handle on ransomware in the education sector. In fact, the problem may even be getting worse.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News. Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014.

This means that patient information for physicians is out of reach, and the situation impacts care services.Moreover, 800 urgent cases admitted to the hospital on Sunday had to be dealt with manually, and hence more slowly, so some cases were diverted to other hospitals in Barcelona.Additional health assistants and administrative staff have been added in Clínic de Barcelona to minimize the impact and help bridge communication between the various departments.Radiology, endoscopic tests, radiological scans, dialysis, and outpatient pharmacy services will continue operating normally.Unfortunately, 150 non-urgent operations scheduled for the upcoming weeks have been canceled, and 3,000 appointments were called off.These urgent plans will remain in place for at least a couple of days more, while the time to return to normal operations is impossible to determine currently, according to Clínic Barcelona's hospital director, A. Castells.When writing this, the RansomHouse data leak site has not leaked any data belonging to the Spanish hospital, but it might be too soon for the victim to appear on the threat actor's site."
