It appears that some malware operators also took this time as an opportunity to possibly rest, refocus, and reanalyze their current procedures and activities.In T2 2022, we saw the continuation of the sharp decline of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) attacks, which likely continued to lose their steam due to the Russia-Ukraine war, along with the post-COVID return to offices and overall improved security of corporate environments.Even with declining numbers, Russian IP addresses continued to be responsible for the largest portion of RDP attacks. In T1 2022, Russia was also the country that was most targeted by ransomware, with some of the attacks being politically or ideologically motivated by the war. However, as you will read in the ESET Threat Report T2 2022, this hacktivism wave has declined in T2, and ransomware operators turned their attention towards the United States, China, and Israel.In terms of threats mostly impacting home users, we saw a sixfold increase in detections of shipping-themed phishing lures, most of the time presenting the victims with fake DHL and USPS requests to verify shipping addresses.A web skimmer known as Magecart, which saw a threefold increase in T1 2022, continued to be the leading threat going after online shoppers’ credit card details. The plummeting cryptocurrency exchange rates also affected online threats – criminals turned to stealing cryptocurrencies instead of mining them, as seen in a twofold increase in cryptocurrency-themed phishing lures and rising numbers of cryptostealers.During the past few months, we have continued to share our knowledge at the Virus Bulletin, Black Hat USA, RSA, CODE BLUE, SecTor, REcon, LABSCon, and BSides Montreal cybersecurity conferences, where we disclosed our findings about campaigns deployed by OilRig, APT35, Agrius, Sandworm, Lazarus, and POLONIUM.

      "text": " This article was updated on 10/7/22 with further information.Hackers have reportedly stolen 2 million Binance Coins (BNB), worth $566 million, from the Binance Bridge.Soon after the hacker began spreading some of the funds across a variety of liquidity pools, attempting to transfer the BNB into other assets.Binance acknowledged the security incident at 6:19 PM EST and paused the BNB Smart Chain while they investigated the incident.At 7:51 PM EST, the CEO of Binance tweeted that an exploit was used in the BSC Token Hub to transfer the BNB to the attacker and that they had asked all validators to suspend the Binance Smart Chain.\"We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC. The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.\"While the majority of the stolen funds remain on the BNB Smart Chain, and are now inaccessible to the hacker, Binance estimates that between $70M - $80M were taken off-chain.Working with partners in the cryptocurrency community, $7 million of those off-chain assets have already been frozen.Update 10/7/22: At approximately 2:30 AM EST Friday, Binance again resumed the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and enabled deposits and withdrawals on Binance.In a further update on Binance.com, the company apologized to the community for the attack and thanked partners and validators for their swift response.While Binance says they will provide a postmortem with further details in the future, they confirmed that 2 million BNB was stolen using an exploit on the BSC Token Hub.A total of 2 million BNB was withdrawn. The exploit was through a sophisticated forging of the low level proof into one common library.\"This is a developing story."

The exploit can be used multiple times, allowing the attacker to get a new token every time the old one expires.“The cause of the bug is the implementation of the consent page,” Dex maintainer Maksim Nabokikh tells The Daily Swig.“This page is supposed to protect users from sharing too much profile data with the application. Instead, it created a hole in Dex. If fraudsters can access this page before a user, they can steal not only all the user’s data but also impersonate it.”When the victim navigates to the malicious website, Dex returns a 302 Redirect to the connector IDP, according to a GitHub security advisory. The exploit then involves recording the state parameter value g3dkmpontsr3ugocoddjx72ef, which later becomes the request ID.The website subsequently redirects the victim’s browser to the connector IDP, to which the user authenticates. And if the user has authenticated before, authentication may be carried out without a challenge, with the connector IDP redirecting the browser to the Dex callback with a code.Dex then fetches the user claims from the connector IDP, persisting them and generating an OAuth code, before redirecting the browser to the approval endpoint. The reproduction steps conclude with Dex using the request ID to look up the OAuth code, and building a redirect to the original callback .The flaw, which has a CVSS rating of 9.3, affects versions 2.34.0 and earlier, with users advised to update to version 2.35.0. Those using Google connector should upgrade to 2.35.1 instead.The patch was created by Sigstore developers Hayden Blauzvern, Bob Callaway, and ‘joernchen’, the original reporter of the bug.The fix involved introducing a hash-based message authentication (HMAC) code, which uses a randomly generated per-request secret that can’t be known to an attacker and is persisted between the initial login request and the approval request.Burp SuiteVulnerabilitiesCustomersCompanyInsights© 2023 PortSwigger Ltd."

      "title": "The Majority of PostgreSQL Servers on the Internet are Insecure | by Jonathan Mortensen | The Inner Join",
      "text": " The Inner Join--2ListenShareThe situation doesn’t stop with PostgreSQL servers: most popular SQL clients are more than happy to accept unencrypted connections without a warning. We conducted an informal survey of 22 popular SQL clients and found that only two require encrypted connections by default. Another six will ask for encryption but silently accept an unencrypted connection. The remaining 14 require the user to opt-in to using SSL; connections are unencrypted by default.When you connect to a website through your web browser, data you send and receive is probably encrypted. It’s amazing, then, that data sent to and from Internet-connected PostgreSQL servers is very likely unencrypted. It’s a problem.Simply having a certificate isn’t enough. Almost 12,000 (4.0%) of the certificates were expired (Figure 1). Furthermore, more than 128,000 (43.3%) of the certificates were self-signed. Connections to servers with self-signed certificates are encrypted, but the certificates often do not confer trust: generally, they are neither issued nor validated by a certificate authority, they don’t expire, and they can’t be revoked. Most clients do not have a root certificate for a given self-signed certificate, so they can’t connect using verify-full, without which clients are subject to man-in-the-middle attacks (more on this later).This leaves us with 160,310 PostgreSQL servers with certificates that are neither expired nor self-signed. Connections to these servers still are not guaranteed to be encrypted as many PostgreSQL clients do not enable SSL connections by default, and those that do won’t necessarily validate the server’s certificate by default. Similarly, PostgreSQL servers that support SSL and have valid SSL certificates do not always require that those certificates be used. Supporting encryption sounds better than nothing, but given insecure client defaults, it’s not that much better than no encryption.We found that, from the approximately 820,000 PostgreSQL servers in the survey, 64% did not support SSL. Another 23% supported but definitely did not require the use of SSL. Only 7% likely or definitely required encryption. For another 7%, we were able to establish that SSL was supported but could make no further inferences about whether its use was required.This is a sad state of affairs. The vast majority of PostgreSQL servers listening on the Internet either do not support encrypted connections at all or they support encryption but accept unencrypted traffic. It gets worse: SQL clients have a say in whether to use encryption when connecting to a PostgreSQL server, and most of them are more than happy to not. To understand this insecure behavior, we have to take a moment to understand how SSL actually works with PostgreSQL.For the purpose of this post, there are three important things to understand about how SSL connections work in PostgreSQL.We did a survey of five popular PostgreSQL programming language libraries and 22 SQL clients to see what their default encryption options are and whether the user can easily change those options.The standard PostgreSQL library for Python is psycopg (2 and 3), which uses libpq, so its default mode is to prefer ssl. This means the connection methods will first attempt an encrypted connection but then fall back to an unencrypted method if the server does not support SSL. The other language libraries surveyed — jdbc, npgsql, node-postgres, and pgx — have SSL disabled by default, so the user is responsible for configuring encryption (Table 1).None of these libraries used verify-full, require, or allow settings. Libraries that default to verify-full will validate server certificates (most secure).require means that the connection will be closed if the server does not support SSL. And allow means that the client will first attempt an unencrypted connection but will accept an encrypted connection if the server requires it.We took an informal survey of SQL clients and checked their default encryption options (Table 2). We saw a few different settings in this sample. Postico is the only one that defaults to verify-full, meaning that it will validate the server certificate and warn the user if it fails.Most clients have SSL disabled by default, and provide only two options for enabling it (Figure 3). It is often not clear which setting is enabled by toggling SSL on, though some clients provide advanced configuration options that, for instance, allow the user to provide certificate files.Where does this leave us? Most PostgreSQL servers either don’t support or don’t require encrypted connections. And most clients, by default, will attempt an unencrypted connection and won’t warn you if your connection is unencrypted and you’re at risk of exposing data. There’s no 🔒 icon and no ⚠️ warning message like in the browser.If you are a developer: use sslmode verify-full in your client. In some programming languages you’ll need to point the library to your certificate store — We’re looking at you Java — but that’s a short amount of pain for a lifetime of better security.If you are a user: make sure SSL is enabled in your clients and if possible set your sslmode to verify-full.If you make a PostgreSQL tool: set your defaults to use verify-full. Postico provides a great example of how to gracefully degrade to insecure with user consent.If you’re a maintainer of PostgreSQL itself: change from insecure to secure defaults in the next major release! It’s time. We think it’s highly unlikely that all of these insecure servers and clients are intentionally insecure.If these changes can’t be made in the upcoming PG15 release, at the very least add warnings of deprecation, of insecure configurations, and of a looming configuration default change and then do it in PG16.There are two common arguments against this analysis and moving to encryption as a default that we’d like to address directly:These points may have been true ten years ago. With >800k servers accessible on the Internet and with the move toward SaaS data tools and databases that lower the bar to entry, the data world is no longer only in secure environments and only used by experts. It’s full of nocode/locode users and data analysts focusing on delivering value, not sysadmin and security engineering. Let’s set them up to do things securely by default with clear escape hatches, just like the browsers have done.Shodan uses the Python psycopg2 package to connect to each PostgreSQL server and record the resulting message. psycopg2 uses libpq, which defaults to sslmode=prefer. With this approach, shodan’s client will first attempt to connect with SSL, and, upon receiving an error message during authentication, will make a second connection attempt without encryption. Depending on the content in these error messages and whether each server has an SSL certificate, we can infer the SSL mode of most of the servers.Specifically, we used the following logic:The PostgreSQL sslconfiguration parameters configures TLS encrypted connections. Here and throughout, we use “SSL” for simplicity.A quick dance between a client and a server determines whether a connection will use SSL. A client may ask to use SSL (via an SSLRequest message) and the server may accept that request or deny that request (via an S or N response). In the case of receiving an N response, the client can then choose to either accept an unencrypted connection or to abort.An additional step, Certificate validation, may occur during the TLS handshake. Certificate validation is the process by which the client determines whether the certificate presented by the server is legitimate. Certification validation prevents malicious servers from impersonating the true server to which a client intended to connect (i.e., a man-in-the-middle attack). Many books have been written on this topic — for this post, just consider it an important, required feature for secure encryption.Most PostgreSQL clients have a setting, often named “sslmode”, that specifies which path(s) to try. For libpq, which is the underlying library for most clients, the settings are:Each PostgreSQL client and tool must choose a default. And, these defaults are often selected for backward compatibility rather than security. In the core PostgreSQL client library, libpq, and the one used by the psql command line tool, the default is prefer.“The default value for sslmode is prefer. […] this makes no sense from a security point of view, and it only promises performance overhead if possible. It is only provided as the default for backward compatibility, and is not recommended in secure deployments.”So, you may think that because a PostgreSQL client supports SSL that it will create an encrypted connection to a server. But, that’s not always the case! You can unknowingly be sending your critical database traffic in the clear because your client uses a default of prefer, allow or disable and the server you’re connecting to does not support SSL. You probably won’t get warnings on the client or the server, either.So, you may think that because a PostgreSQL server supports SSL (but does not require SSL) that your client will create an encrypted connection to that server. But, that’s not always the case! You can unknowingly be sending your critical database traffic in the clear because your client uses a default of allow or disable while the server you’re connecting to does, in fact, support SSL. You probably won’t get warnings on the client or the server, either.python: the standard is psycopg [2 & 3] and that uses libpq, so the default is prefer, and it’s easy enough to change to verify-full. By default, you are at risk if the server doesn’t support SSL, since psycopg will silently connect to that server without telling you the connection is not encrypted. You are also at risk because the client doesn’t care if the certificate given by the server is valid.----2The Inner JoinJonathan MortenseninThe Inner Join--Daniel LideninThe Inner Join--2Daniel LideninThe Inner Join--Jonathan Mortenseninbit.io--Carlos Arguelles--39Mohammad FaisalinLevel Up Coding--10Dmitry Romanoff--3Vaishnav ManojinDataX Journal--118Chris Chin--1Sumit Kumar Sharan--HelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams"

      "text": " Meta has sued several Chinese companies doing business as HeyMods, Highlight Mobi, and HeyWhatsApp for developing and allegedly using \"unofficial\" WhatsApp Android apps to steal over one million WhatsApp accounts starting May 2022.Once installed, the apps (including AppUpdater for WhatsPlus 2021 GB Yo FM HeyMods and Theme Store for Zap) used bundled malware to harvest sensitive info, including account authentication, to hijack their WhatsApp accounts to send spam messages.\"After victims installed the Malicious Applications, they were prompted to enter their WhatsApp user credentials and authenticate their WhatsApp access on the Malicious Applications,\" the complaint adds.\"The Defendants programmed the Malicious Applications to communicate the user's credentials to WhatsApp's computers and obtain the users' account keys and authentication information (collectively, 'access information').\"AppUpdater for WhatsPlus alone was installed by more than one million Android users, according to its Google Play Store entry.​The head of WhatsApp at Meta, Will Cathcart, warned users in July not to download modified versions of WhatsApp and gave as examples HeyMods' and HeyWhatsApp's apps.\"Recently our security team discovered hidden malware within apps – offered outside of Google Play - from a developer called \"HeyMods\" that included \"Hey WhatsApp\" and others,\" Cathcart said.\"These apps promised new features but were just a scam to steal personal information stored on people's phones. We've shared what we found with Google and worked with them to combat the malicious apps.\"Starting in mid-July, Android's Google Play Protect was updated to detect and disable previously downloaded malicious fake versions of WhatsApp on users' Android devices after Meta alerted Google of their findings.While part of the complaint is focused on how the malicious applications were used to steal account info to hijack WhatsApp accounts, Meta is suing the three companies for breaching WhatsApp's terms of use and Meta's developer agreement.As Meta says, the defendants agreed and were bound by the WhatsApp Terms when they created various WhatsApp accounts. They also agreed and were bound by the Meta Terms, Platform Terms, and Developer Policies after creating Facebook Pages and apps.However, by taking the actions detailed above, they breached their agreement with WhatsApp and Meta, causing WhatsApp to sustain damages, including the resources used to investigate their fraudulent scheme."

      "text": " \n         February 17, 2021\n      A security researcher has discovered a series of vulnerabilities within Telegram that could let attackers send modified animated stickers, which could have exposed the victims’ data.Instant messaging apps seem to have one thing in common: Security researchers always find some kind of image or cleverly crafted message that can interfere with the functionality, either freezing the app or the phone or allowing attackers to take control. In either case, the problem is not limited to a single app.“During my research I have identified 13 vulnerabilities in total: 1 heap out-of-bounds write, 1 stack out-of-bounds write, 1 stack out-of-bounds read, 2 heap out-of-bound read, 1 integer overflow leading to heap out-of-bounds read, 2 type confusions, 5 denial-of-service (null-ptr dereferences),” said the researcher.“All the issues I have found have been responsibly reported to and fixed by Telegram with updates released in September and October 2020,” he explained. This means that, if you’ve only used Telegram in the last four months, you have nothing to worry about.It’s worth noting that it’s not a single vulnerability responsible for this security issue, which means it’s unlikely to be deployed in the wild. It also requires a high degree of technical expertise, making it available only to sophisticated criminal gangs.The research also shows why it’s worth keeping all of your devices and software up to date — developers often fix the problems long before the vulnerabilities become public knowledge.tagsSilviu is a seasoned writer who followed the technology world for almost two decades, covering topics ranging from software to hardware and everything in between.\n         November 08, 2023\n      \n         August 10, 2023\n      \n         July 13, 2023\n      \n         June 08, 2023\n      \n         November 21, 2023\n      \n         November 17, 2023\n      \n         November 17, 2023\n      \n            © 2023 Bitdefender.

      "text": " Linux users have reported seeing weird white flashes and rapid blinking on their Intel laptop displays after upgrading to Linux kernel version 5.19.12, leading to warnings that the bug may damage displays.Linux kernel version 5.19.12 isn't experimental or beta but a point release of the stable branch that came out on September 28, 2022.Syrjä recommended immediate reversion of the Linux Kernel to an older version to avoid causing hardware damage on people's machines and to publish a recommendation that \"no one using laptops with Intel GPUs run 5.19.2\".Unfortunately, this realization came after many users had already upgraded to the buggy Linux version, risking damage to their systems and becoming forced to apply kernel version downgrades.\"This release is to resolve a regression on some Intel graphics systems that had problems with 5.19.12. If you do not have this problem with 5.19.12, there is no need to upgrade,\" reads the release announcement.However, given the delay in pushing Linux kernel upgrades on many other distributions, the buggy version might land on some of them later.Users are advised to check the kernel version numbers before upgrading and avoid Linux 5.19.12 if they're using an Intel laptop.Those already impacted by the bug are advised not to leave their displays operating in the blinking mode for long, as this increases the chances of causing irreversible damage to the screen.Typically, bootloaders allow users to pick from the last three kernel versions, so reverting to a non-problematic version shouldn't be too hard.If you don't see the option on Grub, press and hold the \"Shift\" button on your keyboard while booting.The next milestone will be version 6.1, which will likely be the first to support Rust, a high-performance memory-safe programming language that provides raw speed and flexibility."
