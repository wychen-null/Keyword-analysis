      "title": "Critical RCE vulnerability impacts 29 models of DrayTek routers",
      "text": " Researchers at Trellix have discovered a critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability impacting 29 models of the DrayTek Vigor series of business routers.The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2022-32548 and carries a maximum CVSS v3 severity score of 10.0, categorizing it as critical.The attacker does not need credentials or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability, with the default device configuration making the attack viable via the internet and LAN.Hackers who exploit this vulnerability could potentially perform the following actions:DrayTek Vigor devices became very popular during the pandemic by riding the \"work from home\" wave. They are excellent cost-efficient products for VPN access to small and medium-sized business networks.A Shodan search returned over 700,000 online devices, most located in the UK, Vietnam, Netherlands, and Australia.Using a specially crafted pair of credentials as base64 encoded strings in the login fields, one can trigger the flaw and take control of the device's OS.The researchers found at least 200,000 of the detected routers to expose the vulnerable service on the internet and hence are readily exploitable without user interaction or any other special prerequisites.Of the remaining 500,000, many are also believed to be exploitable using one-click attacks, but only via LAN, so the attack surface is smaller.The vulnerable models are the following:"

      "text": " We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.\n        Paranoid's library contains implementations of checks for well known weaknesses on cryptographic artifacts.\n      \n        Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL.\n    Your codespace will open once ready.There was a problem preparing your codespace, please try again.Paranoid project checks for well known weaknesses on cryptographic artifacts\nsuch as public keys, digital signatures and general pseudorandom numbers.\nThis library contains implementations and optimizations of existing work found\nin the literature. The existing work showed that the generation of these\nartifacts was flawed in some cases. The following  are some examples of\npublications the library is based on.The goal is to increase the confidence in cryptography use cases inside and\noutside Google.When dealing with asymmetric encryption, crypto artifacts usually are:With Paranoid, any cryptographic artifact can be tested, but its primary\nmotivation is to detect the usage of weak third party hardware or software black\nboxes. Hence, Paranoid can be used even if we are not able to inspect the source\ncode (situation 3. listed above).The project aims to detect known vulnerabilities as well as unknown ones. E.g.,\nit tries to identify vulnerabilities caused by programming errors or the use of\nweak proprietary random number generators. Detecting new vulnerabilities is of\ncourse much more difficult than detecting known ones. Such detections may\nrequire large sets of artifacts or find weak ones only with a low probability.Clone the repository:$ git clone https://github.com/google/paranoid_crypto.git && cd paranoid_cryptoNOTE: The commands below have been tested on Debian latest stable version\n(bullseye). Make sure you will be using python3.9 or newer.Install dependencies:$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pybind11 python3-fpylll libgmp-dev protobuf-compilerInstall paranoid_crypto python package:$ python3 -m pip install .To check whether the installation was successful, you can run the unit tests.\nFor example:After cloning the repository, build the docker image:$ docker build -t paranoid-img .Create and start the container:To check whether the installation was successful, you can run the unit tests.\nFor example:Some of these certificates were already expired or revoked. For the ones that\nwere still active (most of the CheckGCD ones), we immediately reported them to\nthe Certificate Authorities to be revoked.If you use Paranoid in your research, you can cite it using the following\nBibTeX:\n        Paranoid's library contains implementations of checks for well known weaknesses on cryptographic artifacts.\n      "

      "text": " \n\nAugust 4, 2022\n\nCyber Front Z, a pro-Russian troll operation exposed in the days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, “was clumsy and largely ineffective — definitely not ‘A team’ work,” security officials with Meta said Thursday. The accounts were “low in sophistication, represented no distinct personas and were essentially fungible,” the company wrote in its analysis. “A large portion of them were detected and disabled by automation even before we found their link to this activity.”“The time span has shrunk from years to weeks,” he said.The group’s tactics had evolved beyond other previous IRA-linked operations, the company said. Whereas in the past the idea was to create legions of phony accounts, this operation created a smaller number of credible fake accounts that existed across multiple platforms, “and tried to co-opt unwitting journalists by recruiting them to work for non-existent NGOs or news outlets.”In some cases, the accounts copied and pasted pro-Ukraine comments “from the very groups [Cyber Front Z] explicitly opposed,” the report reads. “This might be a case of individual operators undermining this fictitious movement from within.”Ultimately the group seemingly isn’t that successful, the report concludes, noting that it appeared to fake engagement on the back end, perhaps to convince their funders or employers. “Some influence operations try to capitalize on public fear of influence operations by falsely claiming they were successful,” Nimmo said Thursday. “Taking them at face value would mean they’re believing they’re effective when they’re not.” "

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\n              SearchImmediate Actions You Can Take Now to Protect Against Malware:In 2021, the top malware strains included remote access Trojans (RATs), banking Trojans, information stealers, and ransomware. Most of the top malware strains have been in use for more than five years with their respective code bases evolving into multiple variations. The most prolific malware users are cyber criminals, who use malware to deliver ransomware or facilitate theft of personal and financial information.CISA and ACSC encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations sections of this joint CSA. These mitigations include applying timely patches to systems, implementing user training, securing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), patching all systems especially for known exploited vulnerabilities, making offline backups of data, and enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA).The top malware strains of 2021 are: Agent Tesla, AZORult, Formbook, Ursnif, LokiBot, MOUSEISLAND, NanoCore, Qakbot, Remcos, TrickBot and GootLoader.Updates made by malware developers, and reuse of code from these malware strains, contribute to the malware’s longevity and evolution into multiple variations. Malicious actors’ use of known malware strains offers organizations opportunities to better prepare, identify, and mitigate attacks from these known malware strains.The most prolific malware users of the top malware strains are cyber criminals, who use malware to deliver ransomware or facilitate theft of personal and financial information.Below are the steps that CISA and ACSC recommend organizations take to improve their cybersecurity posture based on known adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CISA and ACSC urge critical infrastructure organizations to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats immediately by (1) updating software, (2) enforcing MFA, (3) securing and monitoring RDP and other potentially risky services, (4) making offline backups of your data, and (5) providing end-user awareness and training.As part of a longer-term effort, implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and functionality. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware and threat actor lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks. The ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which Australian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents affecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions outside their control.The information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

      "text": " Security researchers found a new service called Dark Utilities that provides an easy and inexpensive way for cybercriminals to set up a command and control (C2) center for their malicious operations.The Dark Utilities service provides threat actors a platform that supports Windows, Linux, and Python-based payloads, and eliminates the effort associated with implementing a C2 communication channel.A C2 server is how adversaries control their malware in the wild, sending out commands, configurations and new payloads, and receiving data collected from compromised systems.The Dark Utilities operation is a 'C2-as-a-service' (C2aaS) that advertises reliable, anonymous C2 infrastructure and all the required additional functions for a starting price of just EUR 9,99.Multiple architectures are supported and it appears that the operators are planning on expanding the list to provide a larger set of options of devices that could be targeted.Cisco Talos researchers say that selecting an operating system generates a command string that \"threat actors are typically embedding into PowerShell or Bash scripts to facilitate the retrieval and execution of the payload on victim machines.\"The selected payload also establishes persistence on the target system by creating a Registry key on Windows, or a Crontab entry or a Systemd service on Linux.According to the researchers, the administrative panel comes with multiple modules for various types of attack, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and cryptojacking.With tens of thousands of threat actors already subscribed and the low price, Dark Utilities is likely to attract an even larger crowd of less-skilled adversaries."

      "title": "Resolved: Microsoft blocks Tutanota users from own service: Tutanota users can't register a Microsoft Teams account.",
      "text": " We have contacted Microsoft support a while ago about the issue that Tutanota users were unable to register Microsoft Teams\naccounts with their Tutanota domain email addresses. However, Microsoft responded to us that fixing the issue was\n\"not feasible\" (read original post below for more details).They fixed the issue in August, finally defining all Tutanota domains as \"public domains\" - the way it should be for an\nemail service and the way we had requested from Microsoft when first contacting them.While the issue has been resolved pretty quickly by Microsoft after the right people contacted us following the media attention, we still\nbelieve that this example shows why we need better antitrust regulations.It is not fair that a Big Tech company can ignore a small company's request to fix an issue that effects its users\nfor months, and is only interested in fixing the issue after it received bad publicity because of this.After all, not every small company has the option to go public, possibly because the media will decide their issue is\nnot worth talking about or because they simply do not have established media contacts and find it hard to get through\nto the right people.While we are very happy that this particular issue has now been fixed for all Tutanota users, we still believe\nthat there must be a better way for companies to contact Big Tech and request fixes from them - one where they can \nnot simply answer to the request with \"Sorry, fixing the issue you are having is not feasible for us.\"Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are discussing stronger antitrust legislation to regulate Big Tech. These laws\nare badly needed as the example of Microsoft blocking Tutanota users from registering a Teams account demonstrates.\nThe problem: Big Tech companies have the market power to harm smaller\ncompetitors with some very easy steps like refusing smaller companiesâ customers from using their own services.Currently, Microsoft is actively blocking Tutanota email addresses from registering a Microsoft Teams account.\nThis severe anti-competitive practice forces our customers to register a second email address â possibly one from Microsoft\nthemselves â to create a Teams account.When asked to change the current situation, a spokesperson for Microsoft simply said it would not be possible for them to\nallow people to register a Teams account with a Tutanota email address. Period. We repeatedly tried to solve the issue with\nMicrosoft, but unfortunately our request was ignored.This is just one example of how Microsoft can and does abuse its dominant market position to harm competitors, which in\nturn also harms consumers.The last successful antitrust case in tech happened in 1995 against Microsoft. At the time, Microsoft was one of the biggest\ntech companies as almost every computer was running Microsoft Windows. Back in the nineties Microsoft bundled their Internet\nExplorer browser into Windows OS so that every computer being sold also came with their built-in browser.The case United States vs. Microsoft made the news back then. Microsoft lost the case and was no longer allowed to bundle\nthe Windows operating system with the Internet Explorer.Weakening Microsoft paved the way for a period of technological innovation. Following this successful antitrust case new\ntech companies emerged that have since adopted the practice of abusing their market power to stifle competition themselves:\nGoogle, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.At first glance, the deal consumers get from Big Tech is very beneficial, after all they can use the product for free.\nHowever, targeted advertisement also makes people pay.By knowing consumers so well, Big Tech can place ads at the right moment and at the right price. For every major turn\nin life, the appropriate ad will appear. Say, you are invited to a baby shower. Ultimately you will be bombarded with\nads for babyâs clothes and toys, but maybe a handmade gift would be much more suitable?Consumers will lose the ability to make free and independent decisions due to the never-ending presence of advertisements\nand their influence.The aim of Big Tech is to make you spend money â and they are very successful with that.In recent years the demand for privacy is constantly rising. Big Tech companies such as Microsoft can not easily deliver\nthis as a large part of their business relies on the profits made from targeted advertisements â and for that they need\nto track their users.âWe need to break up the market power of Big Tech like we did in the nineties. This will lead to a new evolution in\ntodayâs online world. One where products rise that concentrate on benefiting the consumer â not maximizing ad revenueâ,\nsays Pfau. âTo free oneself from being tracked online, people need privacy-respecting alternatives. We have built a\nfully encrypted email service â Tutanota. We respect peopleâs privacy and protect their private emails from malicious\nattacks, prying eyes, and ad-based tracking. Due to the built-in encryption, tracking is impossible in Tutanota.\"\"However, competing with Microsoft is nigh impossible given their sheer market power.\""

      "title": "New Linux malware brute-forces SSH servers to breach networks",
      "text": " A new botnet called 'RapperBot' is being used in attacks since mid-June 2022, focusing on brute-forcing its way into Linux SSH servers to establish a foothold on the device.The researchers show that RapperBot is based on the Mirai trojan but deviates from the the original malware's normal behavior, which is uncontrolled propagation to as many devices as possible.Instead, RapperBot is more tightly controlled, has limited DDoS capabilities, and its operation appears geared towards initial server access, likely to be used as stepping stones for lateral movement within a network.Over the past 1.5 months since its discovery, the new botnet used over 3,500 unique IPs worldwide to scan and attempt brute-forcing Linux SSH servers.The new botnet was discovered in the wild by threat hunters at Fortinet, who noticed the IoT malware featured some unusual SSH-related strings and decided to investigate further.RapperBot proved to be a Mirai fork, but with its own command and control (C2) protocol, unique features, and atypical (for a botnet) post-compromise activity.\"The bulk of the malware code contains an implementation of an SSH 2.0 client that can connect and brute force any SSH server that supports Diffie-Hellmann key exchange with 768-bit or 2048-bit keys and data encryption using AES128-CTR.\"The SSH brute-forcing relies on a list of credentials downloaded from the C2 via host-unique TCP requests, while the malware reports back to the C2 when it succeeded.Fortinet researchers followed the bot and continued to sample new variants, noticing that RapperBot used a self-propagation mechanism via a remote binary downloader, which was removed by the threat actors in mid-July.The newer variants circulating at that time featured a shell command that replaced the victim's SSH keys with the actor's, essentially establishing persistence that's maintained even after SSH password changes.Moreover, RapperBot added a system to append the actor's SSH key to the host's \"~/.ssh/authorized_keys,\" which helps maintain access on the server between reboots or even if the malware is found and deleted.In the most recent samples analyzed by the researchers, the bot adds the root user \"suhelper\" on the compromised endpoints and creates a Cron job that re-adds the user every hour in case an admin discovers the account and deletes it.Also, it's worth noting that the malware authors added extra layers of obfuscation to the strings in later samples, like XOR encoding.Most botnets either perform DDoS attacks or engage in coin-mining by hijacking the host's available computational resources, and some do both.The goal of RapperBot, however, isn't evident, as the authors have kept its DDoS functions limited and even removed and re-introduced them at some point.Also, the removal of self-propagation and the addition of persistence and detection-avoidance mechanisms indicate that the botnet's operators may be interested in initial access sales to ransomware actors.Fortinet reports that its analysts saw no additional payloads delivered post-compromise during the monitoring period, so the malware just nests on the infected Linux hosts and sits dormant."

      "text": " The Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) was forced to shut down all of its IT systems and switch off digital services, telephones, and email servers, in response to a cyberattack.DIHK is a coalition of 79 chambers representing companies within the German state, with over three million members comprising businesses ranging from small shops to large enterprises in the country.The organization deals with legal representation, consultation, foreign trade promotion, training, regional economic development, and offers general support services to its members.Some services for companies are being made gradually available again after a thorough checking to ensure that it would be safe to use them. However, the restoration is only partial at this time.The General Manager of DIHK, Michael Bergmann, has informed the public via a LinkedIn post that the cyberattack occurred yesterday, Wednesday, and characterized the incident as 'massive.'\"At this stage, we cannot predict how long the (urgent shutdown) measures will be necessary,\" commented Bergmann.While the cyberattack carries the signs of ransomware, with systems being shut down to prevent the spread of the malware, this hasn't been officially confirmed yet.Also, there have been no announcements of successfully compromising DIHK on any of the major ransomware extortion sites, although it would be too early for that.For example, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Köln informed the public that phone lines work to a limited extent, while its website was still offline at the time of this writing.In Köln's case, the shutdown of the systems is also presented as a precautionary measure, which further strengthens the hypothesis of a ransomware attack.Bleeping Computer is in the process of collecting more information on the incident, and we will update this post as soon as we know more."

      "text": " A threat actor is said to have \"highly likely\" exploited a security flaw in an outdated Atlassian Confluence server to deploy a never-before-seen backdoor against an unnamed organization in the research and technical services sector.The attack, which transpired over a seven-day-period during the end of May, has been attributed to a threat activity cluster tracked by cybersecurity firm Deepwatch as TAC-040.Following reports of active exploitation in real-world attacks, the issue was addressed by the Australian company on June 4, 2022.Not much is known about TAC-040 other than the fact that the adversarial collective's goals could be espionage-related, although the possibility that the group could have acted out of financial gain hasn't been ruled out, citing the presence of a loader for an XMRig crypto miner on the system.While there is no evidence that the miner was executed in this incident, the Monero address owned by the threat actors has netted at least 652 XMR ($106,000) by hijacking the computing resources of other systems to illicitly mine cryptocurrency.The attack chain is also notable for the deployment of a previously undocumented implant called Ljl Backdoor on the compromised server. Roughly 700MB of archived data is estimated to have been exfiltrated before the server was taken offline by the victim, according to an analysis of the network logs.The malware, for its part, is a fully-featured trojan virus designed to gather files and user accounts, load arbitrary .NET payloads, and amass system information as well as the victim's geographic location. \"The victim denied the threat actor the ability to laterally move within the environment by taking the server offline, potentially preventing the exfiltration of additional sensitive data and restricting the threat actor(s) ability to conduct further malicious activities,\" the researchers said.Discover how application detection, response, and automated behavior modeling can revolutionize your defense against insider threats.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."
