      "text": " A new malware wiper known as BiBi-Linux is being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies.The malware reveals its true nature by not dropping a ransom note or providing victims with a way to reach out to the attackers to negotiate payment for a decryptor, even though it fakes file encryption,\"Instead, it conducts file corruption by overwriting files with useless data, damaging both the data and the operating system.\"The payload (an x64 ELF executable named bibi-linux.out) found on the victim's systems allows the attackers to choose what folders to encrypt via command-line parameters.It can completely wipe a compromised device's operating system when run with root privileges if the attackers do not provide a target path, as it will attempt to delete the entire '/' root directory.BiBi-Linux uses multiple threads and a queue system for improved speed and effectiveness. It will overwrite files' contents to destroy them, renaming them using a ransom name and an extension made out of the 'BiBi' string (Bibi is a nickname used for Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu) followed by a number.As seen by BleepingComputer, the number appended to the extension is the number of rounds a file has been wiped.The wiper sample discovered by Security Joes also features no obfuscation, packing, or other protective measures, making malware analysts' jobs much easier.This shows the threat actors are not concerned about their tools being captured and dissected, instead focusing on maximizing their attack's impact.Destructive malware has also been used extensively by Russian threat groups to target the systems of Ukrainian organizations since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022."

Brown (also facing legal action from regulatory authorities), knew about. Instead, the company reportedly disclosed only broad and theoretical risks to its investors.\"Rather than address these vulnerabilities, SolarWinds and Brown engaged in a campaign to paint a false picture of the company's cyber controls environment, thereby depriving investors of accurate material information.\"The regulator claims that Brown was already aware that attackers that would hack SolarWinds' systems remotely would be very hard to detect since at least 2018, according to presentations saying that the \"current state of security leaves us in a very vulnerable state for our critical assets\" and that \"[a]ccess and privilege to critical systems/data is inappropriate.\"Brown also expressed concerns in June 2020 that attackers could use SolarWinds' Orion software (which was trojanized by the Russian hackers to breach customers' systems months later) as a tool in future attacks because the company's backend systems were not \"resilient.\"Two months before the attack, the SEC says that a SolarWinds internal document revealed that the engineering teams were no longer able to keep up with a long list of new security issues that they had to address.\"We made a deliberate choice to speak—candidly and frequently—with the goal of sharing what we learned to help others become more secure. We partnered closely with the government and encouraged other companies to be more open about security by sharing information and best practices.\"The SEC's charges now risk the open information-sharing across the industry that cybersecurity experts agree is needed for our collective security.\"The malicious builds were used to drop the Sunburst backdoor onto the systems of \"fewer than 18,000\" victims. However, the attackers handpicked a substantially lower number of targets for second-stage exploitation.Update October 30, 18:14 EDT: A SolarWinds spokesperson sent the following statement after the article was published:We are disappointed by the SEC’s unfounded charges related to a Russian cyberattack on an American company and are deeply concerned this action will put our national security at risk. The SEC’s determination to manufacture a claim against us and our CISO is another example of the agency’s overreach and should alarm all public companies and committed cybersecurity professionals across the country.

Typically, it modifies the registry or creates scheduler tasks on Windows systems. The experts reported that the malicious code also uses multiple methods on Linux as well.The functionality within the malware modules are divided into two types, service and extended functionality modules.The malware uses the modules for storing its configuration, upgrading and uninstalling itself, establishing a reverse proxy, harvesting credentials, performing reconnaissance and files, taking screenshots, executing processes, recording microphone input, and mining for Monero.While investigating this malware, Kaspersky also discovered an apparently related ransomware variant called. Similarities include the Tor client and multiple modules observed in StripedFly.“What was the real purpose? That remains a mystery.

      "title": "A cascade of compromise: unveiling Lazarus' new campaign | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories27 Oct 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsEarlier this year, a software vendor was compromised by the Lazarus malware delivered through unpatched legitimate software. What’s remarkable is that these software vulnerabilities were not new, and despite warnings and patches from the vendor, many of the vendor’s systems continued to use the flawed software, allowing the threat actor to exploit them. Fortunately, a proactive response by us detected an attack on another vendor and effectively thwarted the attacker’s efforts.Upon further investigation, we discovered that the software vendor that developed the exploited software had previously fallen victim to Lazarus several times. This recurring breach suggested a persistent and determined threat actor with the likely objective of stealing valuable source code or tampering with the software supply chain, and they continued to exploit vulnerabilities in the company’s software while targeting other software makers.Infection timelineThe adversary demonstrated a high level of sophistication, employing advanced evasion techniques and introducing SIGNBT malware for victim control. In addition, other malware found in memory included Lazarus’ prominent LPEClient, a tool known for victim profiling and payload delivery that has previously been observed in attacks on defense contractors and the cryptocurrency industry.Executive summary:In mid-July 2023, we detected a series of attacks on several victims who had been targeted through legitimate security software designed to encrypt web communications using digital certificates. The exact method by which this software was exploited to deliver the malware remains elusive. However, we identified post-exploitation activity within the processes of the legitimate software. In one instance, while examining the memory of the compromised security software from a victim’s system, we discovered the presence of the SIGNBT malware accompanied by a shellcode. This shellcode was responsible for launching a Windows executable file directly in memory.The actor uses various tactics to establish and maintain persistence on compromised systems. These include the creation of a file called ualapi.dll in the system folder, which is automatically loaded by the spoolsv.exe process at each system boot. Additionally, in several instances, registry entries were recorded to execute legitimate files for the purpose of malicious side-loading, further ensuring a resilient persistence mechanism.Methods for loading the final payloadThe loader process retrieves the first 32 bytes from tw-100a-a00-e14d9.tmp and uses this data as an AES decryption key to decrypt the remaining contents. Once decrypted, the payload, a Windows executable identified as SIGNBT, is loaded directly into memory. In this case, the loaded payload also reads the configuration file from the same path, but with a slightly different file name.Inside this file is a base64-encoded string, mirroring the approach used in the previous SIGNBT malware method. The first 32 characters of this string serve as the AES decryption key, while the subsequent data contains configuration information used by the malware. This decrypted configuration data includes details such as three C2 addresses, which are referred to as proxies, sleep intervals, version information, monitored targets, and various other parameters critical to the malware’s operation.The majority of SIGNBT malware instances are launched through the malware loader, which operates exclusively in memory. Upon execution, the malware begins communicating with the C2 server by sending a beacon after initialization of its configuration data. In its C2 communication, the malware uses distinctive strings that start with SIGNBT. This unique characteristic has earned it the designation of SIGNBT. In addition, the malware uses different prefixes at each stage of its C2 operation to verify and maintain its activities.The malware employs a multi-step process to create a 24-byte value for various purposes. First, it generates this value with the following components:After creating this 24-byte value, the malware generates an additional 24 bytes of random data. These two sets of 24 bytes are then XORed together using another randomly generated 24-byte key. Subsequently, both the resulting value and the 24-byte key are encoded with base64. Finally, these encoded values are combined with either three or seven randomly generated HTTP parameter names. In all future C2 communications, the malware uses a similar structure, making it more challenging to detect and analyze its communications.Structure of HTTP POST dataThe malware uses a mechanism to validate the response data received from the C2 server. Specifically, it checks to see if the response data contains a hard-coded HTML script.\nDuring the validation process, the malware decodes the first 12 bytes from the C2 server using base64, replacing the spaces with plus signs to create a seven-character string. This process is then repeated with the next 12 bytes. The first seven characters from each set are then XORed and compared to the “success” string. This repetitive procedure is applied to every HTTP communication sequence to verify that the response aligns with the expected “success” criterion.Next, the malware sends HTTP requests with the SIGNBTKE header, and if it receives a “success” message from the C2 server, it activates the getInfo function within the CCBrush class. This function gathers various information about the victim’s computer, such as computer name, product name, OS details, system uptime, CPU information, system locale, time zone, network status, and malware configuration data. After sending this system-specific information, the malware sends another HTTP request with the SIGNBTGC prefix, this time using a randomly chosen embedded HTTP parameter from a list of 100 possible parameter names.\nThe data received from the C2 server is decrypted using AES with a decryption key obtained from a SIGNBTLG HTTP request. If the decrypted data is “keep”, the malware responds with an “OK” message using the SIGNBTSR prefix, indicating a successful communication. If there are problems, the malware uses the SIGNBTFI prefix to convey the nature of the problem or failure in communication. To summarize, the C2 communication process can be described as follows:C2 communication processIf the delivered data does not equal “keep”, indicating that specific instructions or actions are required, the malware proceeds to invoke the corresponding class and function for backdoor behavior. The SIGNBT malware is equipped with an extensive set of functionalities designed to exert control over the victim’s system. To perform these functions, the malware receives instructions from the C2 server in the form of a class name, function name, and any necessary parameters. It then executes the relevant function embedded in the malware’s codebase.The name of each backdoor command is straightforward, implementing commonly used Windows commands such as ping, netstat, and systeminfo. It’s important to note that the backdoor is capable of implanting an additional payload for auto execution, internally named “deploy”. This backdoor function receives file paths via command-line arguments decrypted with AES. Using this command, SIGNBT has been observed to implant the phantom DLL we already described in the SIGNBT loader section above.Based on the analysis, it is evident that the actor’s initial compromise of the victim involved exploiting vulnerabilities within the software exploit. They then proceeded to deploy the SIGNBT malware using a DLL side-loading technique. Furthermore, the actor used the backdoor capability “deploy” to implant an additional payload for automated execution. This multifaceted attack demonstrates a high level of sophistication and a deliberate effort to infiltrate and maintain control over the victim’s system.Using the comprehensive backdoor as described above, the actor deploys additional malware in the victim’s memory. Notably, these newly delivered malware variants predominantly execute in the system’s memory only, without touching the disk. Based on our telemetry, the actor has been observed to deliver such tools as LPEClient and credential dumping utilities to the victim machines.Additional payload delivered by SIGNBTThe infection chains of the three campaigns attributed to Lazarus in 2023The Lazarus group remains a highly active and versatile threat actor in today’s cybersecurity landscape. The threat actor has demonstrated a profound understanding of IT environments, refining their tactics to include exploiting vulnerabilities in high-profile software. This approach allows them to efficiently spread their malware once initial infections are achieved. Moreover, the activities of this notorious actor transcend geographic boundaries and industry sectors. They have targeted various industries, each with distinct objectives and using different tools, tactics and techniques. This underscores their recent and ongoing activity characterized by sophisticated methods and unwavering motivations.SIGNBT loader\n9cd90dff2d9d56654dbecdcd409e1ef3         %system%\\ualapi.dll\n88a96f8730b35c7406d57f23bbba734d        %system%\\ualapi.dll\n54df2984e833ba2854de670cce43b823       %system%\\ualapi.dll\nAe00b0f490b122ebab614d98bb2361f7          %system%\\ualapi.dll\ne6fa116ef2705ecf9677021e5e2f691e\n31af3e7fff79bc48a99b8679ea74b589           C:\\GoogleD\\Coding\\JS\\Node\\winhttp.dllSIGNBT\n9b62352851c9f82157d1d7fcafeb49d3LPEClient\n3a77b5054c36e6812f07366fb70b007d       %systme%\\wbem\\wbemcomn.dll\nE89fa6345d06da32f9c8786b65111928 %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ServiceSetting\\ESENT.dllFile path\nC:\\GoogleD\\Coding\\JS\\Node\\SgrmLpac.exe\nC:\\GoogleD\\Coding\\JS\\Node\\winhttp.dll\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\appdata\\Local\\tw-100a-a00-e14d9.tmp\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\appdata\\Local\\tw-100b-a00-e14d9.tmp\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.008.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.009.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.001.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.002.dat\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ServiceSetting\\ESENT.dllC2 servers\nhxxp://ictm[.]or[.]kr/UPLOAD_file/board/free/edit/index[.]php\nhxxp://samwoosystem[.]co[.]kr/board/list/write[.]asp\nhxxp://theorigin[.]co[.]kr:443/admin/management/index[.]php\nhxxp://ucware[.]net/skins/PHPMailer-master/index[.]php\nhxxp://www[.]friendmc[.]com/upload/board/asp20062107[.]asp\nhxxp://www[.]hankooktop[.]com/ko/company/info[.]asp\nhxxp://www[.]khmcpharm[.]com/Lib/Modules/HtmlEditor/Util/read[.]cer\nhxxp://www[.]vietjetairkorea[.]com/INFO/info[.]asp\nhxxp://yoohannet[.]kr/min/tmp/process/proc[.]php\nhxxps://admin[.]esangedu[.]kr/XPaySample/submit[.]php\nhxxps://api[.]shw[.]kr/login_admin/member/login_fail[.]php\nhxxps://hicar[.]kalo[.]kr/data/rental/Coupon/include/inc[.]asp\nhxxps://hspje[.]com:80/menu6/teacher_qna[.]asp\nhxxps://kscmfs[.]or[.]kr/member/handle/log_proc[.]php\nhxxps://kstr[.]radiology[.]or[.]kr/upload/schedule/29431_1687715624[.]inc\nhxxps://little-pet[.]com/web/board/skin/default/read[.]php\nhxxps://mainbiz[.]or[.]kr/SmartEditor2/photo_uploader/popup/edit[.]asp\nhxxps://mainbiz[.]or[.]kr/include/common[.]asp\nhxxps://new-q-cells[.]com/upload/newsletter/cn/frame[.]php\nhxxps://pediatrics[.]or[.]kr/PubReader/build_css[.]php\nhxxps://pms[.]nninc[.]co[.]kr/app/content/board/inc_list[.]asp\nhxxps://safemotors[.]co[.]kr/daumeditor/pages/template/template[.]asp\nhxxps://swt-keystonevalve[.]com/data/editor/index[.]php\nhxxps://vnfmal2022[.]com/niabbs5/upload/gongji/index[.]php\nhxxps://warevalley[.]com/en/common/include/page_tab[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]blastedlevels[.]com/levels4SqR8/measure[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]droof[.]kr/Board/htmlEdit/PopupWin/Editor[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]friendmc[.]com:80/upload/board/asp20062107[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]hanlasangjo[.]com/editor/pages/page[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]happinesscc[.]com/mobile/include/func[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]healthpro[.]or[.]kr/upload/naver_editor/subview/view[.]inc\nhxxps://www[.]medric[.]or[.]kr/Controls/Board/certificate[.]cer\nhxxps://www[.]muijae[.]com/daumeditor/pages/template/simple[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]muijae[.]com/daumeditor/pages/template/template[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]nonstopexpress[.]com/community/include/index[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]seoulanesthesia[.]or[.]kr/mail/mail_211230[.]html\nhxxps://www[.]seouldementia[.]or[.]kr/_manage/inc/bbs/jiyeuk1_ok[.]asp\nhxxps://www[.]siriuskorea[.]co[.]kr/mall/community/bbs_read[.]asp\nhxxps://yoohannet[.]kr/min/tmp/process/proc[.]phpAuthorsA cascade of compromise: unveiling Lazarus’ new campaignYour email address will not be published.

      "text": " The North Korean Lazarus hacking group repeatedly compromised a software vendor using flaws in vulnerable software despite multiple patches and warnings being made available by the developer.The fact that Lazarus breached the same victim multiple times indicates that the hackers aimed to steal source code or attempt a supply chain attack.\"This recurring breach suggested a persistent and determined threat actor with the likely objective of stealing valuable source code or tampering with the software supply chain, and they continued to exploit vulnerabilities in the company's software while targeting other software makers,\" explains Kaspersky.The attack was discovered by Kaspersky in July 2023, which observed Lazarus employing a diverse infection chain and post-compromise toolset.Kaspersky places this attack within the broader scope of a campaign in which Lazarus targeted various software vendors between March 2023 and August 2023.The report mentions that Lazarus targeted legitimate security software used for the encryption of web communications. However, the exact exploitation method the hackers followed remains unknown.The exploitation led to the deployment of the SIGNBT malware along with shellcode used for injecting the payload into memory for stealthy execution.Persistence is established by adding a malicious DLL ('ualapi.dll') onto Startup to be executed by 'spoolsv.exe,' or performing Windows Registry modifications.The malicious DLL file performs victim ID verification checks before it decrypts and loads the SIGNBT payload from a local filesystem path to ensure the infection proceeds onto the intended targets.SIGNBT gets its name from the distinct strings it uses for command and control (C2) communications, sending information about the compromised system and receiving commands for execution.The commands supported by SIGNBT are:SIGNBT can also fetch additional payloads from the C2 and deploy them on the host, providing Lazarus with operational versatility.Kaspersky has seen Lazarus leverage that feature on SIGNBT to load credential dumping tools and the LPEClient malware on compromised systems.LPEClient is an info-stealer and malware loader on itself, which, in its latest versions, Kaspersky says demonstrates significant evolution compared to previously documented samples.Kaspersky says Lazarus incorporates the LPEClient on other campaigns it ran in 2023, albeit it used the malware at earlier infection phases to inject other payloads.Overall, the Lazarus group remains one of the most active and dangerous threat actors, maintaining a broad targeting scope across regions and industries.Their recent actions underscore their sophisticated tactics and persistent goals, emphasizing organizations' need to proactively patch software and prevent easy exploitation of vulnerabilities for initial compromise."

      "text": " A new ransomware-as-a-service brand named Hunters International has emerged using code used by the Hive ransomware operation, leading to the valid assumption that the old gang has resumed activity under a different flag.This theory is supported by analysis of the new encryptor revealing multiple code overlaps between the two ransomware gangs.Security researchers analyzing a sample of the Hunters International malware discovered a striking resemblance to the code used in Hive ransomware attacks.Looking closer at the Hunters International sample, the researcher discovered code overlaps and similarities that match more than 60% of the code in Hive ransomware.However, the Hunters International group is denying the researchers’ “allegations” saying that they are a new service on the ransomware scene who purchased the encryptor source code from the Hive developers.“All of the Hive source codes were sold including the website and old Golang and C versions and we are those who purchased them,” the Hunters International gang says.Hive International claims that Hive’s code contained “a lot of mistakes that caused unavailability for decryption in some cases” but they fixed it.Furthermore, the new gang says that encryption is not the main goal of their operation, instead focusing on stealing data as leverage when extorting victims into paying a ransom demand.From analysis by BleepingComputer, Hunters International's encryptor appends the “.LOCKED” extension to the processed files.The malware leaves in each directory a plaintext file named \"Contact Us.txt\" with instructions for the victim to contact the attacker over Tor, through a chat page that is protected by a login specific for each victim.At the moment, their data leak site lists only one victim, a school in the UK, from where the attackers claim to have stolen almost 50,000 files consisting of data about students and teachers along with network and web credentials.It remains to be seen what fate awaits Hunters International's but with one victim published on their data leak site, the group does not appear to be too active.Whether Hive ransomware sold the source code to other cybercriminals or not, remains unknown at the moment but the gang's operations came to a sudden stop after its Tor payment and data leak site were seized in an international operation in January.According to the FBI, the gang breached more than 1,300 companies and recived ransom payments of about $100 million.The agency's activity allowed it to provide more than 1,300 decryption keys to Hive ransomware victims that had been encrypted before and after the FBI gained access to the attacker's environments."

Each of the resellers had between 300 and 2,500 customers, who paid them an annual subscription to access the illegal broadcast.The arrests were made in Vienna, Lower Austria, Salzburg, Vorarlberg, and Tyrol, with the following items seized during the law enforcement operation:\"Some of the illegally earned money was used for legal investments and thus introduced the suppliers into the higher economic cycle.\"The arrested individuals have pleaded guilty to commercial fraud, money laundering, the Access Control Act, and provisions of the Copyright Act.The remaining members of the crime group are in Germany, where the center of the illegal operations was located, but the authorities there have yet to begin civil proceedings."

      "text": " The Clark County School District (CCSD) in Nevada is dealing with a potentially massive data breach, as hackers email parents their children's' data that was allegedly stolen during a recent cyberattack.CCSD is the fifth largest school district in the US, with over 300,000 students and 15,000 teachers.On October 16, CCSD confirmed it suffered a cyberattack earlier this month, stating threat actors gained access to the district's email servers.\"Upon discovering the incident, CCSD immediately engaged a team of forensic experts to investigate the incident and ensure that CCSD operates within a safe and remediated email environment. CCSD is also cooperating with law enforcement's investigation.\"\"Thus far, the investigation revealed that the unauthorized party accessed limited personal information related to a subset of students, parents, and employees. CCSD is working diligently to identify all individuals whose information was impacted by this incident.\"In response to the attack, CCSD disabled access to its Google Workspace from external accounts and has forced reset all student's passwords.Since then, things have taken a turn for the worse, with parents reporting they are receiving emails from the threat actors warning that their child's data was leaked.\"There are over 200,000 student profiles like this which have been leaked now by the hackers. Be careful out there. Don't shoot the messenger!\"Both students and parents are upset and scared that the threat actor has their data and could potentially use it for other malicious purposes, such as identity theft or further phishing attacks.BleepingComputer contacted CCSD on Friday but did not receive a response as they were closed for the Nevada Day holiday.The threat actors contacted DataBreaches.net to share information about the attack, including a link to a \"statement\" that contains URLs for allegedly stolen data.\"We SingularityMD (the hack team), would like to make a statement for clarification. CCSD did not detect a security issue, we emailed them to tell them we had been in their network for a few months,\" reads a note by the hackers on a code-sharing site.\"For 6 years they forced students to use their birthday as their password, resetting the passwords back to their birth date each year, they even prevented the students from securing their accounts.\"\"We asked for less than one third of the Jesus F Jara's annual salary in exchange for destroying the stolen data. The callousness and incompetence of the leadership at CCSD is astounding, not only did they not cooperate, it is clear they did not communicate with principals and have still not plugged their leaky ship, meaning we still have access to the network.\"This note contains links to leaked data archives hosted on dark web and clearweb sites, containing what the hackers claim is the personal data of 200,000 students.This data allegedly contains student's emails, birth dates, ethnicity, PSAT scores, health information, suspensions, incident reports, and other information.The threat actors also leaked what they state are financial reports, staff salaries, and grant information from the district.However, parents who received some of the leaked data have already verified that the information belongs to their children, adding legitimacy to the leaks.At this time, the threat actors claim to still have access to CCSD's systems and have more data that they will leak if the school district does not pay an extortion demand.\"One final tip for CCSD, we will continue to cause trouble until you pay, or you finally kick us out of your network,\" concluded the threat actor's post.BleepingComputer has been unable to verify if the attacker's claims of still having access to CCSD systems are true.Furthermore, it should be noted that SingularityMD is not related to the AI platform under the same name."

Imperial Kitten, Tortoiseshell, TA456, Crimson Sandstorm). As reported in our previous Year in Retrospect publications,1,2,3 this threat actor remains an active and persistent threat to many industries and countries, including the maritime, shipping and logistics sectors within the Mediterranean; nuclear, aerospace and defence industries in the US and Europe; and IT managed service providers in the Middle East.In this blog we will cover a recently-observed sample of malware linked to Yellow Liderc that has been used alongside strategic web compromises. The following are the key points of our analysis:Yellow Liderc is an Iran-based threat actor that has been active since at least 2018. As previously reported in our 2020 Year in Retrospect publication, Yellow Liderc is an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp. (IRGC) aligned threat actor, which focuses on targeting  Aviation, Automotive, Aerospace and Defense, Logistics, Maritime and Information Technology organisations. Geographically, the threat actor focuses on targeting organsiations throughout the Middle East, Europe, both North and South America and parts of South Asia. In 2021, open source reporting documented alleged connections between the threat actor and the IRGC,4 which also aligns with our previous reporting.5Yellow Liderc is known for a variety of tactics and techniques, including phishing, social engineering and strategic web compromises. The threat actor uses both custom and off-the-shelf malware including PowerShell backdoors and infostealers in order to gather information about victim systems. The threat actor has previously used macro enabled documents that drop a VBS script, commonly referred to as LEMPO, which establishes persistence, performs reconnaissance, and exfiltrates sensitive information. The threat actor often favours exfiltration of sensitive information to an actor-controlled email account via SMTPS or IMAP, and has been observed using both dedicated mailboxes and third party services for their email accounts.78Since 2022 Yellow Liderc has frequently compromised legitimate websites and inserted malicious JavaScript,9,10,11 often referred to as a watering hole attack or strategic web compromise. The JavaScript is used by the threat actor to fingerprint website visitors by capturing user location, device, time of visits, etc. The script enables the actor to infect specific user systems, matching a target fingerprint, with malware and gain access to the organisation’s network.This activity has heavily focused on the maritime, shipping and logistics sectors within the Mediterranean. Previous open source reporting has described some of this specific targeting by the threat actor.12,13 PwC has observed the following domains being actively used by Yellow Liderc throughout 2022 and 2023 in various watering hole attacks:In some attacks, the threat actor would serve malware to their targets upon visiting the infected websites because their fingerprints apparently indicated they could be a high value target. PwC observed a new sample of malware used in those later stages, which we have named IMAPLoader. We assess that IMAPLoader is a replacement to a Python-based IMAP implant the actor used in late 2021 and early 2022.14 The overall functionality is similar to past malware leveraged by the threat actor, but IMAPLoader uses a new injection technique not previously seen with Yellow Liderc, and is detailed below.\r\n The following sample is a DLL written in .NET and acts as a downloader, leveraging email communication as a means of command and control (C2) communication.FilenameStreamingUX.dllSHA-256989373f2d295ba1b8750fee7cdc54820aa0cb42321cec269271f0020fa5ea006File typeWin32 DLLFile size175,104 bytesCreated2022-12-18 12:27:50Figure 1 – Overview of IMAPLoader’s functionalityIn order to run, IMAPLoader uses an injection technique known as ‘AppDomain Manager Injection’,15 which was first publicly disclosed in a proof of concept in 2020. The injection forces a Microsoft .NET application to load a specially crafted .NET assembly (IMAPLoader in this case). Upon execution, IMAPLoader extracts the full path to itself, and makes the Windows Console Window that is created when the application is started hidden from view. This is achieved by directly importing the Windows DLLs kernel32.dll and user32.dll and calling the GetConsoleWindow and ShowWindow APIs respectively.The malware then queries the IMAP accounts (email addresses) hardcoded in the DLL which are both decimal encoded. These include two email addresses and passwords, which once decoded, show Yandex email addresses, a common email provider used by this threat actor:The malware then runs a WMI query to determine the operating system version, followed by scheduling tasks depending on the version identified. One of those tasks is to check for specific mailbox folders in a folder misspelled by the threat actor. Messages in the \"Recive\" folder are likely to contain further payloads as attachments. IMAPLoader proceeds to compile a list of unseen messages in this folder and prepare for attachment extraction via the hard coded Yandex email addresses.Depending on which Yandex account successfully logged in to, a new object imapClient3 is created which can interact with the remote email. By calling WMI class Win32_ComputerSystemProduct, IMAPLoader extracts the system UUID strings. This is later converted into a SHA-256 hash value and the first 21 characters (converted to uppercase) are used as an identifier in any further communication with the IMAP account. This likely indicates the Yandex accounts are intended for use across multiple victims, in contrast to their previous Python-based IMAP implant.The briefly mentioned extraction of attachments uses the Ux.Attachment method to return a dictionary object, where the first entry is the name of the attachment (stored as a string), and the second entry stores the raw attached file as a byte object. The attachment is subsequently stored in the same location on disk as IMAPLoader. We also observed in the code that there is a persistence mechanism via Ux.EditTask. This method ensures persistence on the system for the new retrieved payload, which we assess is likely to be a PE executable file. The method is used to edit the Windows task (previously created by IMAPLoader as StreamingUX Updater [version number]) by updating the path to point to the new payload.In the last chain of actions, the new payload is executed, by calling the ProcessStartInfo class. Finally, a new thread is created in the context of IMAPLoader which is used to fingerprint the system and exfiltrate collected content by sending an email to the same IMAP account used to retrieve the payload. While we have previously observed the threat actor developing .NET malware which uses similar email-based C2 channels and hard-coded commands to gain information about the victim's environment, IMAPLoader is executed via the 'AppDomain Manager Injection' technique, a technique we have not observed Yellow Liderc using before, which shows an evolution of this threat actors tools and techniques.We detected another sample from September 2022 which we assess is an earlier version of IMAPLoader:FilenamesaveImapMessage.exeSHA-25632c40964f75c3e7b81596d421b5cefd0ac328e01370d0721d7bfac86a2e98827File typeWin32 EXEFile size170,496 bytesCreated2101-11-11 01:04:26PDB pathF:\\vsp\\saveImapMessage\\saveImapMessage\\obj\\Debug\\saveImapMessage.pdbAlthough saveImapMessage.exe is an EXE file rather than a DLL, this shares a similar .NET file structure. It also contains the same functionality as our original sample (StreamingUX.dll) which in this case is located in a namespace called ‘downloader’. We also found a .NET DLL named JobTitle.dll which shares a partial PDB path with saveImapMessage.exe (F:\\\\vsp\\) and drops a version of IMAPLoader to the victim’s system. The infection chain for IMAPLoader is composed of three stages, using a decoy Excel document and legitimate Microsoft application for injection as seen in Figure 3.\nFigure 3 - Infection chain to deliver and execute IMAPLoaderThe first stage is distributed as an Excel-DNA XLL plugin,17 an open source library that enables .NET integration into Microsoft Excel files. One of its resources is called JOBTITLE which stores the 2nd stage component of the multi-part infection chain.As soon as JobTitle.dll is executed, it writes a C# source code file named source.cs to disk. This is subsequently compiled into a .NET DLL file called sign.dll, a version of IMAPLoader, by leveraging the native C# compiler tool csc.exe.Three additional files extracted by JobTitle.dll from its resources are also written to disk: a benign Microsoft Excel document, a modified Microsoft Windows application and an associated configuration file.The last DLL has the same functionality as discussed in the earlier StreamingUX.dll IMAPLoader analysis. The email addresses used for C2 communication also match our earlier analysis indicating the threat actor has likely reused its infrastructure for different victims. As per the previous sample, host fingerprinting is performed at every new payload execution, by creating a new process and executing cmd.exe with the same parameters as before.Pivoting on the strategic web compromise infrastructure shows links to infrastructure we assess is likely used by Yellow Liderc in their phishing operations. For example, both ztransportorganizationil[.]xyz and officemicrosoftsign[.]com shared a resolution at IP 138.124.183[.]100. Many similar domains can be identified from additional pivots made on this threat actor's infrastructure that have been active since at least 2022, such as the one shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 – Phishing page hosted on cheapfortest[.]storeAll of this assessed phishing activity is likely aimed at a wider target audience, rather than solely focused on the maritime or shipping sectors within the Mediterranean. Some of the domains are generically themed around Microsoft accounts which can be used against a wide variety of targets, while other domains are specifically aimed at the travel and hospitality sectors within Europe. In some cases, the threat actor is likely credential harvesting based on observations of the phishing pages being served. For example, Figure 5 below, shows a generic Microsoft login page that Yellow Liderc is using to trick targets into entering their credentials. It is assessed that the likely delivery method of this and similar domains described throughout are sent via spear phishing emails. Figure 5 – Phishing page hosted on loginlive[.]formsmicrosoftoffice[.]com[.]oauth2[.]liveIn other cases, malware is served to targets upon visiting the phishing website. For example, the threat actor served a macro-enabled Excel document that drops a VBScript. The use of macro-enabled documents that drop VBScripts is very similar to past Yellow Liderc activity which we have reported on privately,18 alongside open source reporting.19\nFilenameincome_statement1.xlsmSHA-2561a996d98ab897bbc3a0249ea43afaf841b31396be7cbe61b443a58d1c9aab071File typeXLSMFile size3,122,078 bytesCreated2011-05-30 Figure 6 – Macro-enabled document served visiting phishing websitesUpon opening, the macro-enabled Excel document contains a custom message requesting the user to enable macros.

      "title": "Higaisa APT Resurfaces via Phishing Website targeting Chinese Users — Cyble",
      "text": " Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) discovered a phishing website named “open-vpn[.]top” on October 16th. This deceptive site is designed to imitate the legitimate OpenVPN website. It is suspected to be associated with a new campaign initiated by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group called Higaisa.Higaisa APT is believed to have South Korean origins and was initially disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence Center in early 2019. The group’s malicious activities can be traced back to at least 2016, involving the use of Trojans such as Gh0st and PlugX, as well as mobile malware. Their targets encompass government officials, human rights organizations, and other entities associated with North Korea.Phishing websites are frequently utilized by Threat Actors (TAs) as their primary method for distributing malware. These TAs frequently employ brand impersonation in their phishing campaigns, adeptly tricking users into a false sense of trust and legitimacy, ultimately enticing unsuspecting individuals. Given the widespread use of VPNs by individuals to overcome online censorship, it is conceivable that these TAs are specifically targeting those seeking to evade such restrictions. The image below depicts the fraudulent OpenVPN website.The website hosted a malicious OpenVPN installer file, which is bundled with a genuine OpenVPN executable and a malicious Rust-based executable. Notably, the Rust-based executable has a valid digital signature. This digital signature is attributed to the Chinese organization “Zhiya Yunke (Chengdu) Finance and Tax Service Co., Ltd.,” as shown below.We have obtained a file named “OpenVPN.exe” from the phishing website. This file is a 32-bit Graphical User Interface-based executable.Upon execution of the file, it initiates a prompt for the user to choose their desired language, as shown in the figure below. It displays an installation wizard to proceed with the installation process.During the installation, the installer drops several files in the “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OpenVPN” directory. These files consist of the genuine OpenVPN MSI installer (openvpn.msi), two legitimate runtime DLLs (vcruntime140.dll & vcruntime140Org.dll), and an additional malicious 64-bit console-based executable file written in the Rust programming language named “rom.exe,” which is a shellcode runner. Then, the installer file executes the malicious “rom.exe” file.The figure below shows the files dropped by the OpenVPN executable.When “rom.exe” is executed, the malware employs Windows APIs such as FindResource(), LoadResource(), and SizeofResource() to search for encrypted content stored within the executable’s resource section. Subsequently, it decrypts this content, which is a Shellcode and proceeds to execute it. The figure below shows the malware locating and executing the Shellcode.Upon execution, the Shellcode conducts an anti-debugging check by calculating a 32-bit hash of the current code section and subsequently comparing it to the original 32-bit hash of the code section. This check is designed to detect debugging attempts. When a debugger is in use, and a breakpoint is added, the debugger inserts the opcode “0xCC” at the location where the original opcode existed. This alteration to the opcode disrupts the original hash of the code section. If the hash does not match, the Shellcode terminates itself. The figure below shows the hash comparison.Subsequent to performing the anti-debugging operation, the malware proceeds secondary decryption of the Shellcode using a 16-byte XOR key and executes it, as shown in the figure below.After decryption, it creates a new thread with the purpose of generating a cryptographic session key. This key is intended to be sent to the C&C server to establish a secure communication channel.To generate the session key, the Shellcode initially utilizes the API function UUIDCreate(), which generates a 16-byte UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). This UUID will then be used for creating an AES encryption key. The code responsible for creating this UUID is depicted in the figure below.After generating the initial UUID, it proceeds to create an additional UUID. The last byte of the newly created UUID is typically used to generate a byte that will be used to compute a 32-bit hash using ROR and ADD-based instructions. This process is similar to the process used by shell code to compute hash at the time of anti-debugging operation. This hash is then passed to the CryptBinaryToStringA() API function for the purpose of generating Base64 encoded data using the second UUID, as shown in the figure below.The Shellcode employs the Windows Crypto API CryptCreateHash() to generate an MD5 hash using the first UUID. Subsequently, the Shellcode proceeds to create a second MD5 hash, this time of the previously generated hash. The figure below shows the routine for creating these hashes.Once the hashes are generated, the Shellcode proceeds to create a 128-bit AES encryption key using the CryptDeriveKey() function. The figure below shows the routine involved in creating this 128-bit AES key.The newly generated AES key is employed to enable encrypted communication with the C&C server. To establish a secure connection with the C&C server, the Shellcode utilizes a socket.Following the key initialization, the Shellcode initiates another thread, within which it establishes a socket connection and verifies the internet connectivity. To determine internet availability, the Shellcode evaluates connections to a predefined list of websites. If any of these websites can be reached, the Shellcode proceeds with additional operations. The figure below shows the routine containing hardcoded URLs.Following an internet connectivity check, the Shellcode initiates communication with the C&C server. To facilitate this communication, the Shellcode spawns additional threads. Specifically, it creates two additional threads that collaborate to manage the commands exchanged between the backdoor and the C&C server.The Shellcode creates a dispatch thread to handle the commands posted by the worker thread. The function of the dispatch thread is to create a message queue leveraging the PeekMessageW() API. Then, the worker thread proceeds to send the message ID alongside the command buffer to the message queue using the PostThreadMessageW() API.Once the dispatch thread receives a message from the worker thread, the message is then retrieved with the help of the GetMessageW() API.Based on the ID of the messages received, the command handler will accordingly receive the message. The figure below shows the dispatch thread.The shellcode is communicating to the IP 43.246.209[.]83 whose details are mentioned below:Upon establishing a successful connection with the C&C server, the attacker gains the ability to take control of the victim’s machine, perform malicious activities, and deploy additional malware, such as ransomware and others.CRIL also noticed three additional files engaged in communication with the C&C server, masquerading as GoogleMeet and ZoomInstaller.TAs often hide their malware payloads within genuine software installer files for various strategic reasons. This approach leverages the trust users have in legitimate software, increasing the likelihood of users willingly executing these files – believing them to be secure. Moreover, genuine software installers are frequently distributed through widely recognized channels, diminishing suspicion and boosting the chances of successful infiltration.In this case, TAs are concealing a shellcode runner within the legitimate OpenVPN software application. The analyzed Shellcode displays a high level of sophistication and presents a significant danger to unsuspecting users, largely due to the fact that the associated files possess valid digital signatures. This attribute significantly reduces the likelihood of detection at the time of writing this blog.Moreover, the manual nature of the malware’s operation suggests that the TAs are carefully selecting their targets for more precise and specific operations. This underscores the importance of user vigilance in light of the potential for further such attacks. Users should remain alert to the possibility of similar threats in the future.rule Higasia_APT{    meta:        author = “Cyble”        description = “Detects Higasia Loader”        date = “2023-10-26”        os = “Windows”        scan_type = “file”        severity = 90        reference_sample = “d329431aa23dba73214d1c104d01d57653fc59989a915337d1f92e6c7b56ac13”    strings:        $a = “MECHREVO”        $b = “\\\\shellcode_runner.pdb”        $c = “shellcode_runner\\\\”    condition:        uint16(0) == 0x5a4d and all of them}\n\t\t\t\tCyble Research Labs has discovered a new Android banking Trojan called Aberebot that targets banking customers of 140+ banks in 18 countries through phishing.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA phishing campaign from a Twitter post.
