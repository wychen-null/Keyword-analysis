      "title": "Graphiron: New Russian Information Stealing Malware Deployed Against Ukraine | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " The Nodaria espionage group (aka UAC-0056) is using a new piece of information stealing malware against targets in Ukraine. The malware (Infostealer.Graphiron) is written in Go and is designed to harvest a wide range of information from the infected computer, including system information, credentials, screenshots, and files.The earliest evidence of Graphiron dates from October 2022. It continued to be used until at least mid-January 2023 and it is reasonable to assume that it remains part of the Nodaria toolkit.Graphiron is a two-stage threat consisting of a downloader (Downloader.Graphiron) and a payload (Infostealer.Graphiron).The downloader contains hardcoded command-and-control (C&C) server addresses. When executed, it will check against a blacklist of malware analysis tools by checking for running processes with the names listed in Table 1.If no blacklisted processes are found, it will connect to a C&C server and download and decrypt the payload before adding it to autorun.The downloader is configured to run just once. If it fails to download and install the payload it won’t make further attempts nor send a heartbeat.Graphiron uses AES encryption with hardcoded keys. It creates temporary files with the \".lock\" and \".trash\" extensions. It uses hardcoded file names designed to masquerade as Microsoft office executables: OfficeTemplate.exe and MicrosoftOfficeDashboard.exeThe payload is capable of carrying out the following tasks:Password theft is carried out using the following PowerShell command:[void][Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault,Windows.Security.Credentials,ContentType=WindowsRuntime];$vault = New-Object Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault;$vault.RetrieveAll() | % { $_.RetrievePassword();$_} | Select UserName, Resource, Password | Format-Table –HideTableHeadersThe following command was used to export the list of PuTTY sessions:\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\reg.exe\" query HKCU\\Software\\SimonTatham\\Putty\\SessionsIn addition to this, as with earlier malware, Graphiron communicates with the C&C server using port 443 and communications are encrypted using the AES cipher.Nodaria has been active since at least March 2021 and appears to be mainly involved in targeting organizations in Ukraine. There is also limited evidence to suggest that the group has been involved in attacks on targets in Kyrgyzstan. Third-party reporting has also linked the group to attacks on Georgia.The group sprang to public attention when it was linked to the WhisperGate wiper attacks that hit multiple Ukrainian government computers and websites in January 2022. When WhisperGate was initially loaded onto a system, the malware would overwrite the portion of the hard drive responsible for launching the operating system when the machine is booted up with a ransom note demanding $10,000 in Bitcoin. However, this was just a decoy as the WhisperGate malware destroys data on an infected machine and it cannot be recovered, even if a ransom is paid.The group’s usual infection vector is spear-phishing emails, which are then used to deliver a range of payloads to targets. Custom tools used by the group to date include:Like Graphiron, many of Nodaria’s earlier tools were written in Go. Graphiron appears to be the latest piece of malware authored by the same developers, likely in response to a need for additional functionality. While GraphSteel and GrimPlant used Go version 1.16, Graphiron uses version 1.18, confirming it is a more recent development.While Nodaria was relatively unknown prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the group’s high-level activity over the past year suggests that it is now one of the key players in Russia’s ongoing cyber campaigns against Ukraine.If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file.SHA-256:0d0a675516f1ff9247f74df31e90f06b0fea160953e5e3bada5d1c8304cfbe63 — Downloader.Graphiron878450da2e44f5c89ce1af91479b9a9491fe45211fee312354dfe69e967622db — Downloader.Graphiron80e6a9079deffd6837363709f230f6ab3b2fe80af5ad30e46f6470a0c73e75a7 — Infostealer.Graphironeee1d29a425231d981efbc25b6d87fdb9ca9c0e4e3eb393472d5967f7649a1e6 — Infostealer.Graphironf0fd55b743a2e8f995820884e6e684f1150e7a6369712afe9edb57ffd09ad4c1 — Infostealer.Graphironf86db0c0880bb81dbfe5ea0b087c2d17fab7b8eefb6841d15916ae9442dd0cce — Infostealer.GraphironNetwork:208.67.104[.]95 — C&C serverThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.We encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform."

      "title": "Phishing Surges Ahead, as ChatGPT & AI Loom",
      "text": " Phishing is having a moment, with a massive spike in campaign volumes in the latter half of 2022. In fact, total phishing emails increased by 61% in the second half, according to an analysis this week. That could also be set to accelerate, as the rise of ChatGPT and other new tools are making their mark on the sector too. Malware volumes overall also increased, 12% quarter for quarter, with Vade detecting 58.9 million emails in the fourth quarter of 2022 that included malware, the researchers found.Email remains the top channel for distributing phishing and malware, giving hackers a convenient, scalable, and efficient vehicle for exploiting users and compromising accounts, Todd Stansfield, content marketing manager, noted in the report.\"Email threat activity continues to increase, creating the need for organizations of all sizes to fortify their cybersecurity,\" he wrote.Breaking down the numbers by the month, phishing volumes remained relatively stable through the first half of the fourth quarter, with 62.3 million phishing emails tracked in October and 47 million in November, according to the report.In terms of who they target and how they do it, phishing threat actors aren't getting especially creative given the current way enterprise users work and collaborate.Facebook remained the top brand in terms of impersonation for the second consecutive quarter, with researchers observing 6,700 unique phishing URLs impersonating the social networking giant in the fourth quarter of 2022, they reported. The company was followed by Microsoft, PayPal, Google, and Netflix in descending order as the brands that threat actors prefer to impersonate.\"With the growing popularity of productivity suites, users are increasingly using email to access and use productivity apps such as file sharing and instant messaging,\" Stansfield wrote, adding that threat actors have taken notice and are crafting phishing campaigns to target the specific behavior of corporate productivity-suite users.\"By purchasing a phishing kit, novice hackers can deploy highly convincing and effective schemes against their targets,\" Stansfield acknowledged.One recent enhancement to these kits is the ability to automatically localize phishing pages based on a victim's native language, a handy tool that allows threat actors to target various regions quickly without being multilingual themselves, the researchers said.The feature works by identifying the language settings of the targeted user's browser and leveraging it to update and display the phishing page accordingly. While improving the contextual accuracy of each phishing attack, the new feature also enables hackers to target users across multiple languages using a single kit, thus increasing the reach of their campaigns, according to Vade.Moreover, the problem with phishing is that it doesn't just end with an attacker giving up credentials, but ultimately, they can use these credentials as a way into corporate networks to steal data, distribute ransomware and other malware, and engage in other nefarious activity.Enterprises need to move beyond traditional email security solutions and adopt ones that can respond to the more sophisticated tactics of attackers, the researchers said. Specifically, collaborative and AI-enhanced solutions that can provide \"predictive defense against known and unknown threats using the latest threat intelligence and a core set of AI technologies,\" are the way forward, Stansfield said.\"On the flip side, we use AI to detect anomalies in email, from the content itself to the behavior of files that might be included in those emails,\" he says. \"There will be a battle between what you might call good and bad AI.\"If phishing emails do slip through an organization's security protections, training employees to identify phishing emails before they click on them can also be a reliable way to prevent credential or malware compromise before it occurs, Scott Caveza, senior research manager at cyber exposure management firm Tenable, tells Dark Reading.\"Phishing attacks continue to be successful as they target our weakest link in security, humans,\" he says. \"Regardless of the author of the email, be it AI or an actual human, organizations need to invest in and develop mature security programs where security awareness training, including specific training on spotting phishing attacks, are priorities for the organization.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A campaign operated by Russian threat actors uses fake job offers to target Eastern Europeans working in the cryptocurrency industry, aiming to infect them with a modified version of the Stealerium malware named 'Enigma.'The attacks start with an email pretending to be a job offer with fake cryptocurrency interviews to lure their targets. The emails have a RAR archive attachment which contains a TXT (\"interview questions.txt\") and an executable (\"interview conditions.word.exe\").The text file contains interview questions written in Cyrillic, which follow a standard format and are made to appear legitimate.If the victim is tricked into launching the executable, a chain of payloads is executed that eventually downloads the Enigma information-stealing malware from Telegram.The first-stage downloader is a C++ tool that uses techniques like API hashing, string encryption, and irrelevant code to evade detection while downloading and launching the second-stage payload, \"UpdateTask.dll.\"The second-stage payload, also written in C++, uses the \"Bring Your own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD) technique to exploit the CVE-2015-2291 Intel vulnerability. This Intel driver flaw allows commands to be executed with Kernel privileges.The threat actors abuse this vulnerability to disable Microsoft Defender before the malware downloads the third payload.The third-stage downloads the final payload, Enigma Stealer, from a private Telegram channel, which Trend Micro says is a modified version of Stealerium, an open-source information-stealing malware.Enigma targets system information, tokens, and passwords stored in web browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and more. Additionally, it targets data stored in Microsoft Outlook, Telegram, Signal, OpenVPN, and other apps.Enigma can also capture screenshots from the compromised system and extract clipboard content or VPN configurations.Finally, all stolen data is compressed in a ZIP archive (\"Data.zip\") and sent back to the threat actors via Telegram.Some of Enigma's strings, such as web browser paths and Geolocation API services URLs, are encrypted with the AES algorithm in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode, likely to conceal the data and prevent unauthorized access or tampering.Trend Micro has not assigned attribution with strong confidence but discovered several elements that may indicate a Russian threat actor is behind the attacks.The first clue is that one of the logging servers used in this campaign to track the execution flow of active infections hosts an Amadey C2 panel, which is quite popular in Russian cybercrime forums.Second, the server runs \"Deniska,\" a special-purpose Linux system only referenced in Russian-speaking forums.Finally, the server's default time zone is set to Moscow, another indicator that the threat actors are Russian."

As noted, the threat actors leverage SEO poisoning tactics to bring its infected pages to the top of internet browser search results to appear as legitimate sites.“SEO poisoning and Google service abuse, in general, have been documented a lot recently, which indicates this infection vector is becoming common for threat actors,” they added.The team “observed the deployment of Gootloader through heavily obfuscated JavaScript files with a file size of more than 40 Megabytes,” as well as the use of fake search engine ads linked to the infected piece of malware.The infections follow a similar flow: tricking a user into downloading the malware using the above tactics, prompting a ZIP file decompression that leads to the first- and second-stage payloads, and leading to a massive file meant to throw off security tools.Researchers note that most of the domains in the Gootloader PowerShell second stage script had one item in common: “/xmlrpc.php\" was displayed in relation to VirusTotal. The actors behind the variant commonly use compromised WordPress websites to use as C2 servers.After a Gootloader infection, the threat actor used “hands-on keyboard activities” that led to further deployment of attack frameworks, Cobalt Strike and SystemBC, “a proxy malware leveraging SOCKS5 and often used during the exfiltration phase of an attack.”The attacks have also used DLL Hijacking “on top of a VLC MediaPlayer executable.” These frameworks are used in both the infection and lateral movement stages of attacks.A successful infection would give a threat actor the ability to remotely control the victim’s device and gather system information, before launching into a “discovery process” to select the most interesting targets.

      "text": " North Korean state hackers are using a variety of ransomware strains to attack healthcare organizations and other targets globally, with the goal of pulling in money to fund other operations, the U.S. and South Korea said Thursday. Specific targets for those cyber operations include U.S. defense information networks and military contractors, according to joint advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI, the NSA and several South Korean defense and intelligence agencies.North Korean hackers have used both internally developed ransomware like Maui and H0lyGh0st, the agencies said, as well as other extortion malware attained by other means — such as Deadbolt, ech0raix, GonnaCry, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LockBit 2.0, My Little Ransomware, NxRansomware, Ryuk, and YourRansom.The agencies also said North Korean hackers have attempted to portray themselves as members of other ransomware groups like the now-shuttered REvil.They have generated multiple web domains, personas and accounts to obscure their actions, according to the agencies, which noted that the hackers are able to “procure infrastructure, IP addresses, and domains with cryptocurrency generated through illicit cybercrime, such as ransomware and cryptocurrency theft.”They also use VPNs to make it appear attacks are coming from more innocuous locations outside of North Korea. The hackers use a range of exploits for common vulnerabilities like Log4Shell and others. The agencies named three specific vulnerabilities – CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-20038 and CVE-2022-24990 – as ones typically used by North Korean actors. In addition to ransomware, the hackers use other customized malware to exfiltrate data, perform reconnaissance operations and steal files. “DPRK cyber actors have been observed setting ransoms in bitcoin. Actors are known to communicate with victims via Proton Mail email accounts,” the advisory said. “For private companies in the healthcare sector, actors may threaten to expose a company’s proprietary data to competitors if ransoms are not paid.”The advisory highlights a startling trend across the world as nation-states have begun deploying ransomware for a variety of reasons and purposes. Allan Liska, a ransomware expert at cybersecurity company Recorded Future, said more than 50 national governments or national government agencies have been hit by ransomware in 2022. The Record is an editorially independent unit of Recorded Future.“We’ve seen what appear to be government-backed ransomware attacks from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Now, North Korea has always used ransomware attacks, dating back to 2017, but they seem to have really stepped up their attacks this year, making them even more dangerous as an adversary,” he said. Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

The execution of malicious files mimics the process of scanning computers for viruses, making it potentially hard for victims to detect. Hackers also placed the malicious file on a fake website rather than in an email attachment to avoid detection, the report said.  CERT-UA said the payloads allowed hackers to take screenshots of the victim's computer, scan the desktop folder for files with the specified extensions, and exfiltrate user data.

However, the weak chips inside these devices call for an algorithm that can deliver robust encryption at very little computational power.\"These algorithms should cover most devices that have these sorts of resource constraints.\"ASCON was selected as the best of the 57 proposals submitted to NIST, several rounds of security analysis by leading cryptographers, implementation and benchmarking results, and feedback received during workshops. The whole program lasted for four years, having started in 2019.ASCON was eventually picked as the winner for being flexible, encompassing seven families, energy efficient, speedy on weak hardware, and having low overhead for short messages.NIST also considered that the algorithm had withstood the test of time, having been developed in 2014 by a team of cryptographers from Graz University of Technology, Infineon Technologies, Lamarr Security Research, and Radboud University, and winning the CAESAR cryptographic competition's \"lightweight encryption\" category in 2019.Two of ASCON's native features highlighted in NIST's announcement are AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) and hashing.AEAD is an encryption mode that provides confidentiality and authenticity for transmitted or stored data, combining symmetric encryption and MAC (message authentication code) to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.Hashing is a data integrity verification mechanism that creates a string of characters (hash) from unique inputs, allowing two data exchange points to validate that the encrypted message has not been tampered with.NIST still recommends the AES technique for AEAD and SHA-256 for hashing; however, these are unsuitable for smaller, weaker devices.Despite ASCON's lightweight nature, NIST says the scheme is powerful enough to offer some resistance to attacks from powerful quantum computers at its standard 128-bit nonce. However, this is not the goal or purpose of this standard, and lightweight cryptography algorithms should only be used for protecting ephemeral secrets."

      "text": "  Meta is again being called out for its dubious privacy practices, this time over allegations that “significant amounts of sensitive user data” was available for access to “hundreds of thousands of developers” from what Facebook classified as “high-risk jurisdictions,” like China and Russia.An audit of Meta’s privacy practices revealed “nearly 90,000 separate developers” in China and over 42,000 developers in Russia, and thousands of developers in other high-risk jurisdictions, including Iran and North Korea, had access to user information. The letter was sent after the company’s own investigation revealed the apparent data sharing. The internal audit was brought on after the Cambridge Analytica fallout in 2018, where a New York Times report found Facebook handed privileged API access to Huawei, OPPO, TCL, and other China-backed device makers for at least eight years.The Times report confirmed the “device manufacturers were permitted to access a wealth of information on Facebook’s users, including profile data, user IDs, photos, as well as contact information and even private messages.” The news prompted a host of lawsuits.“We were startled to learn recently, as a result of this ongoing litigation and discovery, that Facebook had concluded that a much wider range of foreign-based developers, in addition to the PRC-based device-makers, also had access to this data,” the senators wrote.In fact, Facebook’s own internal materials warned that the high-risk jurisdictions “may be governed by potentially risky data storage and disclosure rules or be more likely to house malicious actors,” including “states known to collect data for intelligence targeting and cyber espionage,” the letter continues.Warner and Rubio have “grave concerns about the extent to which this access could have enabled foreign intelligence service activity, ranging from foreign malign influence to targeting and counterintelligence activity.”Based on the unsealed documents that showed Facebook performed separate reviews on the risky developers, Zuckerberg is asked to explain the review process and conclusions, the precise percentage of the developers located in China and Russia, and “what communications, if any, has Facebook had with these developers since its initial identification.”The senators asked for logs into the frequency of the data sharing, as well as the criteria used to evaluate risk associated with operating in those countries, the exact information they had access to, and for how long. Zuckerberg is also asked to estimate just how many users were impacted this time around.Meta has consistently been in the hot seat over its data practices even before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, particularly over its handling of health data.In October, Warner issued another letter to Zuckerberg demanding: “Where required by law, does Meta always comply with any and all notification requirements when the Meta Pixel handles or transmits protected information, in the manner and time required by such laws?”The company is currently defending itself against well over 1,000 lawsuits, more than a dozen of which are tied to the Pixel tracking tool alone. But with $480.21 billion in market capital, it’s unclear just what impact, if any, these measures will incur.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Security researchers have discovered four malicious Dota 2 game modes that were used by a threat actor to backdoor the players' systems.\"These game modes were named Overdog no annoying heroes (id 2776998052), Custom Hero Brawl (id 2780728794), and Overthrow RTZ Edition X10 XP (id 2780559339),\" Avast malware researcher Jan Vojtěšek said.The attacker also included a new file named evil.lua that was used to test server-side Lua execution capabilities. This malicious snippet could be used for logging, executing arbitrary system commands, creating coroutines, and making HTTP GET requests.The backdoor enabled the threat actor to remotely execute commands on the infected devices, potentially allowing the installation of further malware on the device.​\"This backdoor permits the execution of any JavaScript acquired through HTTP, providing the attacker the power to both conceal and modify the exploit code at their discretion without undergoing the game mode verification process, which can be dangerous, and updating the entire custom game mode,\" Vojtěšek said.On players' compromised systems, the backdoor was also used to download a Chrome exploit known to be abused in the wild.\"Since V8 was not sandboxed in Dota, the exploit on its own allowed for remote code execution against other Dota players,\" Vojtěšek added.The JavaScript exploit for CVE-2021-38003 was injected in a legitimate file that added scoreboard functionality to the game likely to make it harder to detect.Valve also took down the malicious game modes and alerted all players impacted by the attack.\"One way or another, we can say that this attack was not very large in scale. According to Valve, under 200 players were affected,\" Vojtěšek added.The cheat dev removed the features in a new version on January 21 and apologized for the chaos caused by the cheat's users. "

      "title": "Toyota Global Supply Chain Portal Flaw Put Hacker in the Driver's Seat",
      "text": " [This article was updated on 2/13/2023 with an update from the researcher's report stating that the Toyota portal was created and is maintained by the automaker.]An ethical hacker found a backdoor in a Web app used by Toyota employees and suppliers for coordinating tasks related to the automaker's global supply chain, gaining control of the global system merely by knowing the email address of one of its users.Once acting as an administrator, Zveare said he had \"full access\" to internal Toyota projects, documents, and user accounts, including some of those that belonged to Toyota external partners and suppliers such as Michelin, Continental, Stanley Black & Decker, and Harman.All in all, the researcher gained read/write access to Toyota's global user directory of more than 14,000 users. Zveare also could access corporate user account details, confidential documents, projects, supplier rankings/comments, and other sensitive data related to those users, he said.Indeed, had a threat actor discovered the issue before him, \"the consequences could have been severe,\" Zveare observed.The issue could have allowed attackers to create their own user account with an elevated role to retain access should the issue ever be discovered and fixed, or download and leak all the data to which they had access, he said.They also could have deleted or modified data in a way to be disruptive to global Toyota operations, or crafted a highly targeted phishing campaign to attempt to capture \"real corporate login details, which could have exposed other Toyota systems to attacks,\" Zveare wrote.The researcher reported the issue to Toyota on Nov. 3 and the company reported back 20 days later that it had been fixed — a speedy response with which Zveare was \"impressed,\" he said.\"Out of all the security issues I have reported so far to various vendors, Toyota’s response was the fastest and most effective,\" he said.Fortunately for Toyota, the latest breach was an ethical one and, thanks to Zveare's responsible disclosure, the company could fix it before there was any impact on the company or its partners' business, notes one security professional.However, the GSPIMS API appeared to be secure, which inspired Zveare to further dig into the application code to see what else might be cooking. What he eventually found was that JSON Web Tokens — or session tokens representing the users' valid authenticated sessions on the website — were being generated based on a user's email without requiring a password.Zveare Googled for Toyota supply chain users and made an educated guess to formulate the email of someone who he thought would be a user of the GSPIMS portal. \"Then I fired off the createJWT HTTP request, and it returned a valid JWT!\" he wrote.His discovery gave him the ability to generate a valid JWT for any Toyota employee or supplier registered in GSPIMS, \"completely bypassing the various corporate login flows, which probably also enforce two-factor authentication options,\" Zveare wrote.Though the user whose email he accessed the system with did not have system administrator privileges, he eventually searched within the GSPIMS to find the email of someone who did, and using that he gained full control of the system as an administrator.Enterprises have work to do to in order to block the issue Zveare found, security experts say. For starters, security administrators must take a more holistic approach to security and realize the wider impact their overall security posture — or lack thereof — can have on all of the partners and customers with whom they do business.\"What are perceived as 'internal systems' to organizations, no longer are,\" Dror Liwer, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Coro said in an email statement to Dark Reading. \"With partners, suppliers, and employees collaborating via the Internet — all systems should be considered external, and as such, protected against malicious intrusion.\"Developing this big-picture perspective and security strategy is not so simple, as most enterprises already have their hands full managing their own company's risk, notes Lorri Janssen-Anessi, director of external cyber assessments for BlueVoyant.However, considering how easy it was for Zveare to gain access to a system that serves Toyota's global supply chain, companies need to get their heads around this risk to maintain security across any third party that touches their network, she says.\"What today's organizations should take from the reported vulnerability in Toyota's supplier management network is a firm reminder to look at their own vendor and supplier cybersecurity,\" Janssen-Anessi says.Among the key measures to consider include shoring up access control and user account privileges, ensuring that they only provide employees and third-parties with access to the data needed for their particular role, she notes. \"This helps to control what data can be accessed in the event of a breach,\" Janssen-Anessi says.Indeed, a more data-centric approach overall to security could help enterprises avoid or mitigate a scenario that Zveare demonstrated, Comforte AG's Horst observes. He advises that organizations find ways to protect data as soon as it enters their corporate data ecosystem, thus protecting \"the data itself rather than perimeters and borders around the data.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Google has announced the release of the first developer preview for Android 14, the next major version of the world's most popular mobile operating system, which comes with security and privacy enhancements, among other things.Starting with Android 14, apps will have to declare precisely how they plan to use certain phone features, data exchange between them will be limited, and additional files downloaded by apps will be read-only.A highlighted security feature in Android 14 is to block the installation of malicious apps that target older API levels (Android versions), which allows easier abuse of sensitive permissions.Starting with the \"Runtime receivers,\" which enable apps to receive intents broadcast by the system or other applications, all apps targeting Android 14 must declare if they need to receive information from other apps or if they should be limited to system \"broadcasts.\"This new security measure continues the \"Context.registerReceiver()\" feature introduced in previous Android releases. It aims to prevent malicious apps on the device from intercepting or misusing broadcasts meant to reach other apps.To further tighten up the information exchange between apps and prevent malware from gripping sensitive user data, Android 14 will also restrict the sending of \"intents\" that don't have a specified recipient.With this new security enhancement, malware can no longer intercept intents sent from other apps and read their contents.The third security feature that will land on Android 14 is \"safer dynamic code loading,\" which limits all files downloaded by an application to read-only mode.This would help prevent some code-injection scenarios involving manipulated executables that are meant to be run by privileged apps.Finally, Android 14 will block the installation of harmful apps that target SDK versions lower than 23 (Android 6.0) to achieve easier permissions abuse.\"Malware often targets older API levels to bypass security and privacy protections that have been introduced in newer Android versions,\" explains Google.\"To protect against this, starting with Android 14, apps with a targetSdkVersion lower than 23 cannot be installed.\"In Android 6.0 (2015), Google introduced a runtime permission model that required apps to request the user to grant permission access requests for sensitive operations like the device's camera, microphone, GPS sensors, phone calls, and SMS access upon the app's launch.Malware targeting previous SDK versions can specify it in the manifest XML file and request access to sensitive permissions upon installation, which is easier for users to overlook and approve.The new permissions protection system will also make it impossible for users to install apps that haven't been updated for some time. However, Google says older apps already installed on devices that upgrade to Android 14 will continue to work.Android 14 is still far from its final form, and we may see more security features land on the second developer preview in March 2023."

However, when the list got quickly populated with more addresses, it became clear that the app's server was leaking sensitive information.Trustwave reported the issue to the publisher of Money Lover, Finsify, who released a fixing update on January 27, 2023.The report did not clarify when the flaw was discovered or how long Money Lover users remained exposed.It is essential to clarify that the information disclosure bug only impacted users who used the shared wallet feature.The main repercussion of this flaw is that an attacker accessing email addresses and transaction metadata could perform targeted phishing attacks against the exposed users to gain access to further sensitive information.Money Lover users are recommended to update their app to the latest available version using their operating system's app store."

      "title": "CISA says Killnet DDoS attacks on U.S. hospitals had little effect",
      "text": " The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it helped dozens of hospitals respond to a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incidents last week that were launched by a pro-Kremlin hacking group.A spokesperson for CISA told The Record that several of the incidents temporarily reduced the availability of the hospitals’ public-facing websites, but there were no reports of unauthorized access to hospital networks, disruption to health care delivery or impacts on patient safety.On their popular Telegram channel, the hackers boasted of launching DDoS attacks on hospitals in more than 25 states. Less than half of the attacks — which involved routing a deluge of page requests at hospital websites — were successful in knocking websites offline, CISA said. The agency said DDoS incidents have become a priority issue. The spokesperson added that for much of the past year, CISA has been helping organizations mitigate DDoS attacks, particularly those launched by Killnet. The agency also worked with several tech companies to provide free resources to under-funded organizations that can help them reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. CISA plans to continue working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to communicate with hospitals about government assistance and third-party services.Cybersecurity firm Cloudflare said hospitals have reached out in recent days looking for help in addressing Killnet’s DDoS campaign. Cloudflare experts said the attacks are not originating from a single botnet — a group of Internet-connected devices taken over by hackers and used to amplify DDoS attacks. Omer Yoachimik, product manager at Cloudflare, told The Record that attacks have come in several waves over the last week and so far have been relatively small, in the range of the range of 10,000 to 100,000 HTTP requests per second (rps). The largest attack on a hospital reached 1.6 million rps, with the peak lasting less than 10 seconds and the entire attack taking about six minutes. Cloudflare did not name the hospital.“That’s a large attack that would degrade services and affect application usability,” he said, adding that most sites would not be able to withstand that without a DDoS protection service.Yoachimik explained that their research into the DDoS campaign indicates that the attacks are being crowdsourced – meaning Killnet operators are reaching out to other groups and individuals that are either using multiple botnets or different attack methods. “It is likely that pro-Russian ransomware groups or operators, such as those from the defunct Conti group, will heed Killnet’s call and provide support. This likely will result in entities Killnet targeted also being hit with ransomware or DDoS attacks as a means of extortion, a tactic several ransomware groups have used,” HHS warned. Akamai’s Patrick Sullivan said attacks on Eastern Europe have skyrocketed from 1% to as high as 30% of all observed attacks on its DDoS platform in 2022.“There has been a surge in politically motivated DDoS attacks in the past year due to heightened geopolitical tensions,” he said. “Threat actors have targeted a variety of sectors, including government institutions and private companies, across Western Europe, in addition to US healthcare organizations most recently.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " The first Linux variant of the Clop ransomware was rife with issues that allowed researchers to create a decryptor tool for victims.Terefos explained that the new Linux variant was mostly used to target educational institutions – including a university in Colombia – but had issues that defenders could exploit to help victims. “We discovered a flaw in the Linux version of Clop ransomware which enabled us to create a decryptor tool. We have not seen any new versions of the ransomware in the wild. However, we predict that the ransomware authors will likely attempt to fix the flaw in future versions, so organizations should take steps to protect themselves against the ransomware,” Terefos said. “We found that the Linux version of the Cl0p ransomware is in an early stage of development, suggesting that the threat actors are still manually operating and tweaking the ransomware to target specific victims. We also noticed that the ransomware had hardcoded victim-specific details, such as file paths for encryption, indicating that the threat actors had knowledge of the victim environment before launching the attack.”The researchers noted that the developers likely did not invest much time or resources into improving the obfuscation or evasiveness of the Linux version because many security systems could not detect it. The Windows version allowed the ransomware group to list out what folders and files should not be encrypted, but that functionality was not seen with the Linux version. The Linux version was used to target specific folders and all file types. “Rather than simply port the Windows version of Cl0p directly, the authors have chosen to build bespoke Linux payloads. We understand this to be the primary reason for the lack of feature parity between the new Linux version and the far more established Windows variant,” Terefos explained.“SentinelLabs expects future versions of the Linux variant to start eliminating those differences and for each updated functionality to be applied in both variants simultaneously.”The Linux version also leaves the ransom note in a .txt format while the Windows version leaves the ransom note in .rtf.In spite of the June 2021 arrests, Clop has not stopped operating and the development of a Linux version should prompt defenders to be ready for anything, Terefos said. “Ransomware groups are constantly seeking new targets and methods to maximize their profits. Being widely used in enterprise environments, Linux and cloud devices offer a rich pool of potential victims,” Terefos told The Record. “In recent years, many organizations have shifted towards cloud computing and virtualized environments, making Linux and cloud systems increasingly attractive targets for ransomware attacks. Therefore, ransomware groups targeting Linux and cloud systems is a natural progression in their quest for higher profits and easier targets.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  Tallahassee Memorial Health is continuing to divert some emergency care patients five days after a reported IT security issue, despite making progress in its recovery efforts.TMH has been “proactively working to solve” the incident with support from law enforcement, which has brought some of its care services back online. Notably, the health system canceled surgeries between Thursday and Monday, but is now “performing limited surgeries and procedures.”The networks for its labor and delivery facility, as well as its connected physician practices, are operational. However, clinicians are still leveraging paper processes for registration, admission, and during care, which is causing expected delays in care. “Our teams are working around the clock in collaboration with outside consultants to investigate the cause of the event and safely restore all computer systems as quickly as possible,” according to the latest notice. But as with most healthcare security incidents, recovery is often slow-going. For some of the largest health systems, EHR downtime can last up to four weeks.But all hospital services remained open, outside of its pharmacy, outpatient imaging, and pulmonary function testing services. A website notice shows imaging and walk-in lab services remain closed. The hospital has not provided an update outside of the initial report.A successful phishing attack against a Highmark employee in December potentially compromised the data of 300,000 patients.The notice shows an employee was sent an email with a malicious link, which compromised their email account for two days between Dec. 13 and Dec. 15. Upon discovery, Highmark immediately shut down the account, reset passwords, and implemented network blocking.However, the compromise enabled the threat actor to access emails within the account, some of which contained patient data.The data varied by patient and could include names and Social Security numbers, as well as enrollment information like group names, identification numbers, claims data, treatment information, dates of service, procedures, and prescription information. For some patients, financial information, contact details, and email addresses were also compromised.Highmark is continuing to bolster its email security controls, as it provides employees with further cyber and phishing training to help prevent future attempts.Sharp Healthcare is notifying 62,777 patients of a recent website hack that potentially compromised their protected health information. Sharp Health is a nonprofit healthcare group based in San Diego.On Dec. 12, a hack was detected on a server that supports the Sharp Health website. The IT team took the affected servers offline and launched incident response protocols. The forensics later determined the activity was tied to a threat actor accessing a website server for several hours, which led to the access of a single file containing patient data. The data varied by patient and could include patient ID numbers, invoice numbers, payment amounts, and provider names. No financial data or further identifiers were compromised during the incident. Sharp Health stressed that only patients “who paid a bill or invoice using the online bill payment service between Aug. 12, 2021, and Jan. 12, 2023” were affected.”The health group has since enhanced its website security tools and is continuing to monitor its “systems to proactively identify additional safeguards.”A network hack against Cardiovascular Associates led to the theft of data for 441,640 patients tied to its Alabama care sites.First discovered on Dec. 5, a threat actor gained access to “certain systems” within the CA network. After securing the impacted systems, an investigation was launched with support from an outside forensic firm. The forensic evidence revealed the access enabled the actor to copy some personal and health data from the network for a week between Nov. 28 and Dec. 5. The stolen information could include demographic details, SSNs, health insurance information, treatment information, medical record numbers, dates of service, provider names, diagnoses, health assessment information, tests and imaging, and billing and claims data. Some passports, driver’s licenses, credit and debit card information, and other financial account details were also affected.In response to this incident, Cardiovascular Associates has added further security and monitoring enhancements to minimize the risk of a recurrent incident.Regal Medical Group, Lakeside Medical Organization, ADOC Medical Group, and Greater Covina Medical in New York was hit with a ransomware attack on Dec. 8, which led to the exfiltration of data tied to over 3.3 million patients. It's the biggest healthcare data breach reported so far this year and impacts more patients than the third-largest incident reported in 2022.The health group is known collectively as Regal, and its notice shows the cyberattack began on Dec. 1 but went undetected for one week.After experiencing “difficulty in accessing some servers,” Regal performed an extensive review that found malware on some of its servers. The subsequent investigation later found the incident was caused by a threat actor accessing and exfiltrating data from its systems.A third-party team helped the medical group with its response to the incident, including restoring access to the systems and analyzing the impacted data. The stolen data could include names, SSNs for some patients, dates of birth, contact details, diagnoses, treatments, lab test results, prescriptions, radiology reports, and health plan numbers.Regal is providing all impacted patients with a year of free credit monitoring and has since bolstered its security and protocols.A network hack deployed against Howard Memorial Hospital in December led to the exfiltration of data tied to 53,668 patients. HMH detected the hack on Dec. 4 after the actor publicly claimed to have stolen patient data from its network.An investigation confirmed the allegations and determined the threat actor first gained access on Nov. 14. Upon discovery, HMH secured the network and performed a comprehensive review to identify the potentially stolen information.But “ultimately, HMH made the decision to notify all current or former patients and employees, in an abundance of caution, due to a potential impact to their information,” according to the notice. The data possibly accessed or stolen by the attacker could include SSNs, contact details, dates of birth, health insurance information, medical record numbers, medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and physician names.Update: This story was updated on Feb 10 to include the number of patients affected by the Regal incident, newly reported to the Department of Health and Human Services.Update 2: This story was updated on Feb. 21 to include the number of patients impacted by the Cardiovascular Associates incident as reported to HHS.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Okta had 4,961 current and former employees' data, including names, health insurance plan numbers, and Social Security numbers, compromised following a breach at its third-party vendor Rightway Healthcare, reports The Register.Threat actors using private keys and passphrases from LastPass databases stolen in cyberattacks last August and December were reported by ZachXBT and MetaMask developer Taylor Monahan to have been able to exfiltrate $4.4 million worth of cryptocurrency on Oct. 25, BleepingComputer reports.The three companies claim no sensitive customer data was lost despite being targeted after the breach of the identity and access management firm.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " A new QBot malware campaign dubbed \"QakNote\" has been observed in the wild since last week, using malicious Microsoft OneNote' .one' attachments to infect systems with the banking trojan.Qbot (aka QakBot) is a former banking trojan that evolved into malware that specializes in gaining initial access to devices, enabling threat actors to load additional malware on the compromised machines and perform data-stealing, ransomware, or other activities across an entire network.Threat actors can embed almost any file type when creating malicious OneNote documents, including VBS attachments or LNK files. These are then executed when a user double-clicks on the embedded attachment in a OneNote Notebook.However, it is necessary to introduce social engineering to convince users to click on a particular spot to launch the embedded attachment, usually done with a 'Double Click to View File' button or some other call to action, as shown below.Once launched, the embedded attachments can execute commands on the local machine to download and install malware.This switch in QBot's distribution was first publicly reported by Cynet's researcher Max Malyutin on Twitter on January 31, 2023.A script in the HTA file will use the legitimate curl.exe application to download a DLL file (the Qbot malware) to the C:\\ProgramData folder and is then executed using Rundll32.exe.The QBot payload injects itself into the Windows Assistive Technology manager (“AtBroker.exe”) to conceal its presence and evade detection from AV tools running on the device.Sophos reports that QBot’s operators employ two distribution methods for these HTA files: one that sends emails with an embedded link to the weaponized .one file and one where the “thread injections” method is used.The latter is a particularly tricky technique where the QBot operators hijack existing email threads and send a “reply-to-all” message to its participants with a malicious OneNote Notebook file as the attachment.To make these attacks even more deceptive for the victims, the threat actors use a fake button in the Notebook file that supposedly downloads the document from the cloud, but if clicked, it instead runs the embedded HTA attachment.While this action will generate a warning dialog for the victim warning about the risks of running attachments, there's always a chance that it will be ignored.As a defense against this new attack vector, Sophos suggests that email administrators consider blocking all .one file extensions, as they are not commonly sent as attachments. "

However, it requires being part of the preview, which is slowly adding new users.Microsoft says that users can \"get ahead in the line\" by downloading the 'Microsoft Defaults' program, which sets Edge and Bing as your default browser and search engine, and by installing the Microsoft Bing app.In BleepingComputer's tests, this did not allow us to immediately get access to Bing's AI chat feature but allegedly moved us up on the waiting list.For those that can't yet access the preview, Microsoft has shared the following chat queries that you can test today to see how the new AI-powered search engine works:For example, if you ask Bing to suggest a 3-course menu, it will generate a menu using recipes from the search index. When generating the AI-chat answer, each sourced item will link to the original source.Microsoft also uses the AI model with the core Bing search-ranking engine, which, according to the company, has led to \"the largest jump in relevance in two decades,\" making searches more relevant and accurate."

Running this file installed the Remcos program on the victim's computer. CERT-UA did not disclose which Ukrainian government services were targeted by phishing emails or whether hackers managed to successfully install the spyware. The agency pinned the effort on a group labeled UAC-0050 that has been active in Ukraine since 2020. The hackers carried out previous attacks using remote desktop software Remote Utilities, CERT-UA said.A possible goal of the group is espionage, according to CERT-UA, as its members mostly targeted Ukraine’s government services.Breaking Security openly advertises Remcos on its website, describing it as “a lightweight, fast, and highly customizable remote administration tool with a wide array of functionalities.” Users can download the free version of the software or buy the premium version for €58 ($62). This Excel file displayed a yellow security bar warning the victim about dangerous macro code. The file message lured the victim into clicking the button to bypass the warning and execute the malicious macro code, Fortinet explains.With Remcos software, hackers can steal user credentials, gain control over online accounts and deploy additional malware variants on an infected computer, researchers said.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " Many online stores are exposing private backups in public folders, including internal account passwords, which can be leveraged to take over the e-commerce sites and extort owners.The study examined 2,037 stores of various sizes and found that 250 (12.3%) exposed ZIP, SQL, and TAR archives on public web folders that can be freely accessed without requiring authentication.The archives appear to be backups containing database passwords, secret administrator URLs, internal API keys, and customer PII (personally identifiable information).In the same report, Sansec explains that its analysts observe constant activity from attackers who launch automated scans trying to pinpoint these backups and perform breaches.“Exposed secrets have been used to gain control of stores, extort merchants and intercept customer payments.”Threat actors try out various combinations of possible backup names on target sites based on the site name and public DNS data, such as “/db/staging-SITENAME.zip.”Because these probes are inexpensive to run and do not affect the target store’s performance, threat actors can conduct them for entire weeks until they find a backup.Sansec reports seeing multiple source IPs for these attacks, so threat actors are well aware of the existence of exposed backups, and many of them are attempting to take advantage.If the exposed backups contain administrator details, master database passwords, or staff accounts, the attackers can use them to gain access to the site and steal data or perform destructive attacks.Sansec urges website owners to routinely check their sites for accidentally exposed data and backup.If you have exposed a website backup publicly, immediately reset admin accounts and database passwords, and enable 2FA on all staff accounts.Additionally, check the web server logs to see if the backup was downloaded by a third party, and check admin account activity logs to identify signs of external access and malicious behavior.Sansec suggests that website administrators configure the webserver to restrict access to archive files if not needed in daily operations to prevent data leaks. Additionally, those using the Adobe Commerce platform should use the “immutable storage” feature."

      "text": " A new version of the Medusa DDoS (distributed denial of service) botnet, based on Mirai code, has appeared in the wild, featuring a ransomware module and a Telnet brute-forcer.Moreover, Medusa is now promoted as a MaaS (malware-as-a-service) for DDoS or mining via a dedicated portal. It promises service stability, client anonymity, support, an easy-to-use API, and adjustable cost based on specific needs.What's particularly interesting in this new Medusa variant is a ransomware function that enables it to search all directories for valid file types for encryption. The list of target file types includes mainly documents and vector design files.Valid files are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption, and the .medusastealer extension is appended to the encrypted files' nameHowever, the encryption method appears broken, turning the ransomware into a data wiper.After encrypting files on the device, the malware sleeps for 86,400 seconds (24 hours) and deletes all files on the system drives.Only after deleting files does it display a ransom note that asks for the payment of 0.5 BTC ($11,400), which is counter-intuitive for a successful extortion attempt.Cyble believes this is an error in the code as the destruction of system drives makes it impossible for the victims to use their systems and read the ransom note. This bug also indicates that the new Medusa variant, or at least this feature, is still in development.It's worth noting that while the new version of Medusa features a data exfiltration tool, it does not steal user files before encryption. Instead, it focuses on collecting basic system information that helps in identifying victims and estimating resources that can be used for mining and DDoS attacks.Medusa also features a brute forcer that tries out commonly used usernames and passwords against internet-connected devices. Then, if successful, it attempts to download an additional payload that Cyble hasn't been able to retrieve and analyze.Next, Medusa executes the \"zmap\" command to find other devices with Telnet services running on port 23 and then tries to connect to them using the retrieved IP addresses and a combination of usernames and passwords.Finally, upon establishing a Telnet connection, the malware infects the system with the primary Medusa payload (\"infection_medusa_stealer\").The final Medusa payload also has incomplete support for receiving the “FivemBackdoor” and “sshlogin” commands.However, the corresponding code isn’t present in the client Python file yet, which is another sign of its ongoing development."

NetApp indicated it is still investigating whether any host utilities for SAN for Windows may also impacted. In October IBM warned its Tivoli Monitoring solution was impacted by the bug.A successful exploitation of the bug, NetApp warned, “could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service.”HPE explained that Expat is used by its OneView platform to parse various XMLs. The bug, HPE said, only impacts versions of HPE OneView prior to 8.1. In a technical summary, HPE explained vulnerable systems allow an “attacker to triage a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.”NIST wrote, versions of Expat (libexpat) before 2.4.9 have a use-after-free in the doContent function in xmlparse.c.

      "text": "  By exploiting the unpatched devices, the threat actors are able to gain network compromise and escalate privileges. The researchers have observed other possible victims from other verticals, which also led to data exfiltration.WithSecure has identified the ongoing campaign’s victims in healthcare research, a manufacturer of technology used in energy, research, defense, and healthcare verticals, and a chemical engineering department of a leading research university.Dubbed \"No Pineapple,\" the attacks leave an error message in a backdoors appended with the name “in the event data exceeds segmented byte size.” The report shows it appears these attacks are designed to gather intelligence from victim organizations. “The victimology follows the established pattern of high-value targets in medical research and energy, additionally WithSecure believes the threat actor has intentionally targeted the supply chain of these verticals,” according to the report.As reported in the fall of 2022, a critical remote code vulnerability listed as CVE-2022-41352 and rated a 9.8 in severity was reported as actively exploited in the wild beginning in mid-September. The flaw is caused by the devices using an antivirus engine that employs a cpio utility to scan inbound emails. A vulnerability in the utility can enable an attacker to create an archive to access any files within the Zimbra devices.The WithSecure report suggests that this is exactly what happened.Its researchers responded to a cyberattack leveraging these tactics during Q4 2022, which has been attributed with high confidence to the Lazarus Group. The forensic evidence shows signs of characteristics leveraged by the North Korea state-sponsored threat actors in other  campaigns.The attack was deployed against a Zimbra mail server in August, where the attackers exploited a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Zimbra server. After a week of dwell time, the threat actor exfiltrated approximately 100GB of data from the mail server without taking any “destructive action by the point of disruption.”After one month, the threat actor laterally moved to a vulnerable domain joined by a Windows XP device. Over a monthlong period, the attacker continued to move laterally across the network, performing reconnaissance, and deploying multiple custom tools and malware. Dtrack was one variant used, which the researchers believe is an updated version of GREASE.In the observed campaign, the threat actor used readily available, off-the-shelf webshells and custom binaries, in addition to abusing legitimate Windows and Unix tools. A successful exploit can enable an attacker to install tools for proxying, tunneling, and relaying connections.The “actor used many built-in commands to enumerate the network and compromised devices,” the report notes. “Some of these commands were hardcoded into binaries, but others were run manually by the operators. Many commands used were standard Windows command line tools, though two PowerShell cmdlets were also run.”Its C2 behavior suggests that it employs a small number of C2 servers, which are connected through multiple relays and endpoints. The report notes that “some C2 servers appear to themselves be compromised victims.”What’s more, “web shells and Cobalt Strike beacons were observed which served as persistence mechanisms, the report authors wrote. Legitimate accounts were also compromised, and the threat actors created illegitimate accounts. The actor also created auto-run services and scheduled tasks, commonly used to persist on a network.The researchers warned that the actor also attempted to remove artifacts and indicators of their presence, such as deleting files and tools and clearing logs, to evade detection. They also tried “to give dropped files innocent names which would blend into the system.” In one instance, they named files the same as directories within a parent network of exploited Zimbra servers.The report contains a long list of tactics and methods deployed during the observed campaign that can support identification and possible remediation.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  OpenEMR is a popular electronic health records system with an estimated 5,000 downloads each month by 100,000 global providers and serving over 200 million patients. Maintained by a community of volunteers and support professionals, OpenEMR is notably used by PeaceCorps, IPPF, and the Siaya District Hospital in Kenya. The Sonar report details the unauthenticated file read, authenticated local file inclusion, and an authenticated reflected XSS. Without the patch, “a rogue MySQL server can read arbitrary files from an OpenEMR instance,” according to the report. Further, the installer fails to delete itself after a successful installation and, as the setup is divided into parts, an unauthenticated user can perform some actions through a user-controlled parameter state.As a result, an unauthenticated attacker would be able to perform a database query on their own server by enabling the MySQL statement LOAD DATA to load the contents of a file into a database table.“If the modifier LOCAL is given, the file is read from the client instead of the server,” Sonar researchers wrote.An attacker-controlled MySQL configuration can lead to the compromise of the arbitrary file read vulnerability. And when combined with the two other flaws, an unauthorized attacker can take over the device and deploy remote code execution.The HC3 alert warns that each of these flaws “represent opportunities for cybercriminals to launch ransomware attacks and data breaches — both of which are persistent threats to the health sector, among other types of attacks.”Although providers can completely reinstall OpenEMR, the alert warns that attackers can specify a configuration during the setup steps via the properties of the Installer class to take over any OpenEMR instance.As noted, OpenEMR maintainers addressed all of these serious vulnerabilities and further hardened the application in its November 2022 update to version 7.0.0 of the platform.The EMR now includes a series of CSRF checks and sessions to patch the arbitrary file read vulnerability, which also further restricts the installation process. Now, even an unauthenticated attacker would need to go through the installation steps in the correct order. And “when a config file already exists in an installed OpenEMR instance, the setup process fails in the first step.”OpenEMR also strengthened the PHP function to encode important characters and blocks the ability of an attacker to escape the context and prevents the XSS vulnerability. The update also sanitized the user-controlled parameter, which now only allows alphanumeric characters to prevent path traversal.OpenEMR intends to bolster this process to reduce the risk of potential exploit, as well.Maintainers of the OpenEMR are notoriously responsive to any potential vulnerabilities. In one notable instance from 2018, when researchers found nearly 30 critical vulnerabilities in the platform that left millions of patient records vulnerable to attack. It was the second round of security flaws found that year.Those bugs included flaws that could enable an attacker to bypass the patient portal authentication and navigate to the registration page, as well as change the URL. A number of SQL injection bugs were also found that could be used to view data from targeted databases. The round of disclosures included other remote code execution vulnerabilities.Much like the latest vulnerability disclosure, OpenEMR was quick to provide an update that eliminated these risks.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Atlassian has confirmed exploitation of an already addressed Confluence Data Center and Server flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-22518, to facilitate ransomware deployment after a Rapid7 report observed related infections with the Cerber ransomware, which is long believed to be defunct, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.SecurityWeek reports that patches have been released by Veeam to remediate four security vulnerabilities impacting its Veeam ONE IT monitoring and analytics solution.It’s clear iLeakage presents itself as a major flaw with no known mitigation and it’s a real problem for iOS devices – here are some ideas on how to respond.

As with all additions to the list, CISA explained that the vulnerabilities are “frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.”SugarCRM released a report on January 13 claiming that “no intrusion has been detected in any instances of Sugar Sell, Enterprise, Professional, Serve, and Ultimate software solutions running in the SugarCloud.” Andrew Barratt, vice president at Coalfire, told The Record that SugarCRM is a hugely popular customer relations management product often used by small and medium enterprises as well as middle market organizations.“The vulnerability announced allows for remote code execution which creates substantial amounts of risk,” he said. “CRM tools typically have large amounts of both personal data and commercially sensitive information. Often these are a treasure trove of deals and opportunities. There is downstream risk though if a CRM is compromised whilst the data might be considered to belong to the user. That data is probably relevant to many of their customers creating an amplification of the issue.”Netenrich’s John Bambenek noted that the two vulnerabilities represented two very different market segments, illustrating the wide array of targets nation-states and cybercriminals now have access to. “SugarCRM is going after the small business market and those who don’t have the resourcing to pay for and fully realize the value of SalesForce,” he said. “Oracle is on the other end of that spectrum with many enterprise users.

This included the use of a hacktivist identity (Holy Souls) in claiming credit for the attack, the leaking of private data, and the use of fake — or \"sockpuppet\" — social media personas to amplify news of the attack on Charlie Hebdo.For instance, following the attack, two social media accounts (one impersonating a senior French tech executive and the other an editor at Charlie Hebdo) began posting screenshots of the leaked information, Microsoft said. The company said its researchers observed other fake social media accounts tweeting news of the attack to media organizations, while others accused Charlie Hebdo of working on behalf of the French government.The FBI has described the group's MO as including first-stage reconnaissance on potential targets via Web searches, and then using the results to scan for vulnerable software that the targets could be using. \"In some instances, the objective may have been to exploit a large number of networks/websites in a particular sector as opposed to a specific organization target,\" the FBI has noted. \"In other situations, Emennet would also attempt to identify hosting/shared hosting services.\"When attempting to break into a target network, Neptunium first verifies if the organization might be using default passwords for specific applications, and it tries to identify admin or login pages. \"It should be assumed Emennet may attempt common plaintext passwords for any login sites they identify,\" the FBI said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Hive takedown illustrates FBI's evolution towards victim-recovery efforts | SC Media",
      "text": "  FBI Director Christopher Wray, center, joined by Attorney General Merrick Garland, right, and Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco, delivers remarks on an international ransomware enforcement action at the U.S. Justice Department on Jan. 26, 2023, in Washington. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The bureau was pilloried by much of the broader cybersecurity community, as well as members of Congress, for seemingly prioritizing its own investigative and law enforcement activities while leaving hundreds of Kaseya customers twisting in the wind, agonizing over whether to pay millions of dollars in ransom or refuse and see their data lost or leaked on the internet.Former Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus who built a reputation as one of the most cyber-savvy House legislators, echoed the frustration of many on the Hill and within the private sector when he chided Wray for the bureau’s response, analogizing it to the police blocking firefighters from putting out a house fire because it might damage forensic evidence that would help them investigate the arsonist. “I would just push back and say that asset response has to be higher on the priority list. So much could have been prevented had those decryption keys been given to businesses that were impacted,” said Langevin.The reaction from former critics like Langevin — as well as the details of the Hive takedown, public comments by FBI leadership and interviews with former government officials — indicate that the bureau may be internalizing some of the hard lessons it took from the fallout of the Kaseya incident when it comes to prioritizing victim recovery.Austin Berglas, a former FBI cyber official, said the Kaseya and Hive operations “are things that are new situations that law enforcement and the FBI have been put into” over the past half decade as cybercrime, state-backed hacks and other forms of digital crime have become higher priorities for law enforcement and policymakers.“I think that when you look at what happened with Kaseya and now Hive — [there were] huge lessons learned,” said Berglas, now global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, in an interview.That learning curve includes a renewed emphasis on victim recovery, both in operational priorities and public messaging.Whereas during the Kaseya episode the FBI opted to keep their possession of REvil’s decryptor key a secret from victims, a search warrant used to seize two U.S.-based Hive servers on Jan. 11 this year disclosed that agents had actually infiltrated the ransomware group’s network six months earlier, spending part of that time stealing over 1,000 decryptors that they then quietly passed along to over 300 victims and businesses.Wray and others practically treated their press conference announcing the takedown as a commercial to advertise the unique benefits that businesses and victims could potentially reap by picking up the phone and calling the FBI in the wake of an incident.“Our actions in this investigation should speak clearly to those victims: it pays to come forward and to work with us…we need your help to stop cyber criminals to prevent future victims and in exchange, we pledge our tireless efforts to help you protect your systems and to prevent or recover losses,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at one point.To be clear, there is still a fair bit we do not know about the precise circumstances behind the Hive operation, such as what pushed the FBI to move on seizing the servers and shutting down Hive’s dark net sites in January, how early the FBI used its access to Hive’s network to pilfer victim keys (Monaco said the activities went on “for months”) or precisely how the bureau balanced those needs with other investigative and disruptive priorities.I think a lot of this is a reaction to things that they didn’t quite get right, or at least the perception that they didn’t get right, in the Kaseya case,” said Bryan Ware, a former assistant director at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and is now CEO of LookingGlass Cyber Solutions. “You can’t just tell businesses not to pay the ransom but then they’re left to their own devices. This [incident] shows…that the bureau has some teeth here and is willing to be a good partner.”The Department of Justice will likely always need to walk a fine line between helping victims and gathering intelligence or moving to dismantle ransomware infrastructure before a group is potentially tipped off that their network is compromised. However, the renewed public focus on recovering lost data and getting organizations back up and running is “absolutely a message of success and something that they will use as a foundation going forward.”“Private companies want to know, [if I] share my intelligence and share my information, what am I going to get back? That’s the question always,” said Berglas, relaying feedback the government frequently hears from cooperating businesses. “Often times we’re giving indicators of compromise and domains and IP addresses and all this stuff, but I never hear anything back from you guys. This is the [FBI’s] message, this is saying if you report these things to us, our aperture can open up, we can start helping you.”One of the reasons the FBI and Department of Justice are increasingly emphasizing their remediation and recovery efforts these days may be because they have lost ground over the past few years to other federal agencies when it comes to being the cybersecurity communication gateway to the private sector.Chiefly, the elevation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency over the past five years has eaten into the FBI’s role as the primary federal entry point for hacked organizations.There remain large and meaningful differences between the writs of FBI’s and CISA over cybersecurity issues. For instance, CISA has little if any authorities over traditional law enforcement investigations or prosecution of cybercrime, focusing mainly on coordinating with private sector entities and providing technical assistance to insecure organizations. It’s also far smaller, less resourced and lacks the authorities or capabilities to do anything like the Hive takedown.Wray often likes to note that the FBI has well-staffed field offices in every state and can often be at the door of a hacked business “within an hour” of getting a call. Ware noted that despite the increased authorities and funding from Congress, CISA still lacks anything close to that kind of reach and presence, with approximately 150 cybersecurity advisors spread out across all 50 states.“I think there is a desire to have that single front door [for the private sector] but there’s some practical challenges. One of those is that if it’s a criminal matter, CISA is not a law enforcement agency, it doesn’t have the criminal authorities, it can’t do the same kind of investigations, it can’t recover lost funds, it can’t bring the bad guys to justice,” said Ware.The flip side is that while the FBI and Wray have far more resources to bring to bear, the bureau also have a much larger mission portfolio and their top cyber officials tend to operate lower in departmental hierarchy. By contrast, CISA and its director, Jen Easterly, essentially function as the top cybersecurity authorities within the Department of Homeland Security (although technically other officials, like undersecretary Rob Silvers, sit above Easterly and wield influence over policy), allowing for a sharper focus on cyber issues.That hasn’t stopped FBI officials from continuing to insist, as Wray did at the end of the Hive presser, that the agency still has a unique federal role and capabilities that should incentivize the private sector to reach out when they are hit with a cyberattack.“Today’s lesson for businesses large and small, for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this: reach out to your local FBI field office today. Introduce yourself so that you know who to call if you become the victim of a cyber attack,” said Wray. “We are ready to help you build a crisis response plan so that when an intruder does come knocking, you’ll be prepared and like the Hive victims here, when you talk to us in advance…you will know how we operate quickly and quietly, giving you the assistance, the intelligence and the technical information that you want and you need.”Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": " The challenges facing chief information security officers (CISOs) have evolved dramatically in the past decade. Today, they must align their security efforts — and budgets — with the business goals of their organization, which may range from maintaining customer confidence that their data is safe to protecting intellectual property from theft.As a key member of the executive management team, CISOs often have board-level reporting responsibilities. They must manage a new and daunting level of technical complexity introduced by the cloud, where identities are virtually the first and last line of defense. And the job doesn't end there. To be successful, they must also put substantial effort into building a team with skills in a variety of disciplines, and choosing the right defensive technologies.Data-center-oriented companies that have transitioned to the cloud obviously face a new set of security concerns that conventional firewalls were never designed to handle. Hence, the now commonly heard refrain \"Identity is the new perimeter.\" This is certainly true. While firewalls and other network-based controls shouldn't be abandoned, CISOs need to focus on identity issues. The following three-step process can deliver results in this area quickly and efficiently.Correlate excess privileges and misconfigurations. Cloud misconfigurations are another serious risk. But when a privileged identity has access to a misconfigured cloud resource, the results can be disastrous. Fortunately, automated tools are now available to help detect misconfigurations, as well as excessive privileges, and remediate them to eliminate threats.Cloud engineering. The security team also needs to handle the day-to-day requirements of cloud security, which may include management, maintenance, and more. Competent cloud engineering is essential for \"keeping the lights on\" in the security sphere.One approach that works well as a supplement to hiring is development from within through training. This may occur in-house or through third-party certification programs. Also, in choosing vendors, organizations should favor those whose offerings include a strong training component. If possible, CISOs may find ways to get non-security employees to work on some security tasks.To sum up, the challenges facing today's CISOs are largely driven by the cloud, which creates a greatly expanded attack surface that needs to be protected. Meanwhile, mastering the management model and tools used by each cloud platform requires security expertise that is in extremely short supply. Solutions are available that provide the visibility and platform knowledge needed to help security teams implement best practices for protecting their cloud infrastructure, while helping them up-skill analysts in the process.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Finland’s Most-Wanted Hacker Nabbed in France – Krebs on Security",
      "text": " Julius “Zeekill” Kivimäki, a 25-year-old Finnish man charged with extorting a local online psychotherapy practice and leaking therapy notes for more than 22,000 patients online, was arrested this week in France. A notorious hacker convicted of perpetrating tens of thousands of cybercrimes, Kivimäki had been in hiding since October 2022, when he failed to show up in court and Finland issued an international warrant for his arrest.In late October 2022, Kivimäki was charged (and “arrested in absentia,” according to the Finns) with attempting to extort money from the Vastaamo Psychotherapy Center. In that breach, which occurred in October 2020, a hacker using the handle “Ransom Man” threatened to publish patient psychotherapy notes if Vastaamo did not pay a six-figure ransom demand.Vastaamo refused, so Ransom Man shifted to extorting individual patients — sending them targeted emails threatening to publish their therapy notes unless paid a 500-euro ransom.When Ransom Man found little success extorting patients directly, they uploaded to the dark web a large compressed file containing all of the stolen Vastaamo patient records.“It was a huge opsec [operational security] fail, because they had a lot of stuff in there — including the user’s private SSH folder, and a lot of known hosts that we could take a very good look at,” Kurittu told KrebsOnSecurity, declining to discuss specifics of the evidence investigators seized. “There were also other projects and databases.”Police responding to the scene were admitted by another woman — possibly a roommate — and found the man inside still sleeping off a long night. When they roused him and asked for identification, the 6′ 3″ blonde, green-eyed man presented an ID that stated he was of Romanian nationality.The French police were doubtful. After consulting records on most-wanted criminals, they quickly identified the man as Kivimäki and took him into custody.Kivimaki and other HTP members were involved in mass-compromising web servers using known vulnerabilities, and by 2012 Kivimäki’s alias Ryan Cleary was selling access to those servers in the form of a DDoS-for-hire service. Kivimäki was 15 years old at the time.The DDoS-for-hire service allegedly operated by Kivimäki in 2012.In 2013, investigators going through devices seized from Kivimäki found computer code that had been used to crack more than 60,000 web servers using a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe’s ColdFusion software.As KrebsOnSecurity reported at the time, this small ColdFusion botnet of data broker servers was being controlled by the same cybercriminals who’d assumed control over ssndob[.]ms, which operated one of the underground’s most reliable services for obtaining Social Security Number, dates of birth and credit file information on U.S. residents.Kivimäki also was involved in calling in multiple fake bomb threats and “swatting” incidents — reporting fake hostage situations at an address to prompt a heavily armed police response to that location.Kivimäki’s apparent indifference to hiding his tracks drew the interest of Finnish and American cybercrime investigators, and soon Finnish prosecutors charged him with an array of cybercrime violations. At trial, prosecutors presented evidence showing he’d used stolen credit cards to buy luxury goods and shop vouchers, and participated in a money laundering scheme that he used to fund a trip to Mexico.Kivimäki was ultimately convicted of orchestrating more than 50,000 cybercrimes. But largely because he was still a minor at the time (17) , he was given a 2-year suspended sentence and ordered to forfeit EUR 6,558.“The danger in such a decision is that it emboldens young malicious hackers by reinforcing the already popular notion that there are no consequences for cybercrimes committed by individuals under the age of 18.Kivimäki is now crowing about the sentence; He’s changed the description on his Twitter profile to “Untouchable hacker god.” The Twitter account for the Lizard Squad tweeted the news of Kivimäki’s non-sentencing triumphantly: “All the people that said we would rot in prison don’t want to comprehend what we’ve been saying since the beginning, we have free passes.”Something tells me Kivimäki won’t get off so easily this time, assuming he is successfully extradited back to Finland. A statement by the Finnish police says they are seeking Kivimäki’s extradition and that they expect the process to go smoothly.“Same thing,” Kivimäki replied. “Shall we start some kind of club? A support organization for wanted persons?”\r\n         This entry was posted on Sunday 5th of February 2023 11:14 AM \r\n         Interesting  article,   a guy  with  anger  issues  , that  does swatting, bomb threats  and  domestic violence , hacks into  a psychotherapy practice without  any remorse Who  see’s  the irony  here ?Fantastic news, and well done to all of the investigators involved! Kivimaki has been a menace to society, stealing money and blackmailing ever since he got a slap on the wrist for 50,000 counts of hacking. There are many reformed hackers, but Kivimaki is not one of them.Yes — string this career hacker criminal up by his thumbs, in Solitary Confinement, for the rest of his twisted life.  Far too many times these cybercrooks get a mild slap on the wrist and they’re back on the cyber highway after spreading their knowledge to anyone smart enough with whom they’re incarcerated.Make an example of this punk!I totally agree. All hackers need to be held accountable and given serious prison sentences.  Additionally, they should be prohibited from using any technology for their entire sentence.  They should be limited to only writing letters and sending them by snail mail or 5 minute monitored plain old trlephone calls  home.   Confinement should ensure that their technical skills go down the toilet forever.  Do not pamper these criminals.  I would rather see minor drug abusers be given a break and rehabilitation and let all these cyber criminals rot in prison.  These criminals are attacking medical organizations and that makes the violent criminals against the sick.Gutter criminal. Off with his head. (Not kidding)Zut alors!\nAleksanteri, bienvenue a la belle France!!!I have often traversed Romania with a “New Jersey passport”, but have yet to meet a 6’-3” Romanian male who resembled a blond, green-eyed, Nordic giant…Understood that this was a bad “fast guess” by you, when those gendarmerie rudely interrupted your slumber.\n(Aren’t the only blonds in Romania from a bleach bottle?)However, keep your spirits up and positive.\nLike the rest of us, into every data thug’s life, a little rain must fall…Remember, you are very lucky to be in the EU/Finland justice system. But in case you are extradited to the US, a few tips…\nEmphasize that you never used a gun for your alleged ill-gotten gains.\nNo gun in your crime, means 6 hours in a US jail unless the fraud was above US$1 million.\n(If you used a gun to rob $3.14 in the street, that’s 15 years for openers.)Yes, then you will get 3 hots and a cot, plus almost good health and dental care.\nBut avoid “Fat Albert” in cell block B…The wheels of human justice grind slowly Aleks, but inexorably…\nWe will somehow recover from missing you on Tik Tok…Weird spam is weird.like those he hurts & everyone else, dude has embarrassing secrets.\npls, someone, put him in his place & spill it.I wish he wouldn’t of gotten caught!!! All of the governments including there officials have been robbing the people. Modern day slavery. FREE HIM UNTIL ITS READ BACKWARDSGrow up. He destroyed people’s lives and if governments were not providing basic infrastructure people that need the Internet would not exist. The real survivalist live off the grid.This is really good news. I hope it will bring some kind of closure to the individuals affected especially by the absolutely shameless Vastaamo data breach and patient record publication.Who among us hasn’t accidentally uploaded our entire /home to the dark web? His arrogance seems unwarranted. Glad he’ll be out of circulation.Its honestly a wonder why he didn’t get caught sooner, being that stupid. Im legitimately bewildered as to how that happensGlad to see some of the worst of humans get a little suffering too, for a change.He used his keyboards/computers just like a gun in the back! He is a COWARD and a THUG that sneeks into our private and professional lives. It’s time for raising the amount of time and TRUTH in SENTENCING for CYBER CRIMINALS. Onec the thief is released keep him/them on paper for 10 yrs. C if these looser laugh at that!“I’d rather not be paid in imaginary money”…I enjoy these stories. Thank you Brian Krebs.Sadly, the Finnish criminal law system is notoriously lenient and understanding to criminals. If he gets 2 years (let alone more), that would be extraordinary. After that, the system is heavily geared towards integrating this PoS back into society.But of course things like this – bullying, abusing and extorting the vulnerable – is not something that is generally kindly looked on by hardcore criminals. Recently, a suspected child molester (who was apparently innocent, however) was beaten and tortured to death by other prisoners while in police custody in Finland.\nIt is entirely possible that Julius Kivimäki might have a very interesting jail time, involving one or more peculiar ‘accidents’.You cannot put child molesting on the same level as extortion. No one in prison will do that lolWho would attack a healthcare organization? That is really low. This is where folks are struggling to stay alive and you will go over and pull the plug to buy Gucci socks?  Even Satan stopped that. Lock him up for a long time and update the laws that allow these acts to persist. If you are truly smart with computers, use your skills for good and you will be rewarded by society.kyllästyi patonkiin? vois kirjottaa kirjan ja kääntyä uskoon tiilenpäitä lueskellessa?I think this kid needs a job and a wife. I say cut his index fingers clean off, tattoo a big shlong on his forhead and mutilate his toung. He will soon then seek mental health he saught to abuse in the passed. then release him. Let the world and life be his punishment“shifted to extorting individual patients — sending them targeted emails threatening to publish their therapy notes”\nThreatening psy patients? I wish for him some of them were not hard-boiled psychopath…It’s concerning to see the extent of damage that one individual can inflict through cybercrime. The fact that Julius Kivimäki has been involved in numerous hacking incidents, including the extortion and leak of therapy notes for thousands of patients, is alarming.\nHopefully, his arrest will serve as a warning to others who engage in similar activities, and reinforce the importance of cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information.Comments are closed.Mailing ListSearch KrebsOnSecurityRecent PostsStory CategoriesWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia"

The campaign abuses legitimate but compromised email accounts to send stolen data to external mail accounts controlled by the attackers.By: Mohamed Fahmy, Sherif Magdy, Mahmoud Zohdy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFebruary 02, 2023\nRead time:  ( words)\n\tSave to FolioOn December 2022, we identified a suspicious executable (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.MSIL.REDCAP.AD) that was dropped and executed on multiple machines. Our investigation led us to link this attack to advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT34, and the main goal is to steal users’ credentials. Even in case of a password reset or change, the malware is capable of sending the new credentials to the threat actors. Moreover, after analyzing the backdoor variant deployed, we found the malware capable of new exfiltration techniques — the abuse of compromised mailbox accounts to send stolen data from the internal mail boxes to external mail accounts controlled by the attackers. While not new as a technique, this is the first instance that APT34 used this for their campaign deployment. Following this analysis, it is highly likely that this campaign’s routine is only a small part of a bigger chain of deployments. Users and organizations are strongly advised to reinforce their current security measures and to be vigilant of the possible vectors abused for compromise.RoutineIn this section, we describe the attack infection flow and its respective stages, as well as share details on how the group uses emails to steal and exfiltrate critical information.First Stage: Initial DroppersWe found the initial stage .Net dropper malware called MrPerfectInstaller (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.MSIL.REDCAP.AD) responsible for dropping four different files, with each component stored in a Base64 buffer inside the main dropper. It drops the following: The dropper also adds the following registry key to assist in implementing the password filter dropped earlier:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Lsa \n Notification Packages = scecli, psgfilterThe main .Net binary implements two arguments for its operation: the first argument for installing the second stage, and the second argument for uninstalling it and unregistering the password filter dropped.Second Stage:  Abusing The Dropped Password Filter PolicyThese password filters can be abused by a threat actor as a method to intercept or retrieve credentials from domain users (domain controller) or local accounts (local computer). This is because for password filters to perform, password validation requires the password of the user in plaintext from the Local Security Authority (LSA). Therefore, installing and registering an arbitrary password filter could be used to harvest credentials every time a user changes his password. This technique requires elevated access (local administrator) and can be implemented with the following steps:Using this technique, the malicious actor can capture and harvest every password from the compromised machines even after the modification. The DLL has three export functions to implement the main functionality of support for registering the DLL into the LSA, as follows:When implementing the password filter export functions, the malicious actor took great care working with the plaintext passwords. When sent over networks, the plaintext passwords were first encrypted before being exfiltrated.Data Exfiltration Through Legitimate Mail TrafficThe main backdoor function (detected by Trend Micro as Backdoor.MSIL.REDCAP.A) receives the valid domain credentials as an argument and uses it to log on to the Exchange Server and use it for data exfiltration purposes. The main function of this stage is to take the stolen password from the argument and send it to the attackers as an attachment in an email. We also observed that the threat actors relay these emails via government Exchange Servers using vaild accounts with stolen passwords. First, the .Net backdoor parses a config file dropped in the main root path where it is executing from and checks for a file callled ngb inside <%ProgramData%\\WindowsSoftwareDevices\\DevicesTemp\\> to extract three parameters:However, the malware also supports for the modification of old passwords to new ones, which are sent through the registered DLL password filter. The malware proceeds to initialize an ExchangeService object in the first step and supplies the stolen credentials as WebCredentials to interface with the victim mail server in the second step. Using these Exchange Web Service (EWS) bindings, the malicious actor can send mails to external recipients on behalf of any stolen user and initialize a new instance of the WebCredentials class with the username and password for the account to authenticate.The malware then iterates through the files found under the target path. For each file found, it adds its path to a list, which will be exfiltrated later in the last step.The final stage is to iterate over the collected list of file paths. For each path, it prepares an EmailMessage object with the subject “Exchange Default Message”, and a mail body content of “Exchange Server is testing services.” The iteration attaches the whole file to this EmailMessage object and sends it using the previous initalized EWS form (Steps 1 and 2 in Figure 10), which already authenticated the user account.APT34 Targeting and Arsenal EvolutionFrom three previously documented attacks, we observed that while the group uses simple malware families, these deployments show the group's flexibility to write new malware based on researched customer environments and levels of access. This level of skill can make attribution for security researchers and reverse engineers more difficult in terms of tracking and monitoring because patterns, behaviors, and tools can be completely different for every compromise.While not at the top of the group’s list, other countries in the Middle East considered as targets are Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, and Egypt.Attribution AnalysisThere are several data points and indicators that suggest APT34 carried out this attack, and that this group is still active in targeting countries in the Middle East with a special focus on compromising government entities.1.     The first stage dropper2.     Leveraging exchange servers for communications (Uni- and bidirectional)3.      The victim targetedConclusionsAt first glance, security teams can mistakenly tag the sample as safe or as a benign activity given the validity of the domains and mail credentials. It will take more experienced analysts to see that the domains abused is part of a bigger active directory domain “forest”, which share a trust relationship with each other to allow different government ministries or agencies to communicate. Considering we found a compromised account from one entity inside a sample sourced from a different agency indicates APT34 now has a deep foothold in the government domain forest.Following the stages executed, APT34’s repeated use of the Saitama backdoor technique in the first stage indicates a confidence that even the dated malware’s technique will continue to work and initiate compromise.The next stages for exfiltrating data, however, are considerably new and are considered exploratory for the group. Despite the routine's simplicity, the novelty of the second and last stages also indicate that this entire routine can just be a small part of a bigger campaign targeting governments. We continue tracking and monitoring the abuse of this threat to determine the depth and breadth of this compromise.Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)Emails abusedAdditional insights provided by AbdelRahman Yasser.Mohamed FahmyThreat Intelligence AnalystSherif MagdyThreat Intelligence AnalystMahmoud ZohdyThreat Intelligence AnalystTry our services free for 30 daysSelect a country / regionCopyright ©2023 Trend Micro Incorporated.

      "text": " Dashlane announced it had made the source code for its Android and iOS apps available on GitHub under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license.The popular subscription-based password manager and digital wallet have decided to release the code of its mobile apps to increase transparency in how they operate while also promoting a more collaborative and open development approach going forward.By making its mobile app's code available to anyone for exploration and auditing, the company hopes to receive feedback from the community on improving it and increased security vulnerability reports from cybersecurity researchers.The password manager maker says this \"opening up\" will also incentivize its engineers to \"level up\" the quality of the code and make it suitable for the masses to read and understand.Dashlane plans to update these code snapshots on GitHub every three months, but it might do it more frequently if the associated processes are enhanced accordingly.Open-sourcing software means making its code available to anyone for scrutiny, inherently increasing trust in the product.Moreover, it gives software engineers another example of how things are done, which is especially important when this example comes from a successful project.However, it's important to note that Dashlane has not transitioned to becoming an open-source project overnight, and for the time being, no direct contributions from the community can be accepted. Suggestions will still be welcomed and listened to, though.We should also clarify that the source code release concerns only the client apps for Android and iOS, so those of macOS and Windows remain closed-source.It's also worth noting that while the source code for the mobile client applications has been made publicly available, a significant portion of the password management system operates on Dashlane's servers and has not been released. This means that a substantial part of the product remains proprietary.This, of course, does not degrade the importance of this first step taken by Dashlane, and the software vendor has already promised that more will follow.The next product to be open-sourced, according to Dashlane, is its web browser extension, but this will happen after it has fully transitioned to meeting the Google Chrome MV3 requirements."

At publishing time we had yet to receive a reply.Before you put your money into any cryptocurrency project, research the token and the team behind it and look for red flags like incomplete data or too little information on the official website.Cryptocurrency investors should openly ask about a project in the community to hear the experience of other users. If you're getting into this trading game, it is recommended to use only reputable exchange services and diversify investments across different coins."

      "text": " The New York attorney general's office has announced a $410,000 fine for a stalkerware developer who used 16 companies to promote surveillance tools illegally.Stalkerware (or spyware) platforms allow their customers to monitor other people's phones without the users' knowledge. In some, if not most cases, they're also used to monitor the targets' online activity and collect sensitive user information like their location that later could be used for blackmail or various other malicious purposes.Patrick Hinchy, the spyware vendor, also agreed to alert his customers' victims that their phones are being secretly monitored using one of his multiple apps, including Auto Forward, Easy Spy, DDI Utilities, Highster Mobile, PhoneSpector, Surepoint, or TurboSpy.These surveillance apps enabled Hinchy's customers to secretly monitor what other individuals were doing on their mobile devices, including location, browsing history, call logs, text messages, photos and videos, email activity, WhatsApp and Skype chats, and social media activity.The stalkerware ads were also used to trick customers into believing that spying was legal even though installing such software on someone else's device without consent violates numerous state and federal laws.Snooping on a partner's phone without consent isn’t just a sign of an unhealthy relationship, it's against the law.\nToday, we stopped several companies from illegally promoting products that allowed spying on:\nCalls and texts\nPhotos and videos\nEmails and social media\"Snooping on a partner and tracking their cell phone without their knowledge isn't just a sign of an unhealthy relationship, it is against the law,\" Attorney General James said.\"These apps and products put New Yorkers at risk of stalking and domestic abuse, and were aggressively promoted by Patrick Hinchy through 16 different companies.\"Today's agreement will block these companies from allowing New Yorkers to be monitored without their awareness, and will continue our ongoing fight to protect New Yorkers' rights, safety, and privacy.\"This happened three years after an August 2018 data breach caused by an unprotected Amazon S3 bucket containing several terabytes of data harvested from over 3,600 devices."

It has also removed support for full DOM capture and enforces Google SSO login to improve account security.Regarding the deprecation of the old service, Mandatory told The Daily Swig that he had become “increasingly uncomfortable with the amount of vulnerability information stored in the service.“Ideally I’d like to be storing zero vulnerability information for XSS hunter users, which this deprecation will achieve,” he said.Mandatory described Truffle Security’s fork as “a step in the right direction” and said: “I think the fact that Truffle Security is starting out with an eye on balancing privacy and bug bounty research interests is a good sign.”“We saw an opportunity to both address privacy concerns as well as give the cybersecurity community new capabilities within the XSS Hunter tool,” Ayrey said.Ayrey said Mandatory was supportive of the effort and helped out in the process. Truffle Security plans to add more features to XSS Hunter in the future, including adding a more complete version of TruffleHog.“When I first built the service many people didn’t really believe that blind XSS was a ‘real’ concern,” he said. “Today I don’t think anyone doubts the pervasiveness and severity of these vulnerabilities, so it has pretty much achieved what it was meant to do.”Burp SuiteVulnerabilitiesCustomersCompanyInsights© 2023 PortSwigger Ltd."

      "text": " A new Android banking trojan has set its eyes on Brazilian financial institutions to commit fraud by leveraging the PIX payments platform.Italian cybersecurity company Cleafy, which discovered the malware between the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, is tracking it under the name PixPirate.It is also the latest addition in a long list of Android banking malware to abuse the operating system's accessibility services API to carry out its nefarious functions, including disabling Google Play Protect, intercepting SMS messages, preventing uninstallation, and serving rogue ads via push notifications.Besides stealing passwords entered by users on banking apps, the threat actors behind the operation have leveraged code obfuscation and encryption using a framework known as Auto.js to resist reverse engineering efforts.The dropper apps used to deliver PixPirate come under the garb of authenticator apps. There are no indications that the apps were published to the official Google Play Store.\"The introduction of ATS capabilities paired with frameworks that will help the development of mobile applications, using flexible and more widespread languages (lowering the learning curve and development time), could lead to more sophisticated malware that, in the future, could be compared with their workstation counterparts,\" the researchers said.The development also comes as Cyble shed light on a new Android remote access trojan codenamed Gigabud RAT targeting users in Thailand, Peru, and the Philippines since at least July 2022 by masquerading as bank and government apps.The web inject modules, mainly used for harvesting credentials and sensitive data, are designed to single out banking, mobile payment services, cryptocurrency exchanges, and mobile e-commerce applications spanning Asia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas.The technique entails employing social engineering methods such as approaching victims through dating apps like Tinder to entice them into downloading fraudulent investment apps with the goal of stealing their money.The malicious iOS apps in question are Ace Pro and MBM_BitScan, both of which have since been removed by Apple. An Android version of MBM_BitScan has also been taken down by Google.Cybersecurity firm Sophos, which made the discovery, said the iOS apps featured a \"review evasion technique\" that enabled the malware authors to get past the vetting process.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "title": "Operation Ice Breaker Targets The Gam(bl)ing Industry Right Before It's Biggest Gathering",
      "text": " Since this is a new threat actor, we are tracking it as Ice Breaker APT. Although research is still ongoing, we are releasing this article to reveal the attacker's Modus Operandi, attack chain, ways to mitigate the threat and supported IOCs, TTPs and Yara.\"Ice Breaker is using a very specific social engineering technique that somewhat sacrifices their identity\", said Senior Threat Researcher, Felipe Duarte.Although we haven't yet discovered Ice Breaker's whereabouts or preferred language, we are still interested in sharing the information we have with infosec community and the IT security of the gambling/gaming industry, as we are approaching the ICE London conference in February. This is the industry's largest conference in the world, hosting over 35,000 people. Our aim is to block the campaign while still researching more about its maker, Ice Breaker.The name \"Ice Breaker\" was born from the name of the main conference of this industry, \"ICE\", and the proximity of the campaign to its starting date, February 6th, 2023.Social engineering prior to sending malicious links to hide executables is a clever tactic, as this threat actor was well-aware of the fact that the customer service is human-operated. Without proper guidance for the teams on the other end, it almost seemed logical that an unregistered user would be having trouble logging in or registering, and thus the attacker sends links to images instead of embedding them in the chat.Convincing the human operator to open the ZIP or LNK file, the threat actor was only steps away from harvesting credentials, open a reverse shell and start the 2nd stage of the attack. Out of four incidents we've investigated, only one used DropBox as trusted downloader link. It was an option the attacker didn't choose initially, but following his frustration over transcripts of the conversation, when his screenshot lure did not follow through he had no other choice. The main payload they chose was something that hadn't been documented before. In this blog post, our team reveals pieces from the investigations to share the complexity of the 2nd stage, involving Node.js compiled binaries (.jsc) which are embedded in the malware executable and are being decoded at run-time. We were able to find the tool that is responsible for generating the bytecode of the .jsc, called Bytenode. As far as we know, generating a malware using this technique is easy; however, reverse engineering this bytecode back to the original source code is highly complex. While our team keeps researching ways to reverse engineer the bytecode, we are sharing this information with the infosec community in an attempt to gain more understanding into the process of creating that malware.It is important to highlight that many operators in the gaming/gambling industry provide support to their clients via dedicated channels handled by them, or in some cases they outsource this operation to specialized companies (BPOs) in an attempt to reduce the operational costs. Depending on the nature of this customer-business relationship, there are several risks associated that we cannot leave aside, and this is exactly what this APT actor is trying to exploit here.According to the infection attempts we've investigated, this attack vector could result in major damage if not properly protected and company's personnel not being trained to act against such scenarios and report immediately to security staff.The Modus Operadi of the attacker is to pretend to be a customer of the website with an issue, such logging in or registering, when in reality the \"visitor\" does not have an account. This should be the first indicator that something is not right.Based on the evidence collected by our team, it seems that all of the individuals carrying out the attacks are not English speakers, who intentionally choose to speak with non-native English customer service representatives, probably to reduce their chances of being detected as scams. As an example, in one of the incidents handled by our team, the attacker even asks for a Spanish speaker, and when approached with one, he immediately changes back to broken English.Incident #1 - Pretending to have a registration issue.Incident #2: The attacker chooses the French language in the customer service portal and shares links to ZIP files supposedly containing images. The proxy from which the attacker is connecting appears to be located in Japan. Incident #3: The attacker is requesting a Spanish-speaking agent, but continues to speak in English. In this example, it is easy to pick up the IDN Homograph Attack.Looking at the intrusions of this threat actor from the outside, without going into the details, we are dealing with a fairly simple control flow.The control flow consists of only two stages, each one with a clear objective.The threat actor is distributing two different types of payloads to the victim during the conversation. According to the data we have, the LNK file is the primary payload and it is the first one presented to the customer service agent. The VBS file, on the other hand, is only shared as a backup option in case the agent is unable to open the first file. Depending on the malicious file executed by the victim, either the LNK or the VBS, a different payload is provided. If the victim executes the LNK downloader, it will fetch and execute an additional MSI package containing an IceBreaker Backdoor, which is a new threat has not been previously described, as far as we know, in any other publicly available threat intelligence report. However, if the victim executes the VBS downloader, it will fetch the infamous Houdini RAT, a VBS-based Remote Access Trojan that has been active at least since since 2013. The threat actor is distributing LNK files via a set of domain names that mimic the legitimate domain \"screenshot[.]net\". Once the victim accesses it, the website presents a very simple view to download the allegedly \"screenshot\", in an attempt to deceive the customer service agent to download the malicious content (see Figure below).Once the customer service agent downloaded the decoy file supposedly to be the screenshot reported by the threat actor in the conversation, he/she was required to unzip its content and run the extracted LNK file on the machine. To make the threat more convincing to the victim, the icon of this Windows Shortcut was changed to match the default Windows picture icon, as shown in the image below.The purpose of the LNK file is fairly simple to understand, it downloads an additional MSI payload from its C2 server by abusing the trusted Windows binary msiexec.exe. Below, an example of the command executed by a malicious LNK file is provided, in it, it is also clear the attempt to impersonate one more time the official website screenshot[.]net by abusing some characters of the Unicode standard. The arguments in the command line are the following:/i : this argument is used to specify that the installer should perform an install operation./passive : this argument is used to display progress bar only, it does not prompt the user with any user interface./quiet : this argument runs the installer in quiet mode, with no user interaction./qn : this argument is used to run the installer with no user interface.Once that file was launched, our team was able to capture the execution flow, isolate the machine and begin the investigation. Having the knowledge of that user belonging to customer service immediately triggered a suspicion that this executable's origin is from an external service. The string that will contain the URL of the malicious server is initialize. It contains the \"http://\" string and some random data that will be removed later.The request object that will be used later to submit the data to the malicious server is initialized, and the malicious URL is completed. It contains the IP address of the malicious server hardcoded in an octal representation.The \"User-Agent\" header is set to the local time of the infected machine.The response of the server is gotten and executed. Once the connection has been established, it sends a POST request to an IP address converted in Octal which represents the value 178[.]63[.]65[.]51.Two different payloads are being used by this treat actor during the second stage of the attack. Among them only one stood out because it implements several techniques never seen before, in a public available report. We provide the details of each threat found during the investigation in the following subsections.Only when the victim downloaded and executed the secondary payload distributed during the conversation with the attacker, this threat is launched. The threat found during our research matches perfectly the behavior described by Mandiant in their report, the only difference is the C2 hardcoded in the script, which in this case was set to 194[.]5[.]97[.]17, as presented in the following picture.The MSI file downloaded and executed by the Windows shortcut is the starting point of this second stage. If the reader wants to follow the analysis of this threat, the details below could be used to download it from the OSINT platform of his/her preference.  The only relevant file inside this MSI package is a CAB archive, which acts as a second layer of protection and contains a compressed version of the malicious backdoor. The installer extracts this archive to the Temp folder, and finally, the third layer of the attack is executed.It doesn't really matter what modifications are made to the MSI package; its purpose is always the same: to drop and execute an embedded PE file called \"Port.exe.\" This embedded resource is the most interesting part of the attack. It is a PE file written in C++ and compiled for 64-bit systems. Its size is larger than the average malware sample typically handled by our team, and it contains many references to Node.js, including but not limited to its icon, several strings, and additional software properties.After a close inspection, something unusual was found in the overlay of this file. To clarify, the overlay of a PE file is a portion of data that is appended to the end of the original executable. This data is not loaded automatically by Windows when the file is executed because it is outside the PE structure. However, it is a fast and easy way to add additional resources required by the software without affecting the structure of the PE.Storing data in the overlay is not inherently malicious, but it is a technique commonly used by threat actors to:Bypass signature-based detectors by easily changing the hash of a PE file without modifying its structure or functionality.Make the process of analyzing the file more difficult by dramatically increasing the size of the file with random data, making it harder for analysis tools to handle.Hide additional resources such as other PE files and binaries that will be loaded during the execution of the file, particularly in droppers and packers.In this case, however, a very characteristic structure was found in the overlay. It wasn't just random data or highly obfuscated binaries that were left there by a packer or dropper. In this case, we were dealing with something additional: a type of binary data used by the JavaScript engine to speed up the parsing process of JavaScript code.Several attempts have been made to decompile this kind of code, but there is still a lack of tools that can keep up with these developments. In fact, based on our research, we have identified only two different projects that try to tackle this challenge using two different perspectives. According to our research, we found:None of the solutions above are suitable for analyzing this sample because they are incompatible with the Node.js version found in the samples (above 8.16.0). Our researchers are currently conducting additional analyses to address this issue and to help the community deal with this type of threat. However, we still obtained relevant results about the capabilities of the malicious JSC artifact by looking at its strings after extracting its contents from the overlay. As seen in the image below, which contains a snippet of the compiled JavaScript extracted from the sample, there are several strings that give us an idea about the scope of the malicious actions that this sample could execute on an infected machine.Based on the abovementioned, we concluded that we are dealing with a new modular backdoor written completely in Node.js and provides threat actors with a set of functionalities such as: Customization via plugins that extend the build-in features of the threat.Process discovery.Steal passwords and cookies from the local storage. It particularly targets Google Chrome.Persistence is achieved by creating a new LNK file in the startup folder \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\WINN.lnk\".Exfiltrate files to the remote server via web sockets.Run custom VBS scripts in the infected machine.Take screenshots from the victim's machine.Generate remote shell sessions.All these capabilities in addition to the very low detection rate of the payload, which during this investigation, has remained close to zero even after 3 months of its first report (see image below), are the perfect recipe for the success of this threat actor. We are currently tracking this tool as the IceBreaker Backdoor, and we continue researching it to help community understand, identify and effectively respond against this new threat.We provide the following set of ideas to the infosec community in an attempt to help hunting this threat on your environments, feel free to test them and improve them if required.Look for LNK files created in the startup folder, and specially search for the name WINN.lnk.Look for any unauthorized execution of the open-source tool tsocks.exe in your environment. You can hunt this by looking for new processes created with that name or following the structure of the commands used by this tool. Monitor closely the creation of msiexec.exe processes receiving URLs as parameters.Monitor closely the execution of VBS scripts and LNK files launched from the Temp folder.

      "title": "Scammers managed to slip crypto apps onto Apple, Google app stores",
      "text": " Scammers were able to get two fraudulent apps onto the app stores run by both Google and Apple that allowed them to push users into making fake cryptocurrency investments, according to a new report. Researchers from Sophos said they discovered Ace Pro and MBM_BitScan on both Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store. The apps are part of a scheme – now known colloquially as “pig butchering” – where scammers develop a relationship with victims, get them to download an app and then eventually get them to deposit money onto the app.Jagadeesh Chandraiah, senior threat researcher at Sophos, said in one case, the scammers created a fake profile of a woman living a lavish life in London. They developed a relationship with a victim and urged them to download the Ace Pro app – which masquerades as a QR code scanner.But once the app is downloaded, users see a fraudulent crypto trading platform that urges them to deposit currency. All of the funds deposited go directly to the scammers. One victim that contacted Sophos only discovered the apps were fraudulent after losing $4,000.Chandraiah said it was most surprising that the apps made it onto Apple’s App Store considering how hard it generally is to get malware past the company’s security review process. While other malicious apps have been found on the Play Store, this is the first time Sophos found fraudulent apps on Apple’s store in their two years examining pig butchering scams.Scammers previously had to go through far more technical trouble to get Apple users to download fake apps, and many victims figured out something was wrong when they couldn't simply download an app directly. “By getting an application onto the App Store, the scammers have vastly increased their potential victim pool, particularly since most users inherently trust Apple,” Chandraiah said. “Both apps are also not affected by iOS’ new Lockdown mode, which prevents scammers from loading mobile profiles helpful for social engineering. In fact, these CryptoRom scammers may be shifting their tactics—i.e., focusing on bypassing the App Store review process—in light of the security features in Lockdown.” But once the app was approved, the scammers were able to redirect it to a domain registered in an unnamed country in Asia. The other app, MBM_BitScan, is known as BitScan on Google Play and both apps communicate with the same Command and Control (C2) infrastructure which communicates with a server that resembles a legitimate Japanese crypto firm. Both Google and Apple were notified by Sophos about the apps and both companies said they removed them. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. A Google spokesperson told The Record: “The Android app identified as malicious in the report has been removed from Google Play and the developer has been banned.\"Sophos was initially alerted to the scam apps by victims, kicking off their two-year investigation into the trend. “Pig butchering” scams have become wildly popular among cybercriminals as online dating has exploded and more people have become comfortable with sending money digitally. “CryptoRom and other forms of “pig butchering” initially targeted people in China and Taiwan. Early scams focused on online gambling with insider information, using similar tactics to CryptoRom. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scams expanded globally and evolved into fraudulent foreign exchange and cryptocurrency trading. We are tracking this threat actor as the ‘ShaZhuPan’ group,” Chandraiah said. “When Chinese authorities started cracking down on these scams and prosecuted some perpetrators, some of the gangs behind them fled to smaller southeast Asian countries, including Cambodia, where they now operate in special economic zones (SEZ).”Many – being trafficked from countries like India, China and Malaysia – had their passports confiscated and were forced to work for these operations to get their passports back. They are given scripts to follow when approaching victims and instructions on how to get victims to send money. Sophos noted that while it may seem far-fetched that anyone would fall for these scams, the victims they spoke to were almost always well-educated. Most victims noted that their relationships with the scammers lasted months and that they were allowed to make small profits from their initial transactions on the fraudulent financial websites or apps. Many of the scammers also share fake screenshots of the money they are purportedly making from the fraudulent platforms. Most of the victims who spoke to Sophos said they had recently dealt with a major life change and were emotionally vulnerable to this kind of operation, where scammers contacted them daily and shared mundane life updates.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " An ongoing Google ads malvertising campaign is spreading malware installers that leverage KoiVM virtualization technology to evade detection when installing the Formbook data stealer.KoiVM is a plugin for the ConfuserEx .NET protector that obfuscates a program's opcodes so that the virtual machine only understands them. Then, when launched, the virtual machine translates the opcodes back to their original form so that the application can be executed.\"Virtualization frameworks such as KoiVM obfuscate executables by replacing the original code, such as NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instructions, with virtualized code that only the virtualization framework understands,\" explains a new report by SentinelLabs.\"A virtual machine engine executes the virtualized code by translating it into the original code at runtime.\"\"When put to malicious use, virtualization makes malware analysis challenging and also represents an attempt to evade static analysis mechanisms.\"Sentinel Labs comments that while KoiVM virtualization is popular for hacking tools and cracks, it is seldom used in malware distribution.Instead, the security firm believes the new trend in its use might be one of the multiple side effects of Microsoft's disabling of macros in Office.In the ongoing campaign seen by SentinelLabs, threat actors push the MalVirt loaders in ads pretending to be for the Blender 3D software.The downloads offered by these fake sites utilize invalid digital signatures impersonating Microsoft, Acer, DigiCert, Sectigo, and AVG Technologies USA.While these invalid signatures will not trick Windows into showing them as signed, the MalVirt loaders still pack features to avoid detection.\"For example, some samples patch the AmsiScanBuffer function implemented in amsi.dll to bypass the Anti Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) that detects malicious PowerShell commands,\" explains researcher A. Milenkoski.\"Further, in an attempt to evade static detection mechanisms, some strings (such as amsi.dll and AmsiScanBuffer) are Base-64 encoded and AES-encrypted.\"The loaders can also detect if they run in a virtualized environment by querying specific registry keys, and if they do, the execution stops to evade analysis.MalVirt also uses a signed Microsoft Process Explorer driver loaded at system start-up as \"TaskKill,\" enabling it to modify running processes to dodge detection.To also evade the decompilation of the virtualized code, the loaders also use a modified version of KoiVM that features additional obfuscation layers, making its decyphering even more challenging.SentinelLabs says this custom KoiVM implementation confuses standard devirtualization frameworks like the 'OldRod' by obfuscating its routine through arithmetic operations instead of using straightforward assignments.Milenkoski says it's possible to defeat the obfuscation in these MalVirt loaders and restore the original order of KoiVM's 119 constant variables.However, the additional obfuscation makes it difficult, requiring hefty manual labor since existing automated tools cannot help.In addition to all detection avoidance systems used in the malware loader, a new trick is employed by Formbook itself that helps disguise its real C2 (command and control) traffic and IP addresses.The info-stealing malware mixes its real traffic with various \"smokescreen\" HTTP requests whose content is encrypted and encoded so they don't stand out.The malware communicates with those IPs randomly, picking them out of a hardcoded list with domains hosted by various companies.SentinelLabs says that in the samples it analyzed, it saw Formbook communicating with 17 domains, only one of which was the actual C2 server, and the rest serving as mere decoys to confuse network traffic monitoring tools.This is a novel system on a pretty old malware strain, indicating that its operators are interested in empowering it with new features that will make it better at staying hidden from security tools and analysts.Whether or not threat actors have completely switched malspam distribution of Formbook to Google search advertisements remains to be seen, but it's another example that users need to be very careful of the links they click in search results."

      "text": " Data-storage hardware vendor QNAP is warning customers to update their devices after the discovery of a vulnerability that exposes thousands to attacks. “The vulnerability is not actively exploited now,” a spokesperson for QNAP told The Record.The bug was discovered by a third-party researcher and reported through the company's Security Bounty Program, the spokesperson said.“Censys has observed 67,415 hosts with indications of running a QNAP-based system; unfortunately, we could only obtain the version number from 30,520 hosts. But, if the advisory is correct, over 98% of identified QNAP devices would be vulnerable to this attack,” Censys senior security researcher Mark Ellzey said. “We found that of the 30,520 hosts with a version, only 557 were running QuTS Hero greater than or equal to ‘h5.0.1.2248’ or QTS greater than or equal to ‘5.0.1.2234,’ meaning 29,968 hosts could be affected by this vulnerability.”The country with the most vulnerable hosts was the United States, which had more than 3,200. Italy, Taiwan, Germany and Japan were not far behind. Mark Ellzey, senior security researcher at Censys, told The Record on Friday that the number of vulnerable devices moved up to 31,567.\"There is good reason for this; most of these devices live on residential networks (a residential network is an ISP that people use in their homes, (FIOS, Comcast, etc),\" he said. \"For example, HINET Data Communications provides broadband services to small businesses and local residents. HINET saw 322 new QNAP devices come online. Networks like these are the networks of normal everyday people, not high-availability server farms, so you're going to see an ebb and flow of listening services as people log in and log out of their internet.\"\"There is no indication of Deadbolt infections so far -- but given that the group was targeting QNAP devices before, there is a decent chance they are working on finding this vulnerability now,\" Ellzey said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " “One of the victims was in the health care research vertical within India. In recent years the Indian research and technology sector has been a common target of those North Korean threat groups with a focus on intelligence collection,” the researchers said. “Other victims of this campaign identified by WithSecure included health care research, a manufacturer of technology used in energy, research, defense, and health care verticals, as well as the chemical engineering department of a leading research university.”The researchers named the campaign “No Pineapple” due to an error message that was found in the code of a backdoor tool found during their investigation. The hackers used the bugs to gain access to a Zimbra mail server at the end of August 2022 and likely exfiltrated the contents of the mailboxes. By October 2022, the group moved laterally to another vulnerable device on the network and used malware to eventually steal 100 GB of data on November 5. Despite the massive amounts of data stolen, the group never took destructive actions while in the victim network.The researchers attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group based on the malware used and several operational mistakes made by the group during their intrusion. The infrastructure used by the group during the attack has been tied to previous Lazarus campaigns identified by other security companies.“The overall toolkit of the threat actor is very similar to other reported instances of North Korean groups,” the researchers said. “The usage of Dtrack and Grease malware has been previously associated with Kimsuky, while Dtrack is also in the Lazarus arsenal. The toolkit aligns with other reporting of this campaign from Talos Intelligence and Symantec.”The researchers were also able to tie the activity to North Korea based on the hours of operation, noting that most of the actions took place between 00:00 to 15:00 UTC (09:00 and 21:00 UTC +9) and between Monday and Saturday – a work pattern common for those in North Korea. They also found connections to a North Korea IP address that WithSecure concluded was “an operational security failure by the threat actor.”“This is significant as the only North Korean IP addresses are three /24 networks which are directly controlled and used by the North Korean government, and as such it is extremely likely that this activity was initiated by a North Korean state actor,” they said. WithSecure said Lazarus group operates within the 3rd Bureau of North Korean People’s Army – a unit tasked with intelligence gathering and technological/commercial espionage.The report on the incident also notes that there is significant overlap in the tools used by different hacking groups within the North Korean military. The attack used tools typically deployed by Kimsuky – a group attributed to North Korea’s 5th Bureau that focuses on hacking targets in South Korea – as well as APT37 which is based within the Ministry of State Security and also focuses on South Korea. Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Security researchers warn that hackers may start using Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) more often as method to achieve persistence and execute code on a target machine via malicious Office add-ins.The technique is an alternative to sneaking into documents VBA macros that fetch malware from an external source. However, using VSTO introduce an attack vector that allows building .NET-based malware and embedding it into the Office add-in.VSTO is a software development kit, part of Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE. It is used to build VSTO add-ins, which are extensions for Office applications that can execute code on the machine.These add-ins can be packaged with the document files or downloaded from a remote location and are executed when launching the document with the associated Office app (e.g. Word, Excel)Threat actors prefer using the local VSTO approach, which does not require bypassing trust-related security mechanisms to execute the add-in code. However, Deep Instinct noticed some attacks using remote VSTO add-ins.A sign of these payload-carrying documents is the presence of a \"custom.xml\" parameter that gives the Office application instructions on where to locate the add-in and to install it.The dependencies of the add-in payload are stored together with the document, typically inside an ISO container. The threat actors set these extra files to \"hidden,\" hoping that the victim misses them and assumes the archive only contains a document.After launching the document, a prompt appears asking to install the add-in. Attackers can trick the victim to allow the action in a similar way as with the \"enable content\" pop-up for enabling malicious VBA macros to execute.In one attack that Deep Instinct saw targeting users in Spain, the add-in payload executed an encoded and compressed PowerShell script on the computer.In another example that involved a remote VSTO-based add-in, the threat actors set the .DLL payload to download a password-protected ZIP archive and drop it into the \"%\\AppData\\Local\\ folder.\" Deep Instinct could not retrieve the final payload due to the server being offline at the time of its investigation.Deep Instinct researchers expect more threat actors to integrate VSTO into their attacks. They believe that \"nation-state and other 'high caliber' actors\" will jump at the opportunity as they are more likely to have the means to bypass trust mechanism used in Windows by using valid code signing certificates."

      "text": " Nearly $4 billion was stolen in cyberattacks on cryptocurrency platforms in 2022, fueled in large part by hackers working on behalf of the North Korean government. Chainalysis researchers told The Record that hackers especially targeted cross-chain bridge protocols – tools that let users port their cryptocurrency from one blockchain to another. Of the $3.1 billion stolen from DeFi platforms, 64% came from cross-chain bridge protocols.“These events target the sinew between blockchains and DeFi projects, and often, they successfully compromise hundreds of millions of USD equivalent value,” they said.Hackers with North Korea’s Lazarus Group and others were responsible for $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency theft in 2022, shattering their own records. Chainalysis noted that in 2020, the country’s total exports were just $142 million, making the crypto hacks a “sizable chunk of the nation’s economy.”Following the sanctions, Chainalysis found that North Korean actors began to diversify their use of mixing services. While some funds are still laundered through Tornado Cash, the country’s hackers also use services like Sinbad, a relatively new Bitcoin mixer.“As we’ve seen in many North Korea-directed hacks, the hackers bridge the stolen funds from the Ethereum blockchain — including a portion of the funds stolen in the Axie Infinity hack — to Bitcoin, then send that Bitcoin to Sinbad,” Chainalysis researchers said. In December and January, North Korea-linked hackers sent $24.2 million worth of Bitcoin to Sinbad. The researchers said there is no indication that cryptocurrency hacks will slow down in 2023. “However, over time we hope to see hacking decrease not just as it becomes more difficult to steal funds, but also launder and cash them out, given the transparency of the blockchain,” they said.“Similar to how our industry came together after the endless hacking of centralized exchanges in 2019, we need to do the same in DeFi. Given the losses and the promise of DeFi as an antidote to some of the shortcomings that lead to the collapse of FTX, I believe we’ll see a great deal of collaboration and progress in this space.”The report from Chainalysis coincided with a hack on a cryptocurrency platform named BonqDAO, in which $120 million was allegedly stolen.Blockchain research firm PeckShield confirmed to The Record that they believe $98 million worth of the Bonq Euro (BEUR) coin and $11 million in AllianceBlock (ALBT) coin was stolen.

      "text": " A new cyber espionage campaign dubbed 'No Pineapple!' has been attributed to the North Korean Lazarus hacking group, allowing the threat actors to stealthily steal 100GB of data from the victim without causing any destruction.The campaign lasted between August and November 2022, targeting organizations in medical research, healthcare, chemical engineering, energy, defense, and a leading research university.WithSecure was able to attribute the activity based on multiple pieces of evidence but also noticed some new developments for Lazarus, like:The campaign is named after the '< No Pineapple! >' error seen transmitted by a remote access malware when uploading stolen data to the threat actor's servers.The Lazarus hackers compromised the victim's network on August 22nd, 2022, by leveraging the CVE-2022-27925 (remote code execution) and CVE-2022-37042 (authentication bypass) Zimbra vulnerabilities to drop a webshell on the target's mail server.After successfully breaching the network, the hackers deployed the tunneling tools 'Plink and '3Proxy' to create reverse tunnels back to the threat actors' infrastructure, allowing the threat actors to bypass the firewall.Less than a week after, WithSecure says the intruders began utilizing modified scripts to extract approximately 5GB of email messages from the server and save them to a locally stored CSV file, which was later uploaded to the attacker's server.Over the next two months, the threat actors spread laterally through the network, acquiring administrator credentials and stealing data from devices.While spreading through the network, Lazarus deployed multiple custom tools, such as Dtrack and what is believed to be a new version of the GREASE malware, used to locate Windows administrator accounts.Dtrack is an information-stealing backdoor known to be used by Lazarus, while the GREASE malware is associated with Kimusky, another North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.The attack culminated on November 5th, 2022, with the actors lurking in the network for over two months and ultimately stealing 100GB of data from the compromised organization. WithSecure was able to analyze the work patterns of the threat actors, stating that they worked Monday through Saturday from 9 AM to 10 PM.\"Time zone attribution analysis concluded that the time zone aligns with UTC +9. Reviewing activity by time of day finds that most threat actor activity occurred between 00:00 to 15:00 UTC (09:00 and 21:00 UTC +9),\" shared WithSecure.\"Analysing activity by day of the week suggests that the threat actor was active Monday to Saturday, a common work pattern for DPRK.\"The first notable change found in this Lazarus campaign is that they now rely solely on IP addresses without domain names for their infrastructure.This change has advantages for the threat actors, including reduced need for renewal maintenance and greater IP flexibility.Instead, it relies on a separate backdoor to transfer the data it has gathered locally on the compromised machine, storing them in a password-protected archive.\"The staging and exfiltration host was likely carefully chosen by the threat actor to be a host where endpoint security monitoring tools were not deployed,\" explains WithSecure in the report.Its main difference compared to previous versions is that it now uses RDPWrap to install an RDP service onto the host to create a privileged user account with the help of net user commands.WithSecure's investigation of retrieved network logs from the victim revealed that one of the web shells planted by the intruders was communicating with a North Korean IP address (\"175.45.176[.]27\").This isolated incident occurred at the beginning of that day, preceded by connections from a proxy address, indicating that the threat actor likely exposed themselves by an error at the start of their workday.Additionally, WithSecure observed that various commands executed on the breached network devices were very similar to those hardcoded inside Lazarus malware but often contained mistakes and didn't execute, indicating that the threat actors were typing them manually using the Impacket 'atexec' module.Apart from the mistakes, WithSecure was able to link these operations to Lazarus based on TTP overlaps detailed in previous reports by Symantec and Cisco Talos, the employed malware strains, the profiles of the targets, infrastructure overlaps, and time-zone analysis.WithSecure's report is another indication of Lazarus' activity, with the threat group continuing its efforts to gather intelligence and exfiltrate large amounts of data from high-profile victims."

It was found and reported by security researchers Sam Quinn and Kasimir Schulz with the Trellix Advanced Research Center.Successful exploitation in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction enables remote authenticated threat actors to execute commands with root permissions on the underlying operating system.The company says the vulnerability affects Cisco devices running IOS XE software, but only if they don't support native docker.Besides IOS XE-based devices configured with IOx, the list of impacted devices also includes 800 Series Industrial ISR routers, CGR1000 compute modules, IC3000 industrial compute gateways, IR510 WPAN industrial routers, and Cisco Catalyst access points (COS-APs).The company also confirmed that the CVE-2023-20076 flaw doesn't affect Catalyst 9000 Series switches, IOS XR and NX-OS software, or Meraki products.Attackers can only exploit this vulnerability if they have authenticated administrative access to the vulnerable systems.However, the Trellix researchers explained that threat actors exploit other security flaws allowing privilege escalation, or can use various tactics to obtain admin credentials.For instance, to gain admin access to the targeted devices, they can use:\"Side-stepping this security measure means that if an attacker exploits this vulnerability, the malicious package will keep running until the device is factory reset or until it is manually deleted.\"This is possible because the command injection enables bypassing mitigations put in place by Cisco to prevent vulnerability persistence between system reboots or system resets.Cisco's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) says it found no evidence that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild."

      "text": " Scammers used a malicious DocuSign document in a campaign that tried to steal credentials belonging to more than 10,000 people across several organizations. Researchers at cybersecurity company Armorblox said the brand impersonation campaign targeted Microsoft Office 365 email accounts and managed to bypass other security tools. The subject of the emails was “Please DocuSign: Approve Document 2023-01-11” in an attempt to make victims think the email was urgent and needed to be opened as soon as possible. While the email address and domain name had no association with DocuSign, the scammers were relying on the fact that it can be hard to see these names – particularly on mobile devices where many people typically read their emails. The researchers noted that DocuSign attacks are particularly successful for scammers because people are used to getting these kinds of emails before and after signing documents through the platform. “The language used within the body of the email continues to impersonate the well-known brand DocuSign,” the researchers said. “Through the inclusion of statements around alternate shipping methods, a blurb about the company DocuSign, and even a disclaimer to not share this email with anybody else, unsuspecting victims who fell for the attackers’ manipulating tactics and opened the email would have been presented with additional language and information aimed to establish trust in the victims and encourage he or she to click on the main link that reads: VIEW COMPLETED DOCUMENT.”The goal of the email was to get users to click on the button, which would take them to a fake landing page that impersonated cybersecurity firm Proofpoint. The page had Proofpoint branding and a PDF icon urging the person to clock on the document in order to view it. The landing page had several hallmarks of legitimacy, including a fake checkmark resembling verification from cybersecurity company Symantec and even the inclusion of the person’s email address. The goal was to get people to enter their credentials for Proofpoint. Armorblox did not say if any of the emails were successful, but the campaign builds on a longstanding trend of hackers using platforms like DocuSign to manipulate people into handing over valuable credentials. “There's a good chance that most recipients have had professional or personal interaction with those services. Although PDF and HTML attachments were very common, the top phishing vector was still a rogue URL link in an email,” said KnowBe4’s Roger Grimes.“Users need to always hover over any links embedded in any email and examine it for legitimacy before clicking on it. Fake HR, human resource, requests were also a top clicked simulated phishing topic, accounting for nearly a third of all clicked phishing tests.” Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Pro-Russian hacktivist group Killnet this week launched distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on networks belonging to 14 major US hospitals in its continuing retaliation campaign against entities in countries the threat actor perceives as hostile to Russian interests in Ukraine.The attacks — like most Killnet attacks since Russia's invasion last February — appear to have done little to seriously disrupt network operations at any of the targeted organizations, which included Stanford Health, Michigan Medicine, Duke Health, and Cedars-Sinai.That said, they are likely going to garner Killnet more support from other like-minded hacktivists in Russia and elsewhere, and possibly even fuel investments into its operations from others, making them more dangerous in the process, security experts said this week.\"Killnet has been actively attacking anyone who supports Ukraine or goes against Russia for almost 12 months now,\" says Pascal Geenens, director of threat intelligence at Radware. \"They have been dedicated to their cause and have had the time to build experience and increase their circle of influence across affiliate pro-Russian hacktivist groups.\"Killnet's latest DDoS campaign this week against hospitals in the US and medical institutions in multiple other countries, including Germany, Poland, and the UK, were likely motivated by the recent US-led decision by NATO countries to send battle tanks to Ukraine. However, the impact of these attacks remains questionable.Mary Masson, director of public relations at Michigan Medicine, for instance, says Killnet's DDoS attacks hit multiple of its websites on Jan. 30, including uofmhealth.org and mottchildren.org. Masson describes the attacks as causing \"intermittent problems\" for some of Michigan Medicine's public-facing websites hosted by a third-party service provider. \"None of the sites impacted contain patient information, and all patient information is safe,\" she notes. \"Patients were always still able to access the patient portal via myuofmhealth.org.\" The websites were all back to almost normal operations a day later, on Jan. 31.Sally Stewart, associate director of media relations at Cedars-Sinai, describes Killnet's DDoS attack as having a similarly low impact on the hospital's operations: \"The Cedars-Sinai website experienced a brief service interruption early Monday morning that has resolved. The website remains fully functional,\" Stewart said in an emailed statement to Dark Reading.Stanford Healthcare and Duke Health did not immediately respond to Dark Reading's request for comment.\"They are not as disruptive as they claim to be,\" Geenens says, adding that Killnet’s main objective is attracting attention and getting their pro-Russian message heard. \"They go after targets that are visible to the larger public, such as public websites of institutions, governments, and organizations.\" Often the resources the group has targeted are not business-critical. That does not mean the group can be ignored, however. In an advisory following the recent DDoS attacks, the American Hospital Association described Killnet as an active threat to the healthcare industry. Importantly, Killnet's pro-Russian DDoS crusade has also begun attracting many more followers and fans. Daniel Smith, head of cyber-threat intelligence at Radware, says the number of subscribers for @Killnet_reserve on Telegram grew from about 34,000 subscribers to 85,000 subscribers in June 2022. \"Just for comparison, IT Army of Ukraine has over 200,000 subscribers, but has been losing subscribers since March 2022,\" he says.The group has focused quite a bit on publicity via its Telegram channel, which it also uses to encourage followers to conduct DDoS attacks of their own.\"Killnet’s influence, reach, and skills are growing, and they are not showing signs of slowing down or retiring soon,\" Geenens warns.What makes the group now potentially more dangerous are its growing reach and skills, Radware's Smith adds. A few months ago, Radware's assessment of the risk posed by a pro-Russian hacktivist group such as Killnet would have been low, he explains. \"But after 12 months of building their experience,\" he says, \"advancing their tools and growing their social network, I’m more likely to increase that risk to moderate.\"While there's no reason for panic, it is better to err on the side of caution and be prepared. \"Everyone in the security community knows it does not take extremely skilled or sophisticated actors to disrupt or cause impact to an organization or infrastructure,\" Smith adds.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " New stealthy malware designed to hunt down vulnerable Redis servers online has infected over a thousand of them since September 2021 to build a botnet that mines for Monero cryptocurrency.Discovered by Aqua Security researchers Nitzan Yaakov and Asaf Eitani, who dubbed it HeadCrab, the malware has so far ensnared at least 1,200 such servers, which are also used to scan for more targets online.\"We discovered not only the HeadCrab malware but also a unique method to detect its infections in Redis servers. Our method found approximately 1,200 actively infected servers when applied to exposed servers in the wild.\"The threat actors behind this botnet take advantage of the fact that Redis servers don't have authentication enabled by default, as they are designed to be used within an organization's network and shouldn't be exposed to Internet access.If admins don't secure them and accidentally (or intentionally) configure them to be accessible from outside their local network, attackers can easily compromise and hijack them using malicious tools or malware.Once they gain access to servers that don't require authentication, the malicious actors issue a 'SLAVEOF' command to synchronize a master server under their control to deploy the HeadCrab malware onto the newly hijacked system.​After being installed and launched, HeadCrab provides the attackers with all the capabilities required to take complete control of the targeted server and add it to their cryptomining botnet.It also deletes all logs and only communicates to other servers controlled by its masters to evade detection.\"The attacker communicates with legitimate IP addresses, primarily other infected servers, to evade detection and reduce the likelihood of being blacklisted by security solutions,\" the researchers added.\"The malware is primarily based on Redis processes which are unlikely to be flagged as malicious. Payloads are loaded through memfd, memory-only files, and kernel modules are loaded directly from memory, avoiding disk writes.\"While analyzing the malware, they also found that the attackers mainly use mining pools hosted on previously compromised servers to complicate attribution and detection.Furthermore, the Monero wallet linked to this botnet showed that the attackers are raking in an estimated annual profit of around $4,500 per worker, a lot higher than the usual $200/worker similar operations make.To defend their Redis servers, admins are advised to ensure that only clients within their networks can access them, to disable the \"slaveof\" feature if it's unused, and enable protected mode, which configures the instance to only respond to the loopback address and refuse connections from other IP addresses.Update February 03, 10:27 EST: A Redis spokesperson sent the following statement after the article was published:We should note that there are no signs that Redis Enterprise software or Redis Cloud services have been impacted by these attacks."

      "text": " A threat actor named InTheBox is promoting on Russian cybercrime forums an inventory of 1,894 web injects (overlays of phishing windows) for stealing credentials and sensitive data from banking, cryptocurrency exchange, and e-commerce apps.The overlays are compatible with various Android banking malware and mimic apps operated by major organizations used in dozens of countries on almost all continents.Being available in such numbers and at low prices, allows cybercriminals to focus on other parts of their campaigns, development of the malware, and to widen their attack to other regions.Typically, mobile banking trojans check what apps are present on an infected device and pull from the command and control server the web injects corresponding to the apps of interest.When the victim launches a target app, the malware automatically loads the overlay that mimics the interface of the legitimate product.InTheBox provides up-to-date injects for hundreds of apps, researchers at threat intelligence company Cyble discovered.For those who don't want to buy entire packages, InTheBox also sells web injects individually for $30 each. The shop also allows users to order custom injects for any malware.InTheBox's web inject packages include app icon PNGs and an HTML file with JavaScript code that collects the victim's credentials and other sensitive data.In most cases, the injects feature a second overlay that requests the user to enter credit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV numbers.Cyble says that InTheBox's injects can check the validity of the credit card numbers entered by victims using the Luhn algorithm, which helps Android malware operators filter out invalid data.Finally, the stolen data is converted into string value and sent to a server controlled by the operator of the Android banking trojan.InTheBox has been selling web injects for Android malware since February 2020, constantly adding new pages that target more banks and financial apps.Cyble was able to confirm that InTheBox's web injects have been used by the 'Coper' and the 'Alien' Android trojans in 2021 and September 2022, respectively, while the most recent campaign occurred in January 2023 and targeted Spanish banks."

By filtering vulnerable packages in use, companies can focus their efforts on a smaller amount of the fixable vulnerabilities that represent genuine risk.Additionally, the research document suggests that 59% of containers have no CPU limits defined, and 69% of all requested CPU resources typically remain unused, thus resulting in (often) significant overspending for companies.“Looking back at last year’s report, container adoption continues to mature, which is evident by the decrease in container life spans,” said Sysdig director of cybersecurity strategy Michael Isbitski.“However, misconfigurations and vulnerabilities continue to plague cloud environments, and supply chains are amplifying how security problems manifest.”In fact, according to the executive, this prevents organizations from gathering troubleshooting information and reinforces the need for security solutions to retain information despite the temporary nature of the cloud.“Permissions management, for users and services alike, is another area I’d love to see people get stricter about,” Isbitski added.The report analyzed more than seven million containers that Sysdig customers run daily. The company said it also pulled from public data sources like GitHub, Docker Hub and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).Quality-wise, the anonymized data originates from container deployments across a wide range of industries and mid-market-to-large enterprise organizations. The customer data was analyzed across North and South America, Australia, the EU, the UK and Japan.“This year’s report shows great growth and also outlines best practices that I hope teams adopt by the 2024 report, such as looking at in-use exposure to understand real risk and to prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities that are truly impactful,” Isbitski concluded."

They can be abused to inject maliciously crafted files into the operating system of impacted appliances.VMware also fixed a deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2022-31710) which triggers denial of service states, and an information disclosure bug (CVE-2022-31711) that attackers can use to gain access to sensitive session and application info.​\"This vulnerability is easy to exploit however, it requires the attacker to have some infrastructure setup to serve malicious payloads,\" the researchers said.\"Additionally, since this product is unlikely to be exposed to the internet, the attacker likely has already established a foothold somewhere else on the network. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution as root, essentially giving an attacker complete control over the system.\"While there are only a few dozen instances publicly exposed on the internet, according to Shodan data, this is to be expected given that VMware vRealize Log Insight appliances are designed to be accessed from inside an organization's network.However, it's not uncommon for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in already compromised networks for lateral movement, making vulnerable VMware appliances valuable internal targets."

Everyone must upgrade their QNAP devices immediately to be safe from future ransomware campaigns,\" Ellzey added.Besides updating your NAS device ASAP, you should also consider not exposing it online to ensure it's not reachable via the Internet for remote exploitation.Update February 03, 17:33 EST: QNAP updated their advisory today to say that \"QTS 5.0.0, QTS 4.x.x, QuTS hero 5.0.0 and QuTS hero 4.5.x are not affected.\"As a result, Censys also revised its report and now says that the number of NAS devices vulnerable to CVE-2022-27596 exploits is likely much smaller.\"With this new wording, the exposure is less extreme.

To date, the fraudsters have successfully stolen millions of dollars, according to a DomainTools research note.In the end, there are two types of victims in this fraud campaign, says Sean McNee, CTO of DomainTools.\"Obviously the first are the consumers who are tricked into investing their money — often in the millions — then losing it through cryptocurrency and other investment scams,\" he says. \"The second are the financial advisers, whose professional identities are being brazenly impersonated, putting their reputations and credibility at stake, not only today but for future business relationships as well.\"DomainTools also verified that the fraudsters seemingly understood the often-impenetrable subject of personal finance.DomainTools called the investment scam a variant of \"pig butchering\" — the latest term for a romance scam that essentially \"fattens up\" a victim by creating trust through a relationship, which then ends in financial fraud — the \"butchering\" part. The fraudsters used the identities of several hundred financial advisers, deploying a fake website on a custom domains for each identity and using known social media networks to communicate with victims, DomainTools stated.\"While many of these instances start through establishing a relationship — whether romantic, or just friendly — this is the first time we’ve seen such an extensive campaign to build trust with — fake — professional financial advisers,\" McNee says. \"Through our research, we were able to ascertain that the threat actors impersonating the financial advisers showed quite a surprisingly high level of financial expertise, and so were convincing to their victims.\"The details used to impersonate financial advisers appear to have been scraped from regulatory filings posted to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) BrokerCheck and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Investment Adviser Public Disclosure sites.\"These scams rely on slowly building trust with a target — often under the guise of a financial advisor or successful investor — in order to convince targets to invest in a scam, such as a cryptocurrency 'investment,' in which their funds are promptly stolen and rendered nearly impossible to recover,\" DomainTools stated in its research note.The campaign is not just reliant on knowledgeable fraudsters for its success. The scam is also supported by a bulletproof hosting service known as SpeedHost247, DomainTools stated. Serving a wide variety of criminal enterprises, bulletproof-hosting services are a common cybercriminal service that ignores requests for takedowns, uses difficult-to-disrupt cloud architectures, and accepts cryptocurrency to obscure financial transactions.The cluster of financial fraud activities tracked by DomainTools appears to \"share orbits\" with SpeedHost247, which operates out of West Africa, the company's researchers stated. SpeedHost247 has donned the mantle of a legitimate service, showing office buildings and spaces on its website. In reality, the images are modified pictures from other companies' sites, according to DomainTools' analysis.\"Whether SpeedHost247 is an active participant in financial advisor impersonation scams remains an open question,\" DomainTools stated in the analysis, \"but their seeming willingness to accommodate dubious customers who are offering even more dubious financial services using false information, is reason for pause.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

This likely will result in entities Killnet targeted also being hit with ransomware or DDoS attacks as a means of extortion, a tactic several ransomware groups have used,” HHS warned. Swimlane’s Daniel Selig noted that the DDoS incidents took place days after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. would be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukrainian forces. Selig added that last week, several financial organizations, airports and government offices in Germany were targeted in a similar way after their announcement of additional military support for Ukraine. “It goes without saying that cyberattacks on hospitals and medical centers are some of the most dangerous — these attacks have the ability to knock systems offline in their entirety and keep patients from receiving the care that they require,” he said.While DDoS attacks typically do not cause major or lasting damage, they can cause service outages that span several hours or even days.Aleksandr Yampolskiy, CEO of SecurityScorecard, noted that groups like Killnet run popular channels on the Telegram app where they recruit new members and teach other hackers DDoS skills. Killnet’s channel has more than 92,000 subscribers.Groups like Killnet are able to muster so much DDoS traffic in part because they exploit vulnerable devices online. Yampolskiy said Killnet typically target routers from MikroTek that are either misconfigured or vulnerable, and the group also takes advantage of the proliferation of IoT devices across the world. Everything from internet-connected baby cameras to smart refrigerators can be a potential target.

      "text": " OpenAI has released an AI text classifier that attempts to detect whether input content was generated using artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT.\"The AI Text Classifier is a fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources, such as ChatGPT,\" explains a new OpenAI blog post.OpenAI released the tool today after numerous universities and K-12 school districts banned the company's popular ChatGPT AI chatbot due to its ability to complete students' homework, such as writing book reports and essays, and even finishing programming assignments.When testing OpenAI's AI text classifier against most of our own content, it correctly determined a human wrote our articles. As educators will likely use the new AI Text Classifiers to check if students cheated on their homework assignments, OpenAI warns that it should not be used as the \"sole piece of evidence\" for determining academic dishonesty.\"In our evaluations on a 'challenge set' of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as 'likely AI-written,' while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives).\"\"Our classifier's reliability typically improves as the length of the input text increases\"The classifier's success will likely improve as time passes and is trained with further data. For now, though, it is not a reliable tool for detecting AI-generated content."

      "text": " New versions of the Prilex point-of-sale malware can block secure, NFC-enabled contactless credit card transactions, forcing consumers to insert credit cards that are then stolen by the malware.On a payment terminal, contactless transactions use NFC (Near Field Communication) chips embedded in credit cards and mobile devices to conduct close-proximity payments via credit cards, smartphones, or even smartwatches. However, using NFC chips in credit cards has made it harder for point of sale (PoS) malware to steal credit card information, causing threat actors to develop new methods to steal your payment information.Kaspersky, following the Prilex PoS malware closely, reports seeing at least three new variants in the wild, with version numbers 06.03.8070, 06.03.8072, and 06.03.8080, first released in November 2022.These new variants introduce a new feature that prevents payment terminals from accepting contactless transactions, forcing customers to insert their cards.When the new Prilex feature is enabled, it will block contactless transactions and display a \"Contactless error, insert your card\" error on the payment terminal.This forces the victim to finish the transaction by inserting a credit card, making capturing the card information through the payment terminal easier.The malware uses a rule-based file to determine if it should block a transaction based on whether it has detected the use of NFC.Prilex's operators block NFC transactions because those generate a unique ID or card number that's only valid for a single transaction, so if that data is stolen, it wouldn't be helpful for the crooks.After the credit card data is captured, the Prilex operators employ the techniques seen in previous releases, like cryptogram manipulation and \"GHOST transaction\" attacks.Another interesting new feature seen for the first time on the latest Prilex variants is the ability to filter unwanted cards and only capture data from specific providers and tiers.Payees have limited means to protect themselves against PoS malware like Prilex, as there's no way to know if a payment terminal might be infected.Standard security measures include avoiding paying on terminals with visible signs of tampering, avoiding using public WiFi to access financial accounts without a VPN, or failing to validate the transaction details before and after its completion.Moreover, it is essential to regularly monitor financial statements to identify any potentially fraudulent transactions or charges that should be reported to the card issuer immediately."

As of end of 2022, Microsoft tracks >50 unique active ransomware families and >100 threat actors using ransomware in attacks.Last year was marked by the end of the Conti cybercrime operation and the rise of new ransomware-as-a-service (Raas) operations, including Royal, Play, and BlackBasta.Meanwhile, LockBit, Hive, Cuba, BlackCat, and Ragnar ransomware operators have kept breaching and trying to extort a steady stream of victims throughout 2022.However, this significant decline was not driven by fewer attacks but by their victims' refusal to pay the attackers' ransom demands.After hacking into Hive's servers, the FBI distributed more than 1,300 decryption keys to Hive victims and gained access to Hive communication records, malware file hashes, and details on 250 Hive affiliates. "

      "text": " Porsche cut its minting of a new NFT collection short after a dismal turnout and backlash from the crypto community, allowing threat actors to fill the void by creating phishing sites that steal digital assets from cryptocurrency wallets.NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are digital assets stored on a blockchain, representing proof of authenticity and ownership of an item, such as an artwork image, music, and anything that can take the form of digital media.The German automaker launched its first NFT mint last Monday, January 23, 2023, offering a digital replica of the iconic 911 car for 0.911 ETH, valued at about $1,500.However, delays in the rollout of the collection caused frustration in the community, as only about 20% of the promised 7,500 NFTs had been minted after 24 hours and three minting waves.To make matters worse, a flourishing NFT resale market was set up over at OpenSea, where it was cheaper to buy the Porsche collectibles than get the original, which devalued the assets immediately and further infuriated investors and traders.Eventually, on January 24, Porsche announced they would stop the minting process and cut the supply until they figured out how to get the NFT debut right. The actual minting process didn't stop until January 25 at 6 AM UTC-5, giving scammers plenty of chance to leverage the confusing situation.While the Porsche NFTs rose in value in the coming days, so did the scale of fraudulent activity around the mint, with threat actors launching phishing sites to impersonate an ongoing Porsche mint.However, when users connected their crypto wallets to the phishing sites, they would attempt to drain the assets and funds in the wallets.This forced Porsche to warn on January 27 about fake accounts promoting the continuation of the NFT minting process to steal people's details and assets.Today, over a week after Porsche's failed NFT launch, several scammers continue to trick people looking to obtain custom digital 911 NFTs.BleepingComputer had found a notable case of a now-suspended Twitter account with almost 11,000 followers impersonating Porsche's NFT-dedicated account.While this account linked to Porsche's real Discord channel, it also linked to a malicious site (\"porsche-nfts.com\") that's visually a clone of Porsche's genuine NFT portal at \"nft.porsche.com.\"While the actual site has a notice about the minting closure, the fake one pretends that the procedure is still underway, inviting users to link their wallets.Also, the fake Twitter account had a pinned tweet saying that the remaining Porsche NFTs are now available to claim for free while also promising the renewal of the stock for the remaining community.The fake account had disabled user comments under all posts and even re-tweets posts of the real Porsche account, which made it easy to trick people into getting a digital 911 NFT while missing signs of fraud.The scam account was shut down today, with a previous one used by the same scammer appearing also to have been suspended.However, other accounts are likely taking advantage of the Porsche Web3 snafu, so aspiring investors are advised to be extra vigilant."

A worker could be left unpaid, framed or involved in a fraudulent scheme.\"The highest volume of ads was posted during Q1 2020, which coincides with the massive changes brought upon the workforce by the COVID-19 pandemic. A second spike was recorded between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022.As part of the hiring process, cybercriminal recruiters conduct test assignments created to determine an applicant's level of competency in the claimed field.In some cases, the recruiters also look into the provided CV or portfolio, and in one out of four postings, there's an interview session conducted with the job seeker.In characteristic examples spotted by Kaspersky, one job posting promised to pay candidates roughly $300 in BTC for a test assignment. Another job offer laid out a multi-step screening process where the candidate would be asked to encrypt a test DLL in 24 hours, making it fully undetectable by AVs (max of 3 minor AV runtime detects).As cybercrime enterprises adopt business-like operations, we will continue to see the dark web as a recruiting tool for threat actors looking for a stable income.Some software developers may see these opportunities as a lifeline during difficult times of political unrest, poor economies, or a lack of job opportunities in their region.However, it is vital to understand the potential risks of working for a dark web employer, ranging from being scammed to getting framed, arrested, prosecuted, and imprisoned."

There are currently no indications of direct effects on the respective service and, according to the BSI's assessment, these are not to be expected if the usual protective measures are taken,\" the BSI said in a statement.Some financial sector targets had also been affected, the statement added.Killnet is a self-proclaimed Russian \"hacktivist\" group that has actively targeted opponents of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In June, the group claimed responsibility for a DDoS attack against the Lithuanian government after the Baltic country blocked the flow of goods to the Russian region of Kaliningrad.U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant previously reported that Killnet is associated with another Russian hacktivist group, Xaknet, which claims it breached numerous Ukrainian organisations.Xaknet is likely connected to Russian intelligence services, Mandiant said.Western officials say the Russian government is a global leader in hacking and uses cyber-espionage against foreign governments and industries to seek a competitive advantage. However, Moscow has consistently denied that it carries out hacking operations.\"We are not aware of what (Killnet) is.

At the time of writing, all three remain available on Google Play.The antivirus firm says the apps do not allow withdrawals before users have accumulated a significant amount of rewards. Even then, they promise to unlock \"earnings\" after users sit and watch a dozen advertisement videos.Even after watching a round of ads, the apps push even more ads allegedly to \"speed up\" the withdrawal process. In addition to these signs, Dr. Web reports that an earlier version of 'Lucky Step – Walking Tracker' offered the option to convert in-app rewards to gift cards that users could use for purchasing goods in actual online stores.In recent versions of the app, however, this functionality has been removed from the options, so it's not clear what the rewards can be converted to anymore.Some users on Google Play left reviews stating that 'Lucky Step - Waling Tracker' acts as adware, loading full-screen ads upon screen unlock, even overriding active windows.Another example of a similar app that's still available on Google Play is 'Wonder Time,' a rewards app that has amassed 500,000 downloads.The app promises to reward real money for completing various tasks like installing additional applications and games.However, the tokens users receive for each action are minuscule compared to the minimum earnings withdrawal threshold set by the developer.In the same report, Dr. Web warned that phishing apps disguised as investment apps and games were found on Google Play, measuring over 450,000 downloads.The apps connect to a remote server upon launch and receive a configuration instructing them on what to do. Typically, the instructions involve loading phishing pages that request users to enter sensitive details.The malicious game apps observed by Dr. Web are the following:If you have any of the above phishing apps installed on your Android device, you should uninstall them immediately and then run an AV scan to locate and remove any remnants.BleepingComputer has contacted Google to ask about the safety of the applications that are still on the Play Store, and we will update this post as soon as we receive a response."

      "text": " According to DOJ, FBI gained deep access to the Hive ransomware group in the late July 2022. The infiltration prevented them from blackmailing $130 million in emancipate bills from more than 300 organizations. The files of victims are encrypted by ransomware gangs using malicious software, locking them up and rendering them unavailable unless a ransom is paid to obtain a decryption key. It is being estimated that Hive and its affiliates have accumulated over $100 from more than 1,500 victims that included hospitals, school districts, financial companies and critical infrastructure, in more than 80 countries across the globe. The FBI revealed that it has collaborated with the local law enforcement agencies to help victims recover from the attack, including the UK's National Crime Agency, which claims to have given around 50 UK organizations decryptor keys to overcome the breaches. On Thursday, the US announced that it had put an end to the operation by disabling Hive's websites and communication systems with the aid of police forces in Germany and Netherlands. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that \"Last night, the Justice Department dismantled an international ransomware network responsible for extorting and attempting to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world.\" While the Equity Division had not yet been used to capture any individual connected to Hive attacks, a senior official suggested that such releases might happen soon. In regards to the infiltrations, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O Monaco said, \"simply put, using lawful means, we hacked the hackers.\" Moreover, the DOJ says it would pursue those behind the Hive until they were brought to justice. \"A good covert operation can degrade confidence in operational security and inject suspicion among actors,” Mandiant Threat Intelligence head John Hultquist said. \"Until the group is arrested, they will never truly be gone. They will have to reconstitute, which takes time, but I'll bet they reappear in time.\"    your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " The Russian cyber-espionage group known as Gamaredon may have been behind a phishing attack on Latvia's Ministry of Defense last week, the ministry told The Record on Friday.Hackers sent malicious emails to several employees of the ministry, pretending to be Ukrainian government officials. The attempted cyberattack was unsuccessful, the ministry added. The sample of the malicious email was first shared on Twitter by French cybersecurity company Sekoia.io this week. The company obtained it from VirusTotal, a Google-owned service that analyzes suspicious files, where one of the targeted users may have downloaded it to verify its sender, according to Sekoia threat intelligence researcher Felix Aime.A spokesperson for Latvia's Ministry of Defense confirmed that the latest attack was “most likely\" linked to Gamaredon, although the investigation is still ongoing. According to the Latvian computer emergency response team, CERT-LV, the attack was “unusual” because the Russian hackers communicated with researchers in the final stages of the attack when they learned they were being investigated. A CERT-LV spokesperson told The Record that hackers sent a meme depicting a Russian bear holding a paw on Ukraine, while the U.S. and EU try to contain it.Hacker groups tied to the Russian government, including Gamaredon, have targeted Latvian organizations for several years, but their activity rapidly increased since the start of the war in Ukraine. Latvia has supported Ukraine since the beginning of the war, providing weapons, humanitarian aid and shelter for Ukrainian refugees.Other Ukrainian allies, especially former Soviet Union members including Estonia and Lithuania, are also reporting an increase in cyberattacks.Ukraine’s CERT told The Record that Gamaredon is responsible for the largest number of cyberattacks on Ukraine. “Not a week went by that we didn't detect some new mass phishing email campaign with Gamaredon malware,” a CERT-UA spokesperson said.In 2022, Ukraine registered more than 70 incidents related to this group, according to CERT-UA.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

(Credit: Stock Photo, Getty Images)Every day, cyber criminals target government organizations and hospitals, from phishing emails aimed at employees to the more sophisticated cyberattacks targeting networks, critical infrastructure, sensitive mission and patient data, as well as life-saving operational systems in the clinical environment.The threat landscape constantly evolves as adversaries have now shifted their focus on data extortion, while nation-state adversaries take aim at vulnerabilities in the software supply chain with devastating consequences for the public and healthcare sectors.Over the past year, the public and healthcare sectors have focused on how to adapt, persevere and stay a step ahead of cyberattacks in an increasingly ominous threat landscape. But adversaries are relentless and certainly will continue to refine their tradecraft. In 2023, security teams in the public and healthcare sectors will need to stay ahead of identity-based attacks, ransomware-based data extortion attacks, all while navigating macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. 2023 public and healthcare sector cybersecurity trendsAdditionally, the healthcare industry must comply with various regulatory requirements, amplifying the fact that data extortion methods are potentially devastating. With every successful data breach, adversaries have the power to extort millions of dollars from healthcare facilities merely with the threat of leaking or selling sensitive data, such as patient health information (PHI). As a result of this increase in data theft and extortion in healthcare, there will be explosive growth of new criminal marketplaces dedicated to advertising and selling victims’ data to the highest bidders.Cyberattacks will continue to rise in 2023 as cybercriminals and adversaries ramp-up identity-based and ransomware attacks to take advantage of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Public and healthcare sector security teams must adopt a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that includes visibility and proactive protection across identities, IT infrastructures, and cloud workloads.James Yeager, vice president, public sector and healthcare, CrowdStrikeDigital transformation is changing the face of industrial operations and presents opportunities for organizations to revolutionize their businesses. Despite the benefits for OT, digital connectivity also brings great risk to operations.Recent mass cyberattacks that exploited vulnerabilities in software such as MOVEit, Log4j and SolarWinds Orion have served as prime examples of why companies must extend their zero-trust policies to third-party users, devices and infrastructure.

      "title": "2 federal agencies hacked in campaign using remote monitoring software | SC Media",
      "text": "  If exploited by a threat actor, legitimate RMM software can be used as a backdoor for both command-and-control or persistence on a victim’s network.The FCEB compromise was uncovered by Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in October, during a third-party retrospective analysis of EINSTEIN, a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB)-wide intrusion detection system operated and monitored by CISA that found suspected malicious activity on two FCEB networks.The first instance was deployed in mid-June, where threat actors sent a phishing email that included a phone number to an FCEB employee’s government email address. The employee then “called the number, which led them to visit the malicious domain, myhelpcare[.]online.” In September, CISA uncovered bi-directional traffic between an FCEB network and myhelpcare[.]cc. A deeper EINSTEIN analysis and incident response support found “related activity on many other FCEB networks.”The FECB intrusion led to the discovery that the cybercriminals behind the campaign had been sending help desk-themed phishing emails to both the personal and government email addresses of FCEB federal employees.The current, widespread campaign uses phishing emails to trick users into downloading legitimate RMM software, according to the joint CISA, National Security Agency, and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) alert.They aim to “exploit trust relationships in MSP networks and gain access to a large number of the victim MSP's customers,” the alert added. “MSP compromises can introduce significant risk — such as ransomware and cyber espionage — to the MSP’s customers.”The malicious emails contain either a link to “first-stage” malicious domains or prompt recipients to call the actors, who then attempt to trick recipients into visiting the first-stage malicious domain. When the victim visits the nefarious domain, an executable is triggered for download and connects to a “second-stage” malicious domain, then downloads additional RMM software.In the activity discovered by CISA, the actors were using a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts through ScreenConnect, or ConnectWise Control, and AnyDesk.What’s more, the threat actors don’t install downloaded RMM clients on the compromised host. Instead, they install “AnyDesk and ScreenConnect as self-contained, portable executables configured to connect to the actor’s RMM server.” These portable executables do not require users’ context or administrator privileges for installation.Notably, “using portable executables of RMM software provides a way for actors to establish local user access without the need for administrative privilege and full software installation — effectively bypassing common software controls and risk management assumptions.”As such, unapproved software can be executed “even if a risk management control may be in place to audit or block the same software’s installation on the network,” the alert warns. “Actors can leverage a portable executable with local user rights to attack other vulnerable machines within the local intranet or establish long term persistent access as a local user service.”The campaign is financially motivated and could lead to further malicious activity, such as the sale of victims’ account access to other cybercriminal or advanced persistent threat actors.CISA has even detected some phishing attacks’ first-stage malicious domain links periodically redirecting users to other sites for further redirects and downloads of RMM software. Once a user has downloaded the RMM software, the actors use the software to launch a refund scam that initiates a connection to the victim’s system and manipulates the user to log into their bank account while connected to the system.The threat actors’ RMM access can allow them to modify the user’s bank account summary to appear as if they were “mistakenly refunded an excess amount of money. The actors then instructed the recipient to “refund” this excess amount to the scam operator.”Silent Push’s Threat Intelligence Team uncovered the typosquatting activity in October when searching for PayPal typosquatting domains. The researchers found an entire threat “network masquerading as numerous global brand names and infecting machines with a malicious file disguised as a remote monitoring tool - WinDesk.Client.exe.”The large trojan operation mimics Amazon, Microsoft, Geek Squad, McAfee, Norton, and Paypal domains.All organizations are strongly encouraged to review the provided indicators of compromise and recommended mitigations to protect against the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. The alert contains observed first-stage domain naming patterns and other tactics used by these threat actors.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "3 Ways ChatGPT Will Change Infosec in 2023",
      "text": " ChatGPT took the world by storm after OpenAI opened it for testing on Nov. 30, 2022. For an industry calloused by years of largely unsatisfying AI and machine learning \"innovations,\" the reactions have been quite telling. Like many who are excited by its potential, I believe this is finally the moment of clarity for how truly revolutionary AI can be for information security.This is the problem that the array of ISACs across industries have been trying to solve — with mixed results. Going forward, an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) could take an iteration of the ChatGPT model with its natural language interface and feed it log data submitted by ISAC constituents, based on implicit trust within the group. The ISAC could then use ChatGPT to correlate network connections, categories of malicious IP addresses and domains, and similar behaviors. The results could produce a set of IDS rules that the ISAC constituents should implement to protect themselves from threats. The ISAC also would gain insight into the overall risk posture of the industry it represents.The uncertain economy is putting pressure on security organizations to implement hiring freezes to squeeze more productivity out of existing resources. ChatGPT can be extremely beneficial here as a force multiplier that enables one analyst to do the job of multiple people.Today, adversaries generate 100 million new malware samples per year. Because they all require manual coding, it is still a finite, manageable amount for signature detection. With ChatGPT, however, a hacker can say, \"Here's what I'm trying to do, and here's the OS I'm trying to do it on,\" and it can generate hundreds of thousands of iterations of one piece of malware.This will mean that the detection engines' ML models must be recomputed faster. It's far more complicated, because they're working against a much larger data set. Fortunately, ChatGPT will supercharge the reverse-engineering process and give anti-malware efforts a fighting chance.For instance, a significant reverse engineering challenge is working with a generic file name, which doesn't provide necessary context about where it was found. This requires much more manual work to identify the system for which it was built. There are minor changes in binary assembly that have marked changes on the end result — e.g., was it written for a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture? Is the system using Little Endian or Big Endian? The answers determine the direction in which you read the machine language (forward or backward).All these efforts require trial and error if you have no context. ChatGPT can run through these iterations at blazing speed and give reverse engineers the final assembly language and process it from there. They can take it further and have ChatGPT tell them what it thinks the application is doing — in natural language. More importantly, ChatGPT could do all of this at scale, analyzing hundreds of thousands of binary samples and proving insights to an analyst.It also can help fight back against common cat-and-mouse techniques. For example, malware often contains anti-reverse engineering techniques, such as nested loops, to make it much harder for reverse engineers to keep track of what is happening and the end state. ChatGPT can figure that out much faster than humans. It also can analyze the genetic code of the malware and see where there may be code reuse to identify the fingerprint of the author more quickly.Whenever new advances in AI come to fore, there is the inevitable concern about whether it will replace humans and their jobs. I don't believe ChatGPT will make this happen, but it will make us more powerful consumers of information. The force multiplier effect will be profound at all levels. I can see CISOs feeding it a set of information about its risk register for it to return policies and procedures, incident response plans, and more — all tailored to their environments.While ChatGPT is only a research preview, I share the excitement of my industry colleagues about its promise to revolutionize how security practitioners work.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Peterson“Too many bad actors believe they can illegally access proprietary information and personal financial information by hiding behind a keyboard,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown. “FBI Seattle Cyber Task Force and our experienced cyber unit is working diligently to identify, arrest, and prosecute those who seek to victimize people, businesses, and industries in the Western District of Washington and around the world.”According to the indictment, Raoult was a participant in a hacking group that dubbed itself the “ShinyHunters.”  The conspirators allegedly hacked into protected computers of corporate entities for the theft of proprietary and corporate information.  The group advertised sensitive stolen data for sale and sometimes threatened to leak or sell stolen sensitive files if the victim did not pay a ransom.  Since early 2020, ShinyHunters Group has marketed and promoted data stolen from more than 60 companies in Washington State and elsewhere around the world.According to the indictment, the conspirators created websites that appeared to be login pages belonging to legitimate businesses.  The conspirators allegedly sent phishing emails to company employees that were designed to look like they came from legitimate businesses and contained links to those login pages.  When victims provided their account sign-on credentials on those login pages, the conspirators obtained the victims’ credentials.  Using the stolen credentials, the conspirators allegedly accessed protected computers with companies’ data. The ShinyHunters maintained accounts on various dark web sites where they advertised stolen data for sale, including customer databases with personal and financial information.  The conspirators also used social media accounts to direct potential buyers to the dark web marketplaces to purchase stolen data.  Sometimes the conspirators alerted the media to their hacking or posted images on a victim website claiming credit for hacking the company. Some of the victims of the ShinyHunters hacking were located in the Western District of Washington but others were located around the world.  The victims range from tech companies, to an international stock trading company, to an apparel company, and a nutrition and fitness company.  Millions of customer records were included in the stolen data.In addition to the conspiracy counts, the wire fraud counts correspond to particular malicious emails to entities in the State of Washington and other transmissions involving the State of Washington.  The three identity theft counts are for the use of other people’s log-in credentials to access victim company data.In addition to Raoult, the indictment charges 23-year-old Gabriel Kimiaie-Asadi Bildstein aka “Kuroi” and “Gnostic Players,” of Tarbes, France, and 22-year-old Abdel-Hakim El Ahmadi aka “Zac” and “Jordan Keso” of Lyon, France.The conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse charge is punishable by a maximum of ten years in prison.  The conspiracy to commit wire fraud count is punishable by a maximum of 27 years in prison.  Wire fraud is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison.  Aggravated identity theft is punishable by a mandatory minimum two-year prison term to follow any other prison sentence imposed in the case.The charges contained in the indictment are only allegations.  A person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.The case is being investigated by the FBI Seattle Cyber Task Force.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Miriam Hinman.  DOJ’s Office of International Affairs is providing substantial assistance.  The Department of Justice also appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by Moroccan and French authorities.Tacoma – A Sumner, Washington man who has lived under a false identity for more than 25 years was arrested on a federal criminal complaint for Aggravated Identity Theft, falsely...Seattle – A federally convicted Ponzi schemer was arrested today in South Florida following an hours-long stand-off with FBI Miami, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M.

After completing the data destruction job, the malware reboots the systems, ESET researchers say.According to the researchers, Sandworm developed SwiftSlicer in Golang programming language, which has been adopted by multiple threat actors for its versatility, and it can be compiled for all platforms and hardware.The agency’s investigation revealed that SandWorm distributed the malware to computers on the network using a Group Policy Object (GPO) - a set of rules administrators use to configure operating systems, apps, and user settings in an Active Directory environment, the same method also used to execute SwiftSlicer."

We also received court authorization to wrest control of Hive’s dark net sites and render its services unavailable,” said Garland in a press conference.  Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the FBI has been inside Hive's network for months, stealing decryption keys to pass onto victims so they would not have to pay to decrypt their files.“Simply put: using lawful means, we hacked the hackers. We turned the tables on Hive and we busted their business model, saving potential victims approximately $130 million in ransomware payments,” said Monaco.Based on the search warrant executed Jan. 11, the servers were leased using three email addresses that law enforcement had identified as being used by Hive operators.According to testimony from FBI special agent Timothy Callinan, the FBI has had access to Hive’s network since at least July 2022. One of the two U.S.-based servers seized was a redundant backup server hosting Hive’s Tor-based leak sites and victim negotiation portal. The other was a backend server connecting to Hive’s broader network and infrastructure and also contained records of communication between different Hive members, malware hashes as well as information on at least 250 Hive affiliates.The FBI was able to obtain decryption keys for specific intrusions and said it passed 1,000 keys to at least 336 victims, helping save them as much as $130 million in ransom payments.   FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau has since shared decryptor keys with victims in the U.S. as well as \"many victims overseas.\" He used the seizure as an opportunity to urge additional businesses to come forward and provide assistance to the FBI, touting the bureau's efforts to help past victims avoid payments or get their money back and noting that many Hive victims do not report when they are hit with a ransomware attack.\"So today's lesson for businesses large and small, for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this: reach out to your local FBI field office today, introduce yourself so that you know who to call when you become a victim of a cyber attack.\"As part of that advisory, the agencies asked victims to come forward and submit a range of evidence to authorities that may help the FBI investigate, including malware samples, images of infected systems, malicious IP addresses, a copy of their ransom note, ransom amounts, and Bitcoin wallet information.“From June 2021 through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH),” the agencies advised late last year.However, RaaS groups like Hive are massive, decentralized operations with many different affiliates, operators and developers. John Hultquist, Head of Mandiant Threat Intelligence at Google Cloud, said he was skeptical that the operation would cripple Hive's operations but it might dissuade them and similar groups from pursuing higher-value targets.\"The disruption of the Hive service won’t cause a serious drop in overall ransomware activity but it is a blow to a dangerous group that has endangered lives by attacking the healthcare system,\" said Hultquist in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the criminal marketplace at the heart of the ransomware problem ensures a Hive competitor will be standing by to offer a similar service in their absence, but they may think twice before allowing their ransomware to be used to target hospitals.\"Austin Berglas, a former FBI cyber official who helped create and lead the cyber branch at the bureau's New York office, largely concurred with that assessment, saying that takedowns can lead to brief disruptions of ransomware activity but only temporarily, while noting that authorities did not mention any arrests of individuals linked to the group.\"True dismantlement comes only when law enforcement can 'put hands on' or arrest the individuals responsible. However, identifying the actual human beings behind the keyboard is a very difficult task,\" said Berglas, now global head of professional services at BlueVoyant. \"Many of these cyber criminals are adept at anonymizing their online communications, locations, and infrastructure - often operating in global locations where international law enforcement cooperation is non-existent and utilizing bullet-proof hosting providers, which are unresponsive to legal process.\"This is a developing story and SC Media will continue to update as new information becomes available.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": " Lexmark has released a security firmware update to fix a severe vulnerability that could enable remote code execution (RCE) on more than 100 printer models.The security issue is tracked as CVE-2023-23560 and, according to the company, it has a severity rating of 9.0. It is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the Web Services feature of Lexmark devices.The vendor’s advisory says that the bug could be leveraged to gain arbitrary code execution on the device, which could have a wider impact in an organization.In the context of a printing service, an SSRF vulnerability could give attackers to access print jobs, let them obtain the credentials to the network the printer is connected to, and potentially pivot to other devices on the same segment.CVE-2023-23560 impacts a large number of Lexmark printers, so owners of Lexmark devices are recommended to check the advisory and confirm they’re running a safe firmware version released on or after January 18, 2022.In general, all firmware versions numbered 081.233 and below are vulnerable regardless of their letter coding, while fixed versions are numbered 0.81.234 and later.To determine what firmware runs on your device, navigate to “Settings → Reports → Menu Setting Page” and check the version listed under the “Device Information” section.To obtain a copy of the latest firmware version for your printer model, visit Lexmark’s official download portal.For those who cannot apply the security update, Lexmark suggests the workaround of disabling the Web Services feature on TCP port 65002, blocking the ability for attackers to exploit CVE-2023-23560.To do that, head to “Settings → Network/Ports → TCP/IP → TCP/IP Port Access,” uncheck “TCP 65002 (WSD Print Service),” and save the changes.Printer devices are often neglected when it comes to applying good security practices, and they are left exposed to risks for extensive periods.Users should take appropriate measures like applying security updates in a timely fashion, using strong administrator credentials, and disabling unused web-facing services."

During the incident, an attacker gained access to one of eight file servers and accessed both patient and employee health information. The exposed data varied by individual and including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, contact information, and email addresses.The lawsuit took aim at Logan Health’s previous security incident and lawsuit settlement, noting that the health system already “claimed to be taking ‘further steps to revise procedures that will minimize the risk of a similar event happening again.’”The breach victims further alleged that the 2021 incident was directly caused by the provider failing to adhere to representations expressed in the past breach notice. In particular, Logan Health was accused of failing to reasonably train employees and/or implement procedures or protocols that would have prevented the second security incident.“Particularly because Logan Health has demonstrated an inability to prevent a breach or stop it from continuing even after being detected, [individuals] have an undeniable interest in ensuring that their PII/PHI is secure, remains secure, and is not subject to further theft,” according to the lawsuit.As such, the filing asserted that the one-year of identity theft protection offered by the provider was “grossly inadequate.”The purported harm outlined in the lawsuit included references outlining the cost of medical identity theft recovery, which averages up to $19,000 and over 200 hours to resolve the issue. The suit did not, however, detail whether the breach victims had actually experienced these worst-case scenarios as a direct result of the 2021 breach.The proposed settlement appears to take these issues into account and requires Logan Health to share details into the actions it has already taken or its plans to strengthen the cybersecurity training and awareness programs, data policies, security measures, and data restrictions, as well as its monitoring and response capabilities.Individuals affected by the 2021 incident can also file claims to be reimbursed for up to $25,000 in out-of-pocket expenses directly tied to the breach and up to $125 for documented instances of time lost responding to the incident. The settlement also includes alternate cash payments and free credit monitoring for affected individuals.Logan Health also agreed to pay “attorneys’ fees not to exceed one-third” of the settlement and “reimbursement of litigation costs and expenses not to exceed $150,000,” according to the settlement proposal.The proposal is subject to final approval, which is scheduled for March 9.Logan Health joins an increasingly long list of provider organizations to be hit with a patient-led lawsuit after a reported security incident.

Dubbed SwiftSlicer, the Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET discovered the attack levied used Active Directory Group Policy and was written in Go programming language.Once deployed, SwiftSlicer deletes shadow companies and recursively overwrites files located in system drivers and other non-system drives before rebooting the computer. ESET researchers explained on Twitter that the wiper overwrites drives using 4096 bytes-length blocks filled with randomly generated bytes. But long before the Ukraine invasion, the Russian state-sponsored threat group known as Sandworm wreaked havoc across a range of sectors. Sandworm was tied to the notorious NotPetya cyberattacks deployed in 2017 that targeted the health sector and the Ukraine power grid attacks launched in 2015 and 2016.Since early 2022, the group has actively targeted a range of Ukrainian organizations. The last detection was in November, where ESET research connected the novel .NET-based RansomBoggs ransomware variant to the group, given the use of similar tactics and dissemination.The November campaign leveraged a PowerShell script to distribute the ransomware in a nearly identical process to the Industroyer2 malware attacks deployed in April 2022. The POWERGAP PowerShell script levied in the attacks enabled the delivery of CaddyWiper malware via the ArguePatch loader.The Sandworm operation has also been linked to the Russia-backed Iridium, which likely executed a Prestige ransomware attack that targeted transportation and logistics organizations in both Ukraine and Poland.

This incident also impacted Azure Government cloud services that were dependent on Azure public cloud.\"We've confirmed that the impacted services have recovered and remain stable. We're investigating some potential impact to the Exchange Online Service. Further, updates on the Exchange investigation will be available in your admin center under the SI# EX502694.Microsoft now also revealed that the issue was triggered when changing the IP address of a WAN router using a command that had not been thoroughly vetted and that has different behaviors on different network devices.\"As part of a planned change to update the IP address on a WAN router, a command given to the router caused it to send messages to all other routers in the WAN, which resulted in all of them recomputing their adjacency and forwarding tables,\" Microsoft said.\"During this re-computation process, the routers were unable to correctly forward packets traversing them.\"While the network began recovering on its own starting at 08:10 UTC, the automated systems responsible for maintaining the health of the wide area network (WAN) paused due to the impact on the network. These systems included those for identifying and eliminating unhealthy devices as well as traffic engineering systems for optimizing data flow across the network. As a result of the pause, some network paths continued experiencing increased packet loss from 9:35 UTC until the systems were manually restarted, returning the WAN to optimal operating conditions and completing the recovery process at 12:43 UTC.Following this incident, Microsoft says that it's now blocking highly impactful commands from being executed and that it will also require all command execution to follow guidelines for safe configuration changes."

      "text": "  St. Margaret’s Health has temporarily suspended operations at its hospital in Peru, Illinois, as its leadership could not “find nor financially support” a new provider for its emergency room department.The Spring Valley branch was struck by a cyberattack on Feb 22, 2021, prompting the launch of electronic health record downtime procedures and a complete enterprise network shutdown that lasted for several weeks. All web-based operating systems, such as email and the patient portal, were also brought offline.Patient care continued without interruption, due to its previously implemented and practiced downtime procedures. However, the hospital was forced to divert its diagnostic imaging procedures to another hospital branch to ensure accuracy of scans. According to the letter sent to employees, these outages contributed to the hospital’s ongoing financial constraints. The letter cites a number of factors, including the cyberattack that led to the hospital being unable to “bill nor get paid, in a timely manner, for the services provided during the outage. The hospital was also facing staffing shortages that required the use of “temporary agencies to fill positions at a significantly higher pay rate.”“And, like you, we have been faced with rising costs for goods,” the health system CEO and board chair wrote. “This all came at great financial cost. It’s obvious to the Board and Administration that action is needed now.” Further, “the current provider of physicians terminated their contract effective at that time.” The hospital has also struggled to “attract enough staff to continue to operate both hospitals.” As a result of these compounding factors, the hospital will no longer have ER physician coverage at its SMH-Peru branch beginning on Jan. 28 as hospitals aren’t legally allowed to operate without a fully staffed emergency room.The letter notes that hospital leadership will continue its ongoing efforts to convert the Peru branch to a Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) by working with local legislators to “expedite adoption of the REH regulations that were just issued by Centers for Medicare Services (CMS).”Although temporary, the situation is a worst-case scenario stakeholders have long suspected could occur when constrained budgets meet the staggering recovery costs and lost revenue brought on in the wake of a cyberattack.Several estimates based on health systems that provided financial details after an incident detail just how much a cyberattack with related-outages cost provider organizations. For example, the outages at Universal Health Services and Vermont Health lasted about one month, and cost $67 million and $63 million ,respectively.While St. Margaret Health’s hospital closure appears temporary, it should serve as another warning to provider organizations to practice remediation plans and ensure business continuity plans include processes for maintaining critical services in the event of a cyber-related outage.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " Security researchers have analyzed a variant of the PlugX malware that can hide malicious files on removable USB devices and then infect the Windows hosts they connect to.The malware uses what researchers call \"a novel technique\" that allows it to remain undetected for longer periods and could potentially spread to air-gapped systems.Looking for similar samples, Unit 42 also discovered a PlugX variant on Virus Total that locates sensitive documents on the compromised system and copies them to a hidden folder on the USB drive.In the recent attacks that Unit 42 observed, the threat actor is using the 32-bit version of a Windows debugging tool named ‘x64dbg.exe’ along with a poisoned version of ‘x32bridge.dll,’ which loads the PlugX payload (x32bridge.dat).At the time of writing, most antivirus engines on the Virus Total scanning platform don't flag the file as malicious, the detection rate being of just 9 out of 61 products.The researchers explain that the PlugX version they encountered uses a Unicode character to create a new directory in detected USB drives, which makes them invisible on Windows Explorer and the command shell. These directories are visible on Linux but concealed on Windows systems.“To achieve code execution of the malware from the hidden directory, a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file is created on the root folder of the USB device,” Unit 42 says.The malware creates a ‘desktop.ini’ file on the hidden directory to specify the LNK file icon on the root folder, making it appear as a USB drive to trick the victim. Meanwhile, a ‘RECYCLER.BIN’ subdirectory acts as a disguise, hosting copies of the malware on the USB device.The victim clicks on the shortcut file on the root folder of the USB device, which executes x32.exe via cmd.exe, resulting in the infection of the host with the PlugX malware.Simultaneously, a new Explorer window will open to show the user’s files on the USB device, making everything appear normal.After PlugX gets on the device, it continually monitors for new USB devices and attempts to infect them on discovery.During their research, the Unit 42 team has also discovered a document-stealing variant of the PlugX malware that targets USB drives, too, but has the added capability of copying PDF and Microsoft Word documents onto a folder in the hidden directory called da520e5.It is unknown how the threat actors retrieve these “locally exfiltrated” files from the USB drive, but physical access might be one of the ways.While PlugX was typically associated with state-backed threat actors, the malware can be purchased on underground markets and cybercriminals have also used it.With the new development that makes it more difficult to detect and allows it to spread through removable drives, Unit 42 researchers say that PlugX has the potential to jump to air-gapped networks."

This takes the form of malicious links that can lead to credential theft and onward compromise, including data exfiltration.To maintain the ruse, the adversarial crews are said to have created bogus profiles on social media platforms to impersonate field experts and journalists to trick victims into opening the links.The stolen credentials are then used to log in to targets' email accounts and access sensitive information, in addition to setting up mail-forwarding rules to maintain continued visibility into victim correspondence.APT42, which operates as the espionage arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), is said to share overlaps with PHOSPHORUS and is part of a larger group tracked as Charming Kitten.Furthermore, a notable aspect of these campaigns is the use of targets' personal email addresses, likely as a means to circumvent security controls put in place on corporate networks.\"These campaigns by threat actors based in Russia and Iran continue to ruthlessly pursue their targets in an attempt to steal online credentials and compromise potentially sensitive systems,\" Paul Chichester, NCSC director of operations, said.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."
