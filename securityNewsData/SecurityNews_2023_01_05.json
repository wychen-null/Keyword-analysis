      "title": "Graphiron: New Russian Information Stealing Malware Deployed Against Ukraine | Symantec Enterprise Blogs",
      "text": " The Nodaria espionage group (aka UAC-0056) is using a new piece of information stealing malware against targets in Ukraine. The malware (Infostealer.Graphiron) is written in Go and is designed to harvest a wide range of information from the infected computer, including system information, credentials, screenshots, and files.The earliest evidence of Graphiron dates from October 2022. It continued to be used until at least mid-January 2023 and it is reasonable to assume that it remains part of the Nodaria toolkit.Graphiron is a two-stage threat consisting of a downloader (Downloader.Graphiron) and a payload (Infostealer.Graphiron).The downloader contains hardcoded command-and-control (C&C) server addresses. When executed, it will check against a blacklist of malware analysis tools by checking for running processes with the names listed in Table 1.If no blacklisted processes are found, it will connect to a C&C server and download and decrypt the payload before adding it to autorun.The downloader is configured to run just once. If it fails to download and install the payload it won’t make further attempts nor send a heartbeat.Graphiron uses AES encryption with hardcoded keys. It creates temporary files with the \".lock\" and \".trash\" extensions. It uses hardcoded file names designed to masquerade as Microsoft office executables: OfficeTemplate.exe and MicrosoftOfficeDashboard.exeThe payload is capable of carrying out the following tasks:Password theft is carried out using the following PowerShell command:[void][Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault,Windows.Security.Credentials,ContentType=WindowsRuntime];$vault = New-Object Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault;$vault.RetrieveAll() | % { $_.RetrievePassword();$_} | Select UserName, Resource, Password | Format-Table –HideTableHeadersThe following command was used to export the list of PuTTY sessions:\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\reg.exe\" query HKCU\\Software\\SimonTatham\\Putty\\SessionsIn addition to this, as with earlier malware, Graphiron communicates with the C&C server using port 443 and communications are encrypted using the AES cipher.Nodaria has been active since at least March 2021 and appears to be mainly involved in targeting organizations in Ukraine. There is also limited evidence to suggest that the group has been involved in attacks on targets in Kyrgyzstan. Third-party reporting has also linked the group to attacks on Georgia.The group sprang to public attention when it was linked to the WhisperGate wiper attacks that hit multiple Ukrainian government computers and websites in January 2022. When WhisperGate was initially loaded onto a system, the malware would overwrite the portion of the hard drive responsible for launching the operating system when the machine is booted up with a ransom note demanding $10,000 in Bitcoin. However, this was just a decoy as the WhisperGate malware destroys data on an infected machine and it cannot be recovered, even if a ransom is paid.The group’s usual infection vector is spear-phishing emails, which are then used to deliver a range of payloads to targets. Custom tools used by the group to date include:Like Graphiron, many of Nodaria’s earlier tools were written in Go. Graphiron appears to be the latest piece of malware authored by the same developers, likely in response to a need for additional functionality. While GraphSteel and GrimPlant used Go version 1.16, Graphiron uses version 1.18, confirming it is a more recent development.While Nodaria was relatively unknown prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the group’s high-level activity over the past year suggests that it is now one of the key players in Russia’s ongoing cyber campaigns against Ukraine.If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file.SHA-256:0d0a675516f1ff9247f74df31e90f06b0fea160953e5e3bada5d1c8304cfbe63 — Downloader.Graphiron878450da2e44f5c89ce1af91479b9a9491fe45211fee312354dfe69e967622db — Downloader.Graphiron80e6a9079deffd6837363709f230f6ab3b2fe80af5ad30e46f6470a0c73e75a7 — Infostealer.Graphironeee1d29a425231d981efbc25b6d87fdb9ca9c0e4e3eb393472d5967f7649a1e6 — Infostealer.Graphironf0fd55b743a2e8f995820884e6e684f1150e7a6369712afe9edb57ffd09ad4c1 — Infostealer.Graphironf86db0c0880bb81dbfe5ea0b087c2d17fab7b8eefb6841d15916ae9442dd0cce — Infostealer.GraphironNetwork:208.67.104[.]95 — C&C serverThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.We encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform."

      "title": "Phishing Surges Ahead, as ChatGPT & AI Loom",
      "text": " Phishing is having a moment, with a massive spike in campaign volumes in the latter half of 2022. In fact, total phishing emails increased by 61% in the second half, according to an analysis this week. That could also be set to accelerate, as the rise of ChatGPT and other new tools are making their mark on the sector too. Malware volumes overall also increased, 12% quarter for quarter, with Vade detecting 58.9 million emails in the fourth quarter of 2022 that included malware, the researchers found.Email remains the top channel for distributing phishing and malware, giving hackers a convenient, scalable, and efficient vehicle for exploiting users and compromising accounts, Todd Stansfield, content marketing manager, noted in the report.\"Email threat activity continues to increase, creating the need for organizations of all sizes to fortify their cybersecurity,\" he wrote.Breaking down the numbers by the month, phishing volumes remained relatively stable through the first half of the fourth quarter, with 62.3 million phishing emails tracked in October and 47 million in November, according to the report.In terms of who they target and how they do it, phishing threat actors aren't getting especially creative given the current way enterprise users work and collaborate.Facebook remained the top brand in terms of impersonation for the second consecutive quarter, with researchers observing 6,700 unique phishing URLs impersonating the social networking giant in the fourth quarter of 2022, they reported. The company was followed by Microsoft, PayPal, Google, and Netflix in descending order as the brands that threat actors prefer to impersonate.\"With the growing popularity of productivity suites, users are increasingly using email to access and use productivity apps such as file sharing and instant messaging,\" Stansfield wrote, adding that threat actors have taken notice and are crafting phishing campaigns to target the specific behavior of corporate productivity-suite users.\"By purchasing a phishing kit, novice hackers can deploy highly convincing and effective schemes against their targets,\" Stansfield acknowledged.One recent enhancement to these kits is the ability to automatically localize phishing pages based on a victim's native language, a handy tool that allows threat actors to target various regions quickly without being multilingual themselves, the researchers said.The feature works by identifying the language settings of the targeted user's browser and leveraging it to update and display the phishing page accordingly. While improving the contextual accuracy of each phishing attack, the new feature also enables hackers to target users across multiple languages using a single kit, thus increasing the reach of their campaigns, according to Vade.Moreover, the problem with phishing is that it doesn't just end with an attacker giving up credentials, but ultimately, they can use these credentials as a way into corporate networks to steal data, distribute ransomware and other malware, and engage in other nefarious activity.Enterprises need to move beyond traditional email security solutions and adopt ones that can respond to the more sophisticated tactics of attackers, the researchers said. Specifically, collaborative and AI-enhanced solutions that can provide \"predictive defense against known and unknown threats using the latest threat intelligence and a core set of AI technologies,\" are the way forward, Stansfield said.\"On the flip side, we use AI to detect anomalies in email, from the content itself to the behavior of files that might be included in those emails,\" he says. \"There will be a battle between what you might call good and bad AI.\"If phishing emails do slip through an organization's security protections, training employees to identify phishing emails before they click on them can also be a reliable way to prevent credential or malware compromise before it occurs, Scott Caveza, senior research manager at cyber exposure management firm Tenable, tells Dark Reading.\"Phishing attacks continue to be successful as they target our weakest link in security, humans,\" he says. \"Regardless of the author of the email, be it AI or an actual human, organizations need to invest in and develop mature security programs where security awareness training, including specific training on spotting phishing attacks, are priorities for the organization.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " A campaign operated by Russian threat actors uses fake job offers to target Eastern Europeans working in the cryptocurrency industry, aiming to infect them with a modified version of the Stealerium malware named 'Enigma.'The attacks start with an email pretending to be a job offer with fake cryptocurrency interviews to lure their targets. The emails have a RAR archive attachment which contains a TXT (\"interview questions.txt\") and an executable (\"interview conditions.word.exe\").The text file contains interview questions written in Cyrillic, which follow a standard format and are made to appear legitimate.If the victim is tricked into launching the executable, a chain of payloads is executed that eventually downloads the Enigma information-stealing malware from Telegram.The first-stage downloader is a C++ tool that uses techniques like API hashing, string encryption, and irrelevant code to evade detection while downloading and launching the second-stage payload, \"UpdateTask.dll.\"The second-stage payload, also written in C++, uses the \"Bring Your own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD) technique to exploit the CVE-2015-2291 Intel vulnerability. This Intel driver flaw allows commands to be executed with Kernel privileges.The threat actors abuse this vulnerability to disable Microsoft Defender before the malware downloads the third payload.The third-stage downloads the final payload, Enigma Stealer, from a private Telegram channel, which Trend Micro says is a modified version of Stealerium, an open-source information-stealing malware.Enigma targets system information, tokens, and passwords stored in web browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and more. Additionally, it targets data stored in Microsoft Outlook, Telegram, Signal, OpenVPN, and other apps.Enigma can also capture screenshots from the compromised system and extract clipboard content or VPN configurations.Finally, all stolen data is compressed in a ZIP archive (\"Data.zip\") and sent back to the threat actors via Telegram.Some of Enigma's strings, such as web browser paths and Geolocation API services URLs, are encrypted with the AES algorithm in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode, likely to conceal the data and prevent unauthorized access or tampering.Trend Micro has not assigned attribution with strong confidence but discovered several elements that may indicate a Russian threat actor is behind the attacks.The first clue is that one of the logging servers used in this campaign to track the execution flow of active infections hosts an Amadey C2 panel, which is quite popular in Russian cybercrime forums.Second, the server runs \"Deniska,\" a special-purpose Linux system only referenced in Russian-speaking forums.Finally, the server's default time zone is set to Moscow, another indicator that the threat actors are Russian."

As noted, the threat actors leverage SEO poisoning tactics to bring its infected pages to the top of internet browser search results to appear as legitimate sites.“SEO poisoning and Google service abuse, in general, have been documented a lot recently, which indicates this infection vector is becoming common for threat actors,” they added.The team “observed the deployment of Gootloader through heavily obfuscated JavaScript files with a file size of more than 40 Megabytes,” as well as the use of fake search engine ads linked to the infected piece of malware.The infections follow a similar flow: tricking a user into downloading the malware using the above tactics, prompting a ZIP file decompression that leads to the first- and second-stage payloads, and leading to a massive file meant to throw off security tools.Researchers note that most of the domains in the Gootloader PowerShell second stage script had one item in common: “/xmlrpc.php\" was displayed in relation to VirusTotal. The actors behind the variant commonly use compromised WordPress websites to use as C2 servers.After a Gootloader infection, the threat actor used “hands-on keyboard activities” that led to further deployment of attack frameworks, Cobalt Strike and SystemBC, “a proxy malware leveraging SOCKS5 and often used during the exfiltration phase of an attack.”The attacks have also used DLL Hijacking “on top of a VLC MediaPlayer executable.” These frameworks are used in both the infection and lateral movement stages of attacks.A successful infection would give a threat actor the ability to remotely control the victim’s device and gather system information, before launching into a “discovery process” to select the most interesting targets.

      "text": " North Korean state hackers are using a variety of ransomware strains to attack healthcare organizations and other targets globally, with the goal of pulling in money to fund other operations, the U.S. and South Korea said Thursday. Specific targets for those cyber operations include U.S. defense information networks and military contractors, according to joint advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI, the NSA and several South Korean defense and intelligence agencies.North Korean hackers have used both internally developed ransomware like Maui and H0lyGh0st, the agencies said, as well as other extortion malware attained by other means — such as Deadbolt, ech0raix, GonnaCry, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LockBit 2.0, My Little Ransomware, NxRansomware, Ryuk, and YourRansom.The agencies also said North Korean hackers have attempted to portray themselves as members of other ransomware groups like the now-shuttered REvil.They have generated multiple web domains, personas and accounts to obscure their actions, according to the agencies, which noted that the hackers are able to “procure infrastructure, IP addresses, and domains with cryptocurrency generated through illicit cybercrime, such as ransomware and cryptocurrency theft.”They also use VPNs to make it appear attacks are coming from more innocuous locations outside of North Korea. The hackers use a range of exploits for common vulnerabilities like Log4Shell and others. The agencies named three specific vulnerabilities – CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-20038 and CVE-2022-24990 – as ones typically used by North Korean actors. In addition to ransomware, the hackers use other customized malware to exfiltrate data, perform reconnaissance operations and steal files. “DPRK cyber actors have been observed setting ransoms in bitcoin. Actors are known to communicate with victims via Proton Mail email accounts,” the advisory said. “For private companies in the healthcare sector, actors may threaten to expose a company’s proprietary data to competitors if ransoms are not paid.”The advisory highlights a startling trend across the world as nation-states have begun deploying ransomware for a variety of reasons and purposes. Allan Liska, a ransomware expert at cybersecurity company Recorded Future, said more than 50 national governments or national government agencies have been hit by ransomware in 2022. The Record is an editorially independent unit of Recorded Future.“We’ve seen what appear to be government-backed ransomware attacks from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Now, North Korea has always used ransomware attacks, dating back to 2017, but they seem to have really stepped up their attacks this year, making them even more dangerous as an adversary,” he said. Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

The execution of malicious files mimics the process of scanning computers for viruses, making it potentially hard for victims to detect. Hackers also placed the malicious file on a fake website rather than in an email attachment to avoid detection, the report said.  CERT-UA said the payloads allowed hackers to take screenshots of the victim's computer, scan the desktop folder for files with the specified extensions, and exfiltrate user data.

However, the weak chips inside these devices call for an algorithm that can deliver robust encryption at very little computational power.\"These algorithms should cover most devices that have these sorts of resource constraints.\"ASCON was selected as the best of the 57 proposals submitted to NIST, several rounds of security analysis by leading cryptographers, implementation and benchmarking results, and feedback received during workshops. The whole program lasted for four years, having started in 2019.ASCON was eventually picked as the winner for being flexible, encompassing seven families, energy efficient, speedy on weak hardware, and having low overhead for short messages.NIST also considered that the algorithm had withstood the test of time, having been developed in 2014 by a team of cryptographers from Graz University of Technology, Infineon Technologies, Lamarr Security Research, and Radboud University, and winning the CAESAR cryptographic competition's \"lightweight encryption\" category in 2019.Two of ASCON's native features highlighted in NIST's announcement are AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) and hashing.AEAD is an encryption mode that provides confidentiality and authenticity for transmitted or stored data, combining symmetric encryption and MAC (message authentication code) to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.Hashing is a data integrity verification mechanism that creates a string of characters (hash) from unique inputs, allowing two data exchange points to validate that the encrypted message has not been tampered with.NIST still recommends the AES technique for AEAD and SHA-256 for hashing; however, these are unsuitable for smaller, weaker devices.Despite ASCON's lightweight nature, NIST says the scheme is powerful enough to offer some resistance to attacks from powerful quantum computers at its standard 128-bit nonce. However, this is not the goal or purpose of this standard, and lightweight cryptography algorithms should only be used for protecting ephemeral secrets."

      "text": "  Meta is again being called out for its dubious privacy practices, this time over allegations that “significant amounts of sensitive user data” was available for access to “hundreds of thousands of developers” from what Facebook classified as “high-risk jurisdictions,” like China and Russia.An audit of Meta’s privacy practices revealed “nearly 90,000 separate developers” in China and over 42,000 developers in Russia, and thousands of developers in other high-risk jurisdictions, including Iran and North Korea, had access to user information. The letter was sent after the company’s own investigation revealed the apparent data sharing. The internal audit was brought on after the Cambridge Analytica fallout in 2018, where a New York Times report found Facebook handed privileged API access to Huawei, OPPO, TCL, and other China-backed device makers for at least eight years.The Times report confirmed the “device manufacturers were permitted to access a wealth of information on Facebook’s users, including profile data, user IDs, photos, as well as contact information and even private messages.” The news prompted a host of lawsuits.“We were startled to learn recently, as a result of this ongoing litigation and discovery, that Facebook had concluded that a much wider range of foreign-based developers, in addition to the PRC-based device-makers, also had access to this data,” the senators wrote.In fact, Facebook’s own internal materials warned that the high-risk jurisdictions “may be governed by potentially risky data storage and disclosure rules or be more likely to house malicious actors,” including “states known to collect data for intelligence targeting and cyber espionage,” the letter continues.Warner and Rubio have “grave concerns about the extent to which this access could have enabled foreign intelligence service activity, ranging from foreign malign influence to targeting and counterintelligence activity.”Based on the unsealed documents that showed Facebook performed separate reviews on the risky developers, Zuckerberg is asked to explain the review process and conclusions, the precise percentage of the developers located in China and Russia, and “what communications, if any, has Facebook had with these developers since its initial identification.”The senators asked for logs into the frequency of the data sharing, as well as the criteria used to evaluate risk associated with operating in those countries, the exact information they had access to, and for how long. Zuckerberg is also asked to estimate just how many users were impacted this time around.Meta has consistently been in the hot seat over its data practices even before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, particularly over its handling of health data.In October, Warner issued another letter to Zuckerberg demanding: “Where required by law, does Meta always comply with any and all notification requirements when the Meta Pixel handles or transmits protected information, in the manner and time required by such laws?”The company is currently defending itself against well over 1,000 lawsuits, more than a dozen of which are tied to the Pixel tracking tool alone. But with $480.21 billion in market capital, it’s unclear just what impact, if any, these measures will incur.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.TechCrunch reports that more than a million Maine residents were confirmed by state government officials to have had their personal data compromised as part of the widespread MOVEit file transfer system hack conducted by the Cl0p ransomware operation.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.TechCrunch reports that two-factor authentication has been required by major U.S. genetic testing and genealogy firms 23andMe, Ancestry, and MyHeritage in the aftermath of the significant 23andMe breach, which resulted in the theft of data from more than a million of its Jewish Ashkenazi and Chinese users.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Security researchers have discovered four malicious Dota 2 game modes that were used by a threat actor to backdoor the players' systems.\"These game modes were named Overdog no annoying heroes (id 2776998052), Custom Hero Brawl (id 2780728794), and Overthrow RTZ Edition X10 XP (id 2780559339),\" Avast malware researcher Jan Vojtěšek said.The attacker also included a new file named evil.lua that was used to test server-side Lua execution capabilities. This malicious snippet could be used for logging, executing arbitrary system commands, creating coroutines, and making HTTP GET requests.The backdoor enabled the threat actor to remotely execute commands on the infected devices, potentially allowing the installation of further malware on the device.​\"This backdoor permits the execution of any JavaScript acquired through HTTP, providing the attacker the power to both conceal and modify the exploit code at their discretion without undergoing the game mode verification process, which can be dangerous, and updating the entire custom game mode,\" Vojtěšek said.On players' compromised systems, the backdoor was also used to download a Chrome exploit known to be abused in the wild.\"Since V8 was not sandboxed in Dota, the exploit on its own allowed for remote code execution against other Dota players,\" Vojtěšek added.The JavaScript exploit for CVE-2021-38003 was injected in a legitimate file that added scoreboard functionality to the game likely to make it harder to detect.Valve also took down the malicious game modes and alerted all players impacted by the attack.\"One way or another, we can say that this attack was not very large in scale. According to Valve, under 200 players were affected,\" Vojtěšek added.The cheat dev removed the features in a new version on January 21 and apologized for the chaos caused by the cheat's users. "

      "title": "Toyota Global Supply Chain Portal Flaw Put Hacker in the Driver's Seat",
      "text": " [This article was updated on 2/13/2023 with an update from the researcher's report stating that the Toyota portal was created and is maintained by the automaker.]An ethical hacker found a backdoor in a Web app used by Toyota employees and suppliers for coordinating tasks related to the automaker's global supply chain, gaining control of the global system merely by knowing the email address of one of its users.Once acting as an administrator, Zveare said he had \"full access\" to internal Toyota projects, documents, and user accounts, including some of those that belonged to Toyota external partners and suppliers such as Michelin, Continental, Stanley Black & Decker, and Harman.All in all, the researcher gained read/write access to Toyota's global user directory of more than 14,000 users. Zveare also could access corporate user account details, confidential documents, projects, supplier rankings/comments, and other sensitive data related to those users, he said.Indeed, had a threat actor discovered the issue before him, \"the consequences could have been severe,\" Zveare observed.The issue could have allowed attackers to create their own user account with an elevated role to retain access should the issue ever be discovered and fixed, or download and leak all the data to which they had access, he said.They also could have deleted or modified data in a way to be disruptive to global Toyota operations, or crafted a highly targeted phishing campaign to attempt to capture \"real corporate login details, which could have exposed other Toyota systems to attacks,\" Zveare wrote.The researcher reported the issue to Toyota on Nov. 3 and the company reported back 20 days later that it had been fixed — a speedy response with which Zveare was \"impressed,\" he said.\"Out of all the security issues I have reported so far to various vendors, Toyota’s response was the fastest and most effective,\" he said.Fortunately for Toyota, the latest breach was an ethical one and, thanks to Zveare's responsible disclosure, the company could fix it before there was any impact on the company or its partners' business, notes one security professional.However, the GSPIMS API appeared to be secure, which inspired Zveare to further dig into the application code to see what else might be cooking. What he eventually found was that JSON Web Tokens — or session tokens representing the users' valid authenticated sessions on the website — were being generated based on a user's email without requiring a password.Zveare Googled for Toyota supply chain users and made an educated guess to formulate the email of someone who he thought would be a user of the GSPIMS portal. \"Then I fired off the createJWT HTTP request, and it returned a valid JWT!\" he wrote.His discovery gave him the ability to generate a valid JWT for any Toyota employee or supplier registered in GSPIMS, \"completely bypassing the various corporate login flows, which probably also enforce two-factor authentication options,\" Zveare wrote.Though the user whose email he accessed the system with did not have system administrator privileges, he eventually searched within the GSPIMS to find the email of someone who did, and using that he gained full control of the system as an administrator.Enterprises have work to do to in order to block the issue Zveare found, security experts say. For starters, security administrators must take a more holistic approach to security and realize the wider impact their overall security posture — or lack thereof — can have on all of the partners and customers with whom they do business.\"What are perceived as 'internal systems' to organizations, no longer are,\" Dror Liwer, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Coro said in an email statement to Dark Reading. \"With partners, suppliers, and employees collaborating via the Internet — all systems should be considered external, and as such, protected against malicious intrusion.\"Developing this big-picture perspective and security strategy is not so simple, as most enterprises already have their hands full managing their own company's risk, notes Lorri Janssen-Anessi, director of external cyber assessments for BlueVoyant.However, considering how easy it was for Zveare to gain access to a system that serves Toyota's global supply chain, companies need to get their heads around this risk to maintain security across any third party that touches their network, she says.\"What today's organizations should take from the reported vulnerability in Toyota's supplier management network is a firm reminder to look at their own vendor and supplier cybersecurity,\" Janssen-Anessi says.Among the key measures to consider include shoring up access control and user account privileges, ensuring that they only provide employees and third-parties with access to the data needed for their particular role, she notes. \"This helps to control what data can be accessed in the event of a breach,\" Janssen-Anessi says.Indeed, a more data-centric approach overall to security could help enterprises avoid or mitigate a scenario that Zveare demonstrated, Comforte AG's Horst observes. He advises that organizations find ways to protect data as soon as it enters their corporate data ecosystem, thus protecting \"the data itself rather than perimeters and borders around the data.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Google has announced the release of the first developer preview for Android 14, the next major version of the world's most popular mobile operating system, which comes with security and privacy enhancements, among other things.Starting with Android 14, apps will have to declare precisely how they plan to use certain phone features, data exchange between them will be limited, and additional files downloaded by apps will be read-only.A highlighted security feature in Android 14 is to block the installation of malicious apps that target older API levels (Android versions), which allows easier abuse of sensitive permissions.Starting with the \"Runtime receivers,\" which enable apps to receive intents broadcast by the system or other applications, all apps targeting Android 14 must declare if they need to receive information from other apps or if they should be limited to system \"broadcasts.\"This new security measure continues the \"Context.registerReceiver()\" feature introduced in previous Android releases. It aims to prevent malicious apps on the device from intercepting or misusing broadcasts meant to reach other apps.To further tighten up the information exchange between apps and prevent malware from gripping sensitive user data, Android 14 will also restrict the sending of \"intents\" that don't have a specified recipient.With this new security enhancement, malware can no longer intercept intents sent from other apps and read their contents.The third security feature that will land on Android 14 is \"safer dynamic code loading,\" which limits all files downloaded by an application to read-only mode.This would help prevent some code-injection scenarios involving manipulated executables that are meant to be run by privileged apps.Finally, Android 14 will block the installation of harmful apps that target SDK versions lower than 23 (Android 6.0) to achieve easier permissions abuse.\"Malware often targets older API levels to bypass security and privacy protections that have been introduced in newer Android versions,\" explains Google.\"To protect against this, starting with Android 14, apps with a targetSdkVersion lower than 23 cannot be installed.\"In Android 6.0 (2015), Google introduced a runtime permission model that required apps to request the user to grant permission access requests for sensitive operations like the device's camera, microphone, GPS sensors, phone calls, and SMS access upon the app's launch.Malware targeting previous SDK versions can specify it in the manifest XML file and request access to sensitive permissions upon installation, which is easier for users to overlook and approve.The new permissions protection system will also make it impossible for users to install apps that haven't been updated for some time. However, Google says older apps already installed on devices that upgrade to Android 14 will continue to work.Android 14 is still far from its final form, and we may see more security features land on the second developer preview in March 2023."

However, when the list got quickly populated with more addresses, it became clear that the app's server was leaking sensitive information.Trustwave reported the issue to the publisher of Money Lover, Finsify, who released a fixing update on January 27, 2023.The report did not clarify when the flaw was discovered or how long Money Lover users remained exposed.It is essential to clarify that the information disclosure bug only impacted users who used the shared wallet feature.The main repercussion of this flaw is that an attacker accessing email addresses and transaction metadata could perform targeted phishing attacks against the exposed users to gain access to further sensitive information.Money Lover users are recommended to update their app to the latest available version using their operating system's app store."

      "title": "CISA says Killnet DDoS attacks on U.S. hospitals had little effect",
      "text": " The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it helped dozens of hospitals respond to a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) incidents last week that were launched by a pro-Kremlin hacking group.A spokesperson for CISA told The Record that several of the incidents temporarily reduced the availability of the hospitals’ public-facing websites, but there were no reports of unauthorized access to hospital networks, disruption to health care delivery or impacts on patient safety.On their popular Telegram channel, the hackers boasted of launching DDoS attacks on hospitals in more than 25 states. Less than half of the attacks — which involved routing a deluge of page requests at hospital websites — were successful in knocking websites offline, CISA said. The agency said DDoS incidents have become a priority issue. The spokesperson added that for much of the past year, CISA has been helping organizations mitigate DDoS attacks, particularly those launched by Killnet. The agency also worked with several tech companies to provide free resources to under-funded organizations that can help them reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. CISA plans to continue working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to communicate with hospitals about government assistance and third-party services.Cybersecurity firm Cloudflare said hospitals have reached out in recent days looking for help in addressing Killnet’s DDoS campaign. Cloudflare experts said the attacks are not originating from a single botnet — a group of Internet-connected devices taken over by hackers and used to amplify DDoS attacks. Omer Yoachimik, product manager at Cloudflare, told The Record that attacks have come in several waves over the last week and so far have been relatively small, in the range of the range of 10,000 to 100,000 HTTP requests per second (rps). The largest attack on a hospital reached 1.6 million rps, with the peak lasting less than 10 seconds and the entire attack taking about six minutes. Cloudflare did not name the hospital.“That’s a large attack that would degrade services and affect application usability,” he said, adding that most sites would not be able to withstand that without a DDoS protection service.Yoachimik explained that their research into the DDoS campaign indicates that the attacks are being crowdsourced – meaning Killnet operators are reaching out to other groups and individuals that are either using multiple botnets or different attack methods. “It is likely that pro-Russian ransomware groups or operators, such as those from the defunct Conti group, will heed Killnet’s call and provide support. This likely will result in entities Killnet targeted also being hit with ransomware or DDoS attacks as a means of extortion, a tactic several ransomware groups have used,” HHS warned. Akamai’s Patrick Sullivan said attacks on Eastern Europe have skyrocketed from 1% to as high as 30% of all observed attacks on its DDoS platform in 2022.“There has been a surge in politically motivated DDoS attacks in the past year due to heightened geopolitical tensions,” he said. “Threat actors have targeted a variety of sectors, including government institutions and private companies, across Western Europe, in addition to US healthcare organizations most recently.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " The first Linux variant of the Clop ransomware was rife with issues that allowed researchers to create a decryptor tool for victims.Terefos explained that the new Linux variant was mostly used to target educational institutions – including a university in Colombia – but had issues that defenders could exploit to help victims. “We discovered a flaw in the Linux version of Clop ransomware which enabled us to create a decryptor tool. We have not seen any new versions of the ransomware in the wild. However, we predict that the ransomware authors will likely attempt to fix the flaw in future versions, so organizations should take steps to protect themselves against the ransomware,” Terefos said. “We found that the Linux version of the Cl0p ransomware is in an early stage of development, suggesting that the threat actors are still manually operating and tweaking the ransomware to target specific victims. We also noticed that the ransomware had hardcoded victim-specific details, such as file paths for encryption, indicating that the threat actors had knowledge of the victim environment before launching the attack.”The researchers noted that the developers likely did not invest much time or resources into improving the obfuscation or evasiveness of the Linux version because many security systems could not detect it. The Windows version allowed the ransomware group to list out what folders and files should not be encrypted, but that functionality was not seen with the Linux version. The Linux version was used to target specific folders and all file types. “Rather than simply port the Windows version of Cl0p directly, the authors have chosen to build bespoke Linux payloads. We understand this to be the primary reason for the lack of feature parity between the new Linux version and the far more established Windows variant,” Terefos explained.“SentinelLabs expects future versions of the Linux variant to start eliminating those differences and for each updated functionality to be applied in both variants simultaneously.”The Linux version also leaves the ransom note in a .txt format while the Windows version leaves the ransom note in .rtf.In spite of the June 2021 arrests, Clop has not stopped operating and the development of a Linux version should prompt defenders to be ready for anything, Terefos said. “Ransomware groups are constantly seeking new targets and methods to maximize their profits. Being widely used in enterprise environments, Linux and cloud devices offer a rich pool of potential victims,” Terefos told The Record. “In recent years, many organizations have shifted towards cloud computing and virtualized environments, making Linux and cloud systems increasingly attractive targets for ransomware attacks. Therefore, ransomware groups targeting Linux and cloud systems is a natural progression in their quest for higher profits and easier targets.”Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  Tallahassee Memorial Health is continuing to divert some emergency care patients five days after a reported IT security issue, despite making progress in its recovery efforts.TMH has been “proactively working to solve” the incident with support from law enforcement, which has brought some of its care services back online. Notably, the health system canceled surgeries between Thursday and Monday, but is now “performing limited surgeries and procedures.”The networks for its labor and delivery facility, as well as its connected physician practices, are operational. However, clinicians are still leveraging paper processes for registration, admission, and during care, which is causing expected delays in care. “Our teams are working around the clock in collaboration with outside consultants to investigate the cause of the event and safely restore all computer systems as quickly as possible,” according to the latest notice. But as with most healthcare security incidents, recovery is often slow-going. For some of the largest health systems, EHR downtime can last up to four weeks.But all hospital services remained open, outside of its pharmacy, outpatient imaging, and pulmonary function testing services. A website notice shows imaging and walk-in lab services remain closed. The hospital has not provided an update outside of the initial report.A successful phishing attack against a Highmark employee in December potentially compromised the data of 300,000 patients.The notice shows an employee was sent an email with a malicious link, which compromised their email account for two days between Dec. 13 and Dec. 15. Upon discovery, Highmark immediately shut down the account, reset passwords, and implemented network blocking.However, the compromise enabled the threat actor to access emails within the account, some of which contained patient data.The data varied by patient and could include names and Social Security numbers, as well as enrollment information like group names, identification numbers, claims data, treatment information, dates of service, procedures, and prescription information. For some patients, financial information, contact details, and email addresses were also compromised.Highmark is continuing to bolster its email security controls, as it provides employees with further cyber and phishing training to help prevent future attempts.Sharp Healthcare is notifying 62,777 patients of a recent website hack that potentially compromised their protected health information. Sharp Health is a nonprofit healthcare group based in San Diego.On Dec. 12, a hack was detected on a server that supports the Sharp Health website. The IT team took the affected servers offline and launched incident response protocols. The forensics later determined the activity was tied to a threat actor accessing a website server for several hours, which led to the access of a single file containing patient data. The data varied by patient and could include patient ID numbers, invoice numbers, payment amounts, and provider names. No financial data or further identifiers were compromised during the incident. Sharp Health stressed that only patients “who paid a bill or invoice using the online bill payment service between Aug. 12, 2021, and Jan. 12, 2023” were affected.”The health group has since enhanced its website security tools and is continuing to monitor its “systems to proactively identify additional safeguards.”A network hack against Cardiovascular Associates led to the theft of data for 441,640 patients tied to its Alabama care sites.First discovered on Dec. 5, a threat actor gained access to “certain systems” within the CA network. After securing the impacted systems, an investigation was launched with support from an outside forensic firm. The forensic evidence revealed the access enabled the actor to copy some personal and health data from the network for a week between Nov. 28 and Dec. 5. The stolen information could include demographic details, SSNs, health insurance information, treatment information, medical record numbers, dates of service, provider names, diagnoses, health assessment information, tests and imaging, and billing and claims data. Some passports, driver’s licenses, credit and debit card information, and other financial account details were also affected.In response to this incident, Cardiovascular Associates has added further security and monitoring enhancements to minimize the risk of a recurrent incident.Regal Medical Group, Lakeside Medical Organization, ADOC Medical Group, and Greater Covina Medical in New York was hit with a ransomware attack on Dec. 8, which led to the exfiltration of data tied to over 3.3 million patients. It's the biggest healthcare data breach reported so far this year and impacts more patients than the third-largest incident reported in 2022.The health group is known collectively as Regal, and its notice shows the cyberattack began on Dec. 1 but went undetected for one week.After experiencing “difficulty in accessing some servers,” Regal performed an extensive review that found malware on some of its servers. The subsequent investigation later found the incident was caused by a threat actor accessing and exfiltrating data from its systems.A third-party team helped the medical group with its response to the incident, including restoring access to the systems and analyzing the impacted data. The stolen data could include names, SSNs for some patients, dates of birth, contact details, diagnoses, treatments, lab test results, prescriptions, radiology reports, and health plan numbers.Regal is providing all impacted patients with a year of free credit monitoring and has since bolstered its security and protocols.A network hack deployed against Howard Memorial Hospital in December led to the exfiltration of data tied to 53,668 patients. HMH detected the hack on Dec. 4 after the actor publicly claimed to have stolen patient data from its network.An investigation confirmed the allegations and determined the threat actor first gained access on Nov. 14. Upon discovery, HMH secured the network and performed a comprehensive review to identify the potentially stolen information.But “ultimately, HMH made the decision to notify all current or former patients and employees, in an abundance of caution, due to a potential impact to their information,” according to the notice. The data possibly accessed or stolen by the attacker could include SSNs, contact details, dates of birth, health insurance information, medical record numbers, medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and physician names.Update: This story was updated on Feb 10 to include the number of patients affected by the Regal incident, newly reported to the Department of Health and Human Services.Update 2: This story was updated on Feb. 21 to include the number of patients impacted by the Cardiovascular Associates incident as reported to HHS.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Okta had 4,961 current and former employees' data, including names, health insurance plan numbers, and Social Security numbers, compromised following a breach at its third-party vendor Rightway Healthcare, reports The Register.Threat actors using private keys and passphrases from LastPass databases stolen in cyberattacks last August and December were reported by ZachXBT and MetaMask developer Taylor Monahan to have been able to exfiltrate $4.4 million worth of cryptocurrency on Oct. 25, BleepingComputer reports.The three companies claim no sensitive customer data was lost despite being targeted after the breach of the identity and access management firm.On-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " A new QBot malware campaign dubbed \"QakNote\" has been observed in the wild since last week, using malicious Microsoft OneNote' .one' attachments to infect systems with the banking trojan.Qbot (aka QakBot) is a former banking trojan that evolved into malware that specializes in gaining initial access to devices, enabling threat actors to load additional malware on the compromised machines and perform data-stealing, ransomware, or other activities across an entire network.Threat actors can embed almost any file type when creating malicious OneNote documents, including VBS attachments or LNK files. These are then executed when a user double-clicks on the embedded attachment in a OneNote Notebook.However, it is necessary to introduce social engineering to convince users to click on a particular spot to launch the embedded attachment, usually done with a 'Double Click to View File' button or some other call to action, as shown below.Once launched, the embedded attachments can execute commands on the local machine to download and install malware.This switch in QBot's distribution was first publicly reported by Cynet's researcher Max Malyutin on Twitter on January 31, 2023.A script in the HTA file will use the legitimate curl.exe application to download a DLL file (the Qbot malware) to the C:\\ProgramData folder and is then executed using Rundll32.exe.The QBot payload injects itself into the Windows Assistive Technology manager (“AtBroker.exe”) to conceal its presence and evade detection from AV tools running on the device.Sophos reports that QBot’s operators employ two distribution methods for these HTA files: one that sends emails with an embedded link to the weaponized .one file and one where the “thread injections” method is used.The latter is a particularly tricky technique where the QBot operators hijack existing email threads and send a “reply-to-all” message to its participants with a malicious OneNote Notebook file as the attachment.To make these attacks even more deceptive for the victims, the threat actors use a fake button in the Notebook file that supposedly downloads the document from the cloud, but if clicked, it instead runs the embedded HTA attachment.While this action will generate a warning dialog for the victim warning about the risks of running attachments, there's always a chance that it will be ignored.As a defense against this new attack vector, Sophos suggests that email administrators consider blocking all .one file extensions, as they are not commonly sent as attachments. "

However, it requires being part of the preview, which is slowly adding new users.Microsoft says that users can \"get ahead in the line\" by downloading the 'Microsoft Defaults' program, which sets Edge and Bing as your default browser and search engine, and by installing the Microsoft Bing app.In BleepingComputer's tests, this did not allow us to immediately get access to Bing's AI chat feature but allegedly moved us up on the waiting list.For those that can't yet access the preview, Microsoft has shared the following chat queries that you can test today to see how the new AI-powered search engine works:For example, if you ask Bing to suggest a 3-course menu, it will generate a menu using recipes from the search index. When generating the AI-chat answer, each sourced item will link to the original source.Microsoft also uses the AI model with the core Bing search-ranking engine, which, according to the company, has led to \"the largest jump in relevance in two decades,\" making searches more relevant and accurate."

Running this file installed the Remcos program on the victim's computer. CERT-UA did not disclose which Ukrainian government services were targeted by phishing emails or whether hackers managed to successfully install the spyware. The agency pinned the effort on a group labeled UAC-0050 that has been active in Ukraine since 2020. The hackers carried out previous attacks using remote desktop software Remote Utilities, CERT-UA said.A possible goal of the group is espionage, according to CERT-UA, as its members mostly targeted Ukraine’s government services.Breaking Security openly advertises Remcos on its website, describing it as “a lightweight, fast, and highly customizable remote administration tool with a wide array of functionalities.” Users can download the free version of the software or buy the premium version for €58 ($62). This Excel file displayed a yellow security bar warning the victim about dangerous macro code. The file message lured the victim into clicking the button to bypass the warning and execute the malicious macro code, Fortinet explains.With Remcos software, hackers can steal user credentials, gain control over online accounts and deploy additional malware variants on an infected computer, researchers said.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " Many online stores are exposing private backups in public folders, including internal account passwords, which can be leveraged to take over the e-commerce sites and extort owners.The study examined 2,037 stores of various sizes and found that 250 (12.3%) exposed ZIP, SQL, and TAR archives on public web folders that can be freely accessed without requiring authentication.The archives appear to be backups containing database passwords, secret administrator URLs, internal API keys, and customer PII (personally identifiable information).In the same report, Sansec explains that its analysts observe constant activity from attackers who launch automated scans trying to pinpoint these backups and perform breaches.“Exposed secrets have been used to gain control of stores, extort merchants and intercept customer payments.”Threat actors try out various combinations of possible backup names on target sites based on the site name and public DNS data, such as “/db/staging-SITENAME.zip.”Because these probes are inexpensive to run and do not affect the target store’s performance, threat actors can conduct them for entire weeks until they find a backup.Sansec reports seeing multiple source IPs for these attacks, so threat actors are well aware of the existence of exposed backups, and many of them are attempting to take advantage.If the exposed backups contain administrator details, master database passwords, or staff accounts, the attackers can use them to gain access to the site and steal data or perform destructive attacks.Sansec urges website owners to routinely check their sites for accidentally exposed data and backup.If you have exposed a website backup publicly, immediately reset admin accounts and database passwords, and enable 2FA on all staff accounts.Additionally, check the web server logs to see if the backup was downloaded by a third party, and check admin account activity logs to identify signs of external access and malicious behavior.Sansec suggests that website administrators configure the webserver to restrict access to archive files if not needed in daily operations to prevent data leaks. Additionally, those using the Adobe Commerce platform should use the “immutable storage” feature."

      "text": " A new version of the Medusa DDoS (distributed denial of service) botnet, based on Mirai code, has appeared in the wild, featuring a ransomware module and a Telnet brute-forcer.Moreover, Medusa is now promoted as a MaaS (malware-as-a-service) for DDoS or mining via a dedicated portal. It promises service stability, client anonymity, support, an easy-to-use API, and adjustable cost based on specific needs.What's particularly interesting in this new Medusa variant is a ransomware function that enables it to search all directories for valid file types for encryption. The list of target file types includes mainly documents and vector design files.Valid files are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption, and the .medusastealer extension is appended to the encrypted files' nameHowever, the encryption method appears broken, turning the ransomware into a data wiper.After encrypting files on the device, the malware sleeps for 86,400 seconds (24 hours) and deletes all files on the system drives.Only after deleting files does it display a ransom note that asks for the payment of 0.5 BTC ($11,400), which is counter-intuitive for a successful extortion attempt.Cyble believes this is an error in the code as the destruction of system drives makes it impossible for the victims to use their systems and read the ransom note. This bug also indicates that the new Medusa variant, or at least this feature, is still in development.It's worth noting that while the new version of Medusa features a data exfiltration tool, it does not steal user files before encryption. Instead, it focuses on collecting basic system information that helps in identifying victims and estimating resources that can be used for mining and DDoS attacks.Medusa also features a brute forcer that tries out commonly used usernames and passwords against internet-connected devices. Then, if successful, it attempts to download an additional payload that Cyble hasn't been able to retrieve and analyze.Next, Medusa executes the \"zmap\" command to find other devices with Telnet services running on port 23 and then tries to connect to them using the retrieved IP addresses and a combination of usernames and passwords.Finally, upon establishing a Telnet connection, the malware infects the system with the primary Medusa payload (\"infection_medusa_stealer\").The final Medusa payload also has incomplete support for receiving the “FivemBackdoor” and “sshlogin” commands.However, the corresponding code isn’t present in the client Python file yet, which is another sign of its ongoing development."

NetApp indicated it is still investigating whether any host utilities for SAN for Windows may also impacted. In October IBM warned its Tivoli Monitoring solution was impacted by the bug.A successful exploitation of the bug, NetApp warned, “could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service.”HPE explained that Expat is used by its OneView platform to parse various XMLs. The bug, HPE said, only impacts versions of HPE OneView prior to 8.1. In a technical summary, HPE explained vulnerable systems allow an “attacker to triage a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.”NIST wrote, versions of Expat (libexpat) before 2.4.9 have a use-after-free in the doContent function in xmlparse.c.

      "text": "  By exploiting the unpatched devices, the threat actors are able to gain network compromise and escalate privileges. The researchers have observed other possible victims from other verticals, which also led to data exfiltration.WithSecure has identified the ongoing campaign’s victims in healthcare research, a manufacturer of technology used in energy, research, defense, and healthcare verticals, and a chemical engineering department of a leading research university.Dubbed \"No Pineapple,\" the attacks leave an error message in a backdoors appended with the name “in the event data exceeds segmented byte size.” The report shows it appears these attacks are designed to gather intelligence from victim organizations. “The victimology follows the established pattern of high-value targets in medical research and energy, additionally WithSecure believes the threat actor has intentionally targeted the supply chain of these verticals,” according to the report.As reported in the fall of 2022, a critical remote code vulnerability listed as CVE-2022-41352 and rated a 9.8 in severity was reported as actively exploited in the wild beginning in mid-September. The flaw is caused by the devices using an antivirus engine that employs a cpio utility to scan inbound emails. A vulnerability in the utility can enable an attacker to create an archive to access any files within the Zimbra devices.The WithSecure report suggests that this is exactly what happened.Its researchers responded to a cyberattack leveraging these tactics during Q4 2022, which has been attributed with high confidence to the Lazarus Group. The forensic evidence shows signs of characteristics leveraged by the North Korea state-sponsored threat actors in other  campaigns.The attack was deployed against a Zimbra mail server in August, where the attackers exploited a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Zimbra server. After a week of dwell time, the threat actor exfiltrated approximately 100GB of data from the mail server without taking any “destructive action by the point of disruption.”After one month, the threat actor laterally moved to a vulnerable domain joined by a Windows XP device. Over a monthlong period, the attacker continued to move laterally across the network, performing reconnaissance, and deploying multiple custom tools and malware. Dtrack was one variant used, which the researchers believe is an updated version of GREASE.In the observed campaign, the threat actor used readily available, off-the-shelf webshells and custom binaries, in addition to abusing legitimate Windows and Unix tools. A successful exploit can enable an attacker to install tools for proxying, tunneling, and relaying connections.The “actor used many built-in commands to enumerate the network and compromised devices,” the report notes. “Some of these commands were hardcoded into binaries, but others were run manually by the operators. Many commands used were standard Windows command line tools, though two PowerShell cmdlets were also run.”Its C2 behavior suggests that it employs a small number of C2 servers, which are connected through multiple relays and endpoints. The report notes that “some C2 servers appear to themselves be compromised victims.”What’s more, “web shells and Cobalt Strike beacons were observed which served as persistence mechanisms, the report authors wrote. Legitimate accounts were also compromised, and the threat actors created illegitimate accounts. The actor also created auto-run services and scheduled tasks, commonly used to persist on a network.The researchers warned that the actor also attempted to remove artifacts and indicators of their presence, such as deleting files and tools and clearing logs, to evade detection. They also tried “to give dropped files innocent names which would blend into the system.” In one instance, they named files the same as directories within a parent network of exploited Zimbra servers.The report contains a long list of tactics and methods deployed during the observed campaign that can support identification and possible remediation.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": "  OpenEMR is a popular electronic health records system with an estimated 5,000 downloads each month by 100,000 global providers and serving over 200 million patients. Maintained by a community of volunteers and support professionals, OpenEMR is notably used by PeaceCorps, IPPF, and the Siaya District Hospital in Kenya. The Sonar report details the unauthenticated file read, authenticated local file inclusion, and an authenticated reflected XSS. Without the patch, “a rogue MySQL server can read arbitrary files from an OpenEMR instance,” according to the report. Further, the installer fails to delete itself after a successful installation and, as the setup is divided into parts, an unauthenticated user can perform some actions through a user-controlled parameter state.As a result, an unauthenticated attacker would be able to perform a database query on their own server by enabling the MySQL statement LOAD DATA to load the contents of a file into a database table.“If the modifier LOCAL is given, the file is read from the client instead of the server,” Sonar researchers wrote.An attacker-controlled MySQL configuration can lead to the compromise of the arbitrary file read vulnerability. And when combined with the two other flaws, an unauthorized attacker can take over the device and deploy remote code execution.The HC3 alert warns that each of these flaws “represent opportunities for cybercriminals to launch ransomware attacks and data breaches — both of which are persistent threats to the health sector, among other types of attacks.”Although providers can completely reinstall OpenEMR, the alert warns that attackers can specify a configuration during the setup steps via the properties of the Installer class to take over any OpenEMR instance.As noted, OpenEMR maintainers addressed all of these serious vulnerabilities and further hardened the application in its November 2022 update to version 7.0.0 of the platform.The EMR now includes a series of CSRF checks and sessions to patch the arbitrary file read vulnerability, which also further restricts the installation process. Now, even an unauthenticated attacker would need to go through the installation steps in the correct order. And “when a config file already exists in an installed OpenEMR instance, the setup process fails in the first step.”OpenEMR also strengthened the PHP function to encode important characters and blocks the ability of an attacker to escape the context and prevents the XSS vulnerability. The update also sanitized the user-controlled parameter, which now only allows alphanumeric characters to prevent path traversal.OpenEMR intends to bolster this process to reduce the risk of potential exploit, as well.Maintainers of the OpenEMR are notoriously responsive to any potential vulnerabilities. In one notable instance from 2018, when researchers found nearly 30 critical vulnerabilities in the platform that left millions of patient records vulnerable to attack. It was the second round of security flaws found that year.Those bugs included flaws that could enable an attacker to bypass the patient portal authentication and navigate to the registration page, as well as change the URL. A number of SQL injection bugs were also found that could be used to view data from targeted databases. The round of disclosures included other remote code execution vulnerabilities.Much like the latest vulnerability disclosure, OpenEMR was quick to provide an update that eliminated these risks.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Atlassian has confirmed exploitation of an already addressed Confluence Data Center and Server flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-22518, to facilitate ransomware deployment after a Rapid7 report observed related infections with the Cerber ransomware, which is long believed to be defunct, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.SecurityWeek reports that patches have been released by Veeam to remediate four security vulnerabilities impacting its Veeam ONE IT monitoring and analytics solution.It’s clear iLeakage presents itself as a major flaw with no known mitigation and it’s a real problem for iOS devices – here are some ideas on how to respond.

As with all additions to the list, CISA explained that the vulnerabilities are “frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.”SugarCRM released a report on January 13 claiming that “no intrusion has been detected in any instances of Sugar Sell, Enterprise, Professional, Serve, and Ultimate software solutions running in the SugarCloud.” Andrew Barratt, vice president at Coalfire, told The Record that SugarCRM is a hugely popular customer relations management product often used by small and medium enterprises as well as middle market organizations.“The vulnerability announced allows for remote code execution which creates substantial amounts of risk,” he said. “CRM tools typically have large amounts of both personal data and commercially sensitive information. Often these are a treasure trove of deals and opportunities. There is downstream risk though if a CRM is compromised whilst the data might be considered to belong to the user. That data is probably relevant to many of their customers creating an amplification of the issue.”Netenrich’s John Bambenek noted that the two vulnerabilities represented two very different market segments, illustrating the wide array of targets nation-states and cybercriminals now have access to. “SugarCRM is going after the small business market and those who don’t have the resourcing to pay for and fully realize the value of SalesForce,” he said. “Oracle is on the other end of that spectrum with many enterprise users.

This included the use of a hacktivist identity (Holy Souls) in claiming credit for the attack, the leaking of private data, and the use of fake — or \"sockpuppet\" — social media personas to amplify news of the attack on Charlie Hebdo.For instance, following the attack, two social media accounts (one impersonating a senior French tech executive and the other an editor at Charlie Hebdo) began posting screenshots of the leaked information, Microsoft said. The company said its researchers observed other fake social media accounts tweeting news of the attack to media organizations, while others accused Charlie Hebdo of working on behalf of the French government.The FBI has described the group's MO as including first-stage reconnaissance on potential targets via Web searches, and then using the results to scan for vulnerable software that the targets could be using. \"In some instances, the objective may have been to exploit a large number of networks/websites in a particular sector as opposed to a specific organization target,\" the FBI has noted. \"In other situations, Emennet would also attempt to identify hosting/shared hosting services.\"When attempting to break into a target network, Neptunium first verifies if the organization might be using default passwords for specific applications, and it tries to identify admin or login pages. \"It should be assumed Emennet may attempt common plaintext passwords for any login sites they identify,\" the FBI said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Hive takedown illustrates FBI's evolution towards victim-recovery efforts | SC Media",
      "text": "  FBI Director Christopher Wray, center, joined by Attorney General Merrick Garland, right, and Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco, delivers remarks on an international ransomware enforcement action at the U.S. Justice Department on Jan. 26, 2023, in Washington. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The bureau was pilloried by much of the broader cybersecurity community, as well as members of Congress, for seemingly prioritizing its own investigative and law enforcement activities while leaving hundreds of Kaseya customers twisting in the wind, agonizing over whether to pay millions of dollars in ransom or refuse and see their data lost or leaked on the internet.Former Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus who built a reputation as one of the most cyber-savvy House legislators, echoed the frustration of many on the Hill and within the private sector when he chided Wray for the bureau’s response, analogizing it to the police blocking firefighters from putting out a house fire because it might damage forensic evidence that would help them investigate the arsonist. “I would just push back and say that asset response has to be higher on the priority list. So much could have been prevented had those decryption keys been given to businesses that were impacted,” said Langevin.The reaction from former critics like Langevin — as well as the details of the Hive takedown, public comments by FBI leadership and interviews with former government officials — indicate that the bureau may be internalizing some of the hard lessons it took from the fallout of the Kaseya incident when it comes to prioritizing victim recovery.Austin Berglas, a former FBI cyber official, said the Kaseya and Hive operations “are things that are new situations that law enforcement and the FBI have been put into” over the past half decade as cybercrime, state-backed hacks and other forms of digital crime have become higher priorities for law enforcement and policymakers.“I think that when you look at what happened with Kaseya and now Hive — [there were] huge lessons learned,” said Berglas, now global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, in an interview.That learning curve includes a renewed emphasis on victim recovery, both in operational priorities and public messaging.Whereas during the Kaseya episode the FBI opted to keep their possession of REvil’s decryptor key a secret from victims, a search warrant used to seize two U.S.-based Hive servers on Jan. 11 this year disclosed that agents had actually infiltrated the ransomware group’s network six months earlier, spending part of that time stealing over 1,000 decryptors that they then quietly passed along to over 300 victims and businesses.Wray and others practically treated their press conference announcing the takedown as a commercial to advertise the unique benefits that businesses and victims could potentially reap by picking up the phone and calling the FBI in the wake of an incident.“Our actions in this investigation should speak clearly to those victims: it pays to come forward and to work with us…we need your help to stop cyber criminals to prevent future victims and in exchange, we pledge our tireless efforts to help you protect your systems and to prevent or recover losses,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at one point.To be clear, there is still a fair bit we do not know about the precise circumstances behind the Hive operation, such as what pushed the FBI to move on seizing the servers and shutting down Hive’s dark net sites in January, how early the FBI used its access to Hive’s network to pilfer victim keys (Monaco said the activities went on “for months”) or precisely how the bureau balanced those needs with other investigative and disruptive priorities.I think a lot of this is a reaction to things that they didn’t quite get right, or at least the perception that they didn’t get right, in the Kaseya case,” said Bryan Ware, a former assistant director at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and is now CEO of LookingGlass Cyber Solutions. “You can’t just tell businesses not to pay the ransom but then they’re left to their own devices. This [incident] shows…that the bureau has some teeth here and is willing to be a good partner.”The Department of Justice will likely always need to walk a fine line between helping victims and gathering intelligence or moving to dismantle ransomware infrastructure before a group is potentially tipped off that their network is compromised. However, the renewed public focus on recovering lost data and getting organizations back up and running is “absolutely a message of success and something that they will use as a foundation going forward.”“Private companies want to know, [if I] share my intelligence and share my information, what am I going to get back? That’s the question always,” said Berglas, relaying feedback the government frequently hears from cooperating businesses. “Often times we’re giving indicators of compromise and domains and IP addresses and all this stuff, but I never hear anything back from you guys. This is the [FBI’s] message, this is saying if you report these things to us, our aperture can open up, we can start helping you.”One of the reasons the FBI and Department of Justice are increasingly emphasizing their remediation and recovery efforts these days may be because they have lost ground over the past few years to other federal agencies when it comes to being the cybersecurity communication gateway to the private sector.Chiefly, the elevation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency over the past five years has eaten into the FBI’s role as the primary federal entry point for hacked organizations.There remain large and meaningful differences between the writs of FBI’s and CISA over cybersecurity issues. For instance, CISA has little if any authorities over traditional law enforcement investigations or prosecution of cybercrime, focusing mainly on coordinating with private sector entities and providing technical assistance to insecure organizations. It’s also far smaller, less resourced and lacks the authorities or capabilities to do anything like the Hive takedown.Wray often likes to note that the FBI has well-staffed field offices in every state and can often be at the door of a hacked business “within an hour” of getting a call. Ware noted that despite the increased authorities and funding from Congress, CISA still lacks anything close to that kind of reach and presence, with approximately 150 cybersecurity advisors spread out across all 50 states.“I think there is a desire to have that single front door [for the private sector] but there’s some practical challenges. One of those is that if it’s a criminal matter, CISA is not a law enforcement agency, it doesn’t have the criminal authorities, it can’t do the same kind of investigations, it can’t recover lost funds, it can’t bring the bad guys to justice,” said Ware.The flip side is that while the FBI and Wray have far more resources to bring to bear, the bureau also have a much larger mission portfolio and their top cyber officials tend to operate lower in departmental hierarchy. By contrast, CISA and its director, Jen Easterly, essentially function as the top cybersecurity authorities within the Department of Homeland Security (although technically other officials, like undersecretary Rob Silvers, sit above Easterly and wield influence over policy), allowing for a sharper focus on cyber issues.That hasn’t stopped FBI officials from continuing to insist, as Wray did at the end of the Hive presser, that the agency still has a unique federal role and capabilities that should incentivize the private sector to reach out when they are hit with a cyberattack.“Today’s lesson for businesses large and small, for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this: reach out to your local FBI field office today. Introduce yourself so that you know who to call if you become the victim of a cyber attack,” said Wray. “We are ready to help you build a crisis response plan so that when an intruder does come knocking, you’ll be prepared and like the Hive victims here, when you talk to us in advance…you will know how we operate quickly and quietly, giving you the assistance, the intelligence and the technical information that you want and you need.”Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": " The challenges facing chief information security officers (CISOs) have evolved dramatically in the past decade. Today, they must align their security efforts — and budgets — with the business goals of their organization, which may range from maintaining customer confidence that their data is safe to protecting intellectual property from theft.As a key member of the executive management team, CISOs often have board-level reporting responsibilities. They must manage a new and daunting level of technical complexity introduced by the cloud, where identities are virtually the first and last line of defense. And the job doesn't end there. To be successful, they must also put substantial effort into building a team with skills in a variety of disciplines, and choosing the right defensive technologies.Data-center-oriented companies that have transitioned to the cloud obviously face a new set of security concerns that conventional firewalls were never designed to handle. Hence, the now commonly heard refrain \"Identity is the new perimeter.\" This is certainly true. While firewalls and other network-based controls shouldn't be abandoned, CISOs need to focus on identity issues. The following three-step process can deliver results in this area quickly and efficiently.Correlate excess privileges and misconfigurations. Cloud misconfigurations are another serious risk. But when a privileged identity has access to a misconfigured cloud resource, the results can be disastrous. Fortunately, automated tools are now available to help detect misconfigurations, as well as excessive privileges, and remediate them to eliminate threats.Cloud engineering. The security team also needs to handle the day-to-day requirements of cloud security, which may include management, maintenance, and more. Competent cloud engineering is essential for \"keeping the lights on\" in the security sphere.One approach that works well as a supplement to hiring is development from within through training. This may occur in-house or through third-party certification programs. Also, in choosing vendors, organizations should favor those whose offerings include a strong training component. If possible, CISOs may find ways to get non-security employees to work on some security tasks.To sum up, the challenges facing today's CISOs are largely driven by the cloud, which creates a greatly expanded attack surface that needs to be protected. Meanwhile, mastering the management model and tools used by each cloud platform requires security expertise that is in extremely short supply. Solutions are available that provide the visibility and platform knowledge needed to help security teams implement best practices for protecting their cloud infrastructure, while helping them up-skill analysts in the process.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "title": "Finland’s Most-Wanted Hacker Nabbed in France – Krebs on Security",
      "text": " Julius “Zeekill” Kivimäki, a 25-year-old Finnish man charged with extorting a local online psychotherapy practice and leaking therapy notes for more than 22,000 patients online, was arrested this week in France. A notorious hacker convicted of perpetrating tens of thousands of cybercrimes, Kivimäki had been in hiding since October 2022, when he failed to show up in court and Finland issued an international warrant for his arrest.In late October 2022, Kivimäki was charged (and “arrested in absentia,” according to the Finns) with attempting to extort money from the Vastaamo Psychotherapy Center. In that breach, which occurred in October 2020, a hacker using the handle “Ransom Man” threatened to publish patient psychotherapy notes if Vastaamo did not pay a six-figure ransom demand.Vastaamo refused, so Ransom Man shifted to extorting individual patients — sending them targeted emails threatening to publish their therapy notes unless paid a 500-euro ransom.When Ransom Man found little success extorting patients directly, they uploaded to the dark web a large compressed file containing all of the stolen Vastaamo patient records.“It was a huge opsec [operational security] fail, because they had a lot of stuff in there — including the user’s private SSH folder, and a lot of known hosts that we could take a very good look at,” Kurittu told KrebsOnSecurity, declining to discuss specifics of the evidence investigators seized. “There were also other projects and databases.”Police responding to the scene were admitted by another woman — possibly a roommate — and found the man inside still sleeping off a long night. When they roused him and asked for identification, the 6′ 3″ blonde, green-eyed man presented an ID that stated he was of Romanian nationality.The French police were doubtful. After consulting records on most-wanted criminals, they quickly identified the man as Kivimäki and took him into custody.Kivimaki and other HTP members were involved in mass-compromising web servers using known vulnerabilities, and by 2012 Kivimäki’s alias Ryan Cleary was selling access to those servers in the form of a DDoS-for-hire service. Kivimäki was 15 years old at the time.The DDoS-for-hire service allegedly operated by Kivimäki in 2012.In 2013, investigators going through devices seized from Kivimäki found computer code that had been used to crack more than 60,000 web servers using a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe’s ColdFusion software.As KrebsOnSecurity reported at the time, this small ColdFusion botnet of data broker servers was being controlled by the same cybercriminals who’d assumed control over ssndob[.]ms, which operated one of the underground’s most reliable services for obtaining Social Security Number, dates of birth and credit file information on U.S. residents.Kivimäki also was involved in calling in multiple fake bomb threats and “swatting” incidents — reporting fake hostage situations at an address to prompt a heavily armed police response to that location.Kivimäki’s apparent indifference to hiding his tracks drew the interest of Finnish and American cybercrime investigators, and soon Finnish prosecutors charged him with an array of cybercrime violations. At trial, prosecutors presented evidence showing he’d used stolen credit cards to buy luxury goods and shop vouchers, and participated in a money laundering scheme that he used to fund a trip to Mexico.Kivimäki was ultimately convicted of orchestrating more than 50,000 cybercrimes. But largely because he was still a minor at the time (17) , he was given a 2-year suspended sentence and ordered to forfeit EUR 6,558.“The danger in such a decision is that it emboldens young malicious hackers by reinforcing the already popular notion that there are no consequences for cybercrimes committed by individuals under the age of 18.Kivimäki is now crowing about the sentence; He’s changed the description on his Twitter profile to “Untouchable hacker god.” The Twitter account for the Lizard Squad tweeted the news of Kivimäki’s non-sentencing triumphantly: “All the people that said we would rot in prison don’t want to comprehend what we’ve been saying since the beginning, we have free passes.”Something tells me Kivimäki won’t get off so easily this time, assuming he is successfully extradited back to Finland. A statement by the Finnish police says they are seeking Kivimäki’s extradition and that they expect the process to go smoothly.“Same thing,” Kivimäki replied. “Shall we start some kind of club? A support organization for wanted persons?”\r\n         This entry was posted on Sunday 5th of February 2023 11:14 AM \r\n         Interesting  article,   a guy  with  anger  issues  , that  does swatting, bomb threats  and  domestic violence , hacks into  a psychotherapy practice without  any remorse Who  see’s  the irony  here ?Fantastic news, and well done to all of the investigators involved! Kivimaki has been a menace to society, stealing money and blackmailing ever since he got a slap on the wrist for 50,000 counts of hacking. There are many reformed hackers, but Kivimaki is not one of them.Yes — string this career hacker criminal up by his thumbs, in Solitary Confinement, for the rest of his twisted life.  Far too many times these cybercrooks get a mild slap on the wrist and they’re back on the cyber highway after spreading their knowledge to anyone smart enough with whom they’re incarcerated.Make an example of this punk!I totally agree. All hackers need to be held accountable and given serious prison sentences.  Additionally, they should be prohibited from using any technology for their entire sentence.  They should be limited to only writing letters and sending them by snail mail or 5 minute monitored plain old trlephone calls  home.   Confinement should ensure that their technical skills go down the toilet forever.  Do not pamper these criminals.  I would rather see minor drug abusers be given a break and rehabilitation and let all these cyber criminals rot in prison.  These criminals are attacking medical organizations and that makes the violent criminals against the sick.Gutter criminal. Off with his head. (Not kidding)Zut alors!\nAleksanteri, bienvenue a la belle France!!!I have often traversed Romania with a “New Jersey passport”, but have yet to meet a 6’-3” Romanian male who resembled a blond, green-eyed, Nordic giant…Understood that this was a bad “fast guess” by you, when those gendarmerie rudely interrupted your slumber.\n(Aren’t the only blonds in Romania from a bleach bottle?)However, keep your spirits up and positive.\nLike the rest of us, into every data thug’s life, a little rain must fall…Remember, you are very lucky to be in the EU/Finland justice system. But in case you are extradited to the US, a few tips…\nEmphasize that you never used a gun for your alleged ill-gotten gains.\nNo gun in your crime, means 6 hours in a US jail unless the fraud was above US$1 million.\n(If you used a gun to rob $3.14 in the street, that’s 15 years for openers.)Yes, then you will get 3 hots and a cot, plus almost good health and dental care.\nBut avoid “Fat Albert” in cell block B…The wheels of human justice grind slowly Aleks, but inexorably…\nWe will somehow recover from missing you on Tik Tok…Weird spam is weird.like those he hurts & everyone else, dude has embarrassing secrets.\npls, someone, put him in his place & spill it.I wish he wouldn’t of gotten caught!!! All of the governments including there officials have been robbing the people. Modern day slavery. FREE HIM UNTIL ITS READ BACKWARDSGrow up. He destroyed people’s lives and if governments were not providing basic infrastructure people that need the Internet would not exist. The real survivalist live off the grid.This is really good news. I hope it will bring some kind of closure to the individuals affected especially by the absolutely shameless Vastaamo data breach and patient record publication.Who among us hasn’t accidentally uploaded our entire /home to the dark web? His arrogance seems unwarranted. Glad he’ll be out of circulation.Its honestly a wonder why he didn’t get caught sooner, being that stupid. Im legitimately bewildered as to how that happensGlad to see some of the worst of humans get a little suffering too, for a change.He used his keyboards/computers just like a gun in the back! He is a COWARD and a THUG that sneeks into our private and professional lives. It’s time for raising the amount of time and TRUTH in SENTENCING for CYBER CRIMINALS. Onec the thief is released keep him/them on paper for 10 yrs. C if these looser laugh at that!“I’d rather not be paid in imaginary money”…I enjoy these stories. Thank you Brian Krebs.Sadly, the Finnish criminal law system is notoriously lenient and understanding to criminals. If he gets 2 years (let alone more), that would be extraordinary. After that, the system is heavily geared towards integrating this PoS back into society.But of course things like this – bullying, abusing and extorting the vulnerable – is not something that is generally kindly looked on by hardcore criminals. Recently, a suspected child molester (who was apparently innocent, however) was beaten and tortured to death by other prisoners while in police custody in Finland.\nIt is entirely possible that Julius Kivimäki might have a very interesting jail time, involving one or more peculiar ‘accidents’.You cannot put child molesting on the same level as extortion. No one in prison will do that lolWho would attack a healthcare organization? That is really low. This is where folks are struggling to stay alive and you will go over and pull the plug to buy Gucci socks?  Even Satan stopped that. Lock him up for a long time and update the laws that allow these acts to persist. If you are truly smart with computers, use your skills for good and you will be rewarded by society.kyllästyi patonkiin? vois kirjottaa kirjan ja kääntyä uskoon tiilenpäitä lueskellessa?I think this kid needs a job and a wife. I say cut his index fingers clean off, tattoo a big shlong on his forhead and mutilate his toung. He will soon then seek mental health he saught to abuse in the passed. then release him. Let the world and life be his punishment“shifted to extorting individual patients — sending them targeted emails threatening to publish their therapy notes”\nThreatening psy patients? I wish for him some of them were not hard-boiled psychopath…It’s concerning to see the extent of damage that one individual can inflict through cybercrime. The fact that Julius Kivimäki has been involved in numerous hacking incidents, including the extortion and leak of therapy notes for thousands of patients, is alarming.\nHopefully, his arrest will serve as a warning to others who engage in similar activities, and reinforce the importance of cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information.Comments are closed.Mailing ListSearch KrebsOnSecurityRecent PostsStory CategoriesWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia"

The campaign abuses legitimate but compromised email accounts to send stolen data to external mail accounts controlled by the attackers.By: Mohamed Fahmy, Sherif Magdy, Mahmoud Zohdy\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFebruary 02, 2023\nRead time:  ( words)\n\tSave to FolioOn December 2022, we identified a suspicious executable (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.MSIL.REDCAP.AD) that was dropped and executed on multiple machines. Our investigation led us to link this attack to advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT34, and the main goal is to steal users’ credentials. Even in case of a password reset or change, the malware is capable of sending the new credentials to the threat actors. Moreover, after analyzing the backdoor variant deployed, we found the malware capable of new exfiltration techniques — the abuse of compromised mailbox accounts to send stolen data from the internal mail boxes to external mail accounts controlled by the attackers. While not new as a technique, this is the first instance that APT34 used this for their campaign deployment. Following this analysis, it is highly likely that this campaign’s routine is only a small part of a bigger chain of deployments. Users and organizations are strongly advised to reinforce their current security measures and to be vigilant of the possible vectors abused for compromise.RoutineIn this section, we describe the attack infection flow and its respective stages, as well as share details on how the group uses emails to steal and exfiltrate critical information.First Stage: Initial DroppersWe found the initial stage .Net dropper malware called MrPerfectInstaller (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.MSIL.REDCAP.AD) responsible for dropping four different files, with each component stored in a Base64 buffer inside the main dropper. It drops the following: The dropper also adds the following registry key to assist in implementing the password filter dropped earlier:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\Lsa \n Notification Packages = scecli, psgfilterThe main .Net binary implements two arguments for its operation: the first argument for installing the second stage, and the second argument for uninstalling it and unregistering the password filter dropped.Second Stage:  Abusing The Dropped Password Filter PolicyThese password filters can be abused by a threat actor as a method to intercept or retrieve credentials from domain users (domain controller) or local accounts (local computer). This is because for password filters to perform, password validation requires the password of the user in plaintext from the Local Security Authority (LSA). Therefore, installing and registering an arbitrary password filter could be used to harvest credentials every time a user changes his password. This technique requires elevated access (local administrator) and can be implemented with the following steps:Using this technique, the malicious actor can capture and harvest every password from the compromised machines even after the modification. The DLL has three export functions to implement the main functionality of support for registering the DLL into the LSA, as follows:When implementing the password filter export functions, the malicious actor took great care working with the plaintext passwords. When sent over networks, the plaintext passwords were first encrypted before being exfiltrated.Data Exfiltration Through Legitimate Mail TrafficThe main backdoor function (detected by Trend Micro as Backdoor.MSIL.REDCAP.A) receives the valid domain credentials as an argument and uses it to log on to the Exchange Server and use it for data exfiltration purposes. The main function of this stage is to take the stolen password from the argument and send it to the attackers as an attachment in an email. We also observed that the threat actors relay these emails via government Exchange Servers using vaild accounts with stolen passwords. First, the .Net backdoor parses a config file dropped in the main root path where it is executing from and checks for a file callled ngb inside <%ProgramData%\\WindowsSoftwareDevices\\DevicesTemp\\> to extract three parameters:However, the malware also supports for the modification of old passwords to new ones, which are sent through the registered DLL password filter. The malware proceeds to initialize an ExchangeService object in the first step and supplies the stolen credentials as WebCredentials to interface with the victim mail server in the second step. Using these Exchange Web Service (EWS) bindings, the malicious actor can send mails to external recipients on behalf of any stolen user and initialize a new instance of the WebCredentials class with the username and password for the account to authenticate.The malware then iterates through the files found under the target path. For each file found, it adds its path to a list, which will be exfiltrated later in the last step.The final stage is to iterate over the collected list of file paths. For each path, it prepares an EmailMessage object with the subject “Exchange Default Message”, and a mail body content of “Exchange Server is testing services.” The iteration attaches the whole file to this EmailMessage object and sends it using the previous initalized EWS form (Steps 1 and 2 in Figure 10), which already authenticated the user account.APT34 Targeting and Arsenal EvolutionFrom three previously documented attacks, we observed that while the group uses simple malware families, these deployments show the group's flexibility to write new malware based on researched customer environments and levels of access. This level of skill can make attribution for security researchers and reverse engineers more difficult in terms of tracking and monitoring because patterns, behaviors, and tools can be completely different for every compromise.While not at the top of the group’s list, other countries in the Middle East considered as targets are Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon, and Egypt.Attribution AnalysisThere are several data points and indicators that suggest APT34 carried out this attack, and that this group is still active in targeting countries in the Middle East with a special focus on compromising government entities.1.     The first stage dropper2.     Leveraging exchange servers for communications (Uni- and bidirectional)3.      The victim targetedConclusionsAt first glance, security teams can mistakenly tag the sample as safe or as a benign activity given the validity of the domains and mail credentials. It will take more experienced analysts to see that the domains abused is part of a bigger active directory domain “forest”, which share a trust relationship with each other to allow different government ministries or agencies to communicate. Considering we found a compromised account from one entity inside a sample sourced from a different agency indicates APT34 now has a deep foothold in the government domain forest.Following the stages executed, APT34’s repeated use of the Saitama backdoor technique in the first stage indicates a confidence that even the dated malware’s technique will continue to work and initiate compromise.The next stages for exfiltrating data, however, are considerably new and are considered exploratory for the group. Despite the routine's simplicity, the novelty of the second and last stages also indicate that this entire routine can just be a small part of a bigger campaign targeting governments. We continue tracking and monitoring the abuse of this threat to determine the depth and breadth of this compromise.Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)Emails abusedAdditional insights provided by AbdelRahman Yasser.Mohamed FahmyThreat Intelligence AnalystSherif MagdyThreat Intelligence AnalystMahmoud ZohdyThreat Intelligence AnalystTry our services free for 30 daysSelect a country / regionCopyright ©2023 Trend Micro Incorporated.

      "text": " Dashlane announced it had made the source code for its Android and iOS apps available on GitHub under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license.The popular subscription-based password manager and digital wallet have decided to release the code of its mobile apps to increase transparency in how they operate while also promoting a more collaborative and open development approach going forward.By making its mobile app's code available to anyone for exploration and auditing, the company hopes to receive feedback from the community on improving it and increased security vulnerability reports from cybersecurity researchers.The password manager maker says this \"opening up\" will also incentivize its engineers to \"level up\" the quality of the code and make it suitable for the masses to read and understand.Dashlane plans to update these code snapshots on GitHub every three months, but it might do it more frequently if the associated processes are enhanced accordingly.Open-sourcing software means making its code available to anyone for scrutiny, inherently increasing trust in the product.Moreover, it gives software engineers another example of how things are done, which is especially important when this example comes from a successful project.However, it's important to note that Dashlane has not transitioned to becoming an open-source project overnight, and for the time being, no direct contributions from the community can be accepted. Suggestions will still be welcomed and listened to, though.We should also clarify that the source code release concerns only the client apps for Android and iOS, so those of macOS and Windows remain closed-source.It's also worth noting that while the source code for the mobile client applications has been made publicly available, a significant portion of the password management system operates on Dashlane's servers and has not been released. This means that a substantial part of the product remains proprietary.This, of course, does not degrade the importance of this first step taken by Dashlane, and the software vendor has already promised that more will follow.The next product to be open-sourced, according to Dashlane, is its web browser extension, but this will happen after it has fully transitioned to meeting the Google Chrome MV3 requirements."

At publishing time we had yet to receive a reply.Before you put your money into any cryptocurrency project, research the token and the team behind it and look for red flags like incomplete data or too little information on the official website.Cryptocurrency investors should openly ask about a project in the community to hear the experience of other users. If you're getting into this trading game, it is recommended to use only reputable exchange services and diversify investments across different coins."

      "text": " The New York attorney general's office has announced a $410,000 fine for a stalkerware developer who used 16 companies to promote surveillance tools illegally.Stalkerware (or spyware) platforms allow their customers to monitor other people's phones without the users' knowledge. In some, if not most cases, they're also used to monitor the targets' online activity and collect sensitive user information like their location that later could be used for blackmail or various other malicious purposes.Patrick Hinchy, the spyware vendor, also agreed to alert his customers' victims that their phones are being secretly monitored using one of his multiple apps, including Auto Forward, Easy Spy, DDI Utilities, Highster Mobile, PhoneSpector, Surepoint, or TurboSpy.These surveillance apps enabled Hinchy's customers to secretly monitor what other individuals were doing on their mobile devices, including location, browsing history, call logs, text messages, photos and videos, email activity, WhatsApp and Skype chats, and social media activity.The stalkerware ads were also used to trick customers into believing that spying was legal even though installing such software on someone else's device without consent violates numerous state and federal laws.Snooping on a partner's phone without consent isn’t just a sign of an unhealthy relationship, it's against the law.\nToday, we stopped several companies from illegally promoting products that allowed spying on:\nCalls and texts\nPhotos and videos\nEmails and social media\"Snooping on a partner and tracking their cell phone without their knowledge isn't just a sign of an unhealthy relationship, it is against the law,\" Attorney General James said.\"These apps and products put New Yorkers at risk of stalking and domestic abuse, and were aggressively promoted by Patrick Hinchy through 16 different companies.\"Today's agreement will block these companies from allowing New Yorkers to be monitored without their awareness, and will continue our ongoing fight to protect New Yorkers' rights, safety, and privacy.\"This happened three years after an August 2018 data breach caused by an unprotected Amazon S3 bucket containing several terabytes of data harvested from over 3,600 devices."

It has also removed support for full DOM capture and enforces Google SSO login to improve account security.Regarding the deprecation of the old service, Mandatory told The Daily Swig that he had become “increasingly uncomfortable with the amount of vulnerability information stored in the service.“Ideally I’d like to be storing zero vulnerability information for XSS hunter users, which this deprecation will achieve,” he said.Mandatory described Truffle Security’s fork as “a step in the right direction” and said: “I think the fact that Truffle Security is starting out with an eye on balancing privacy and bug bounty research interests is a good sign.”“We saw an opportunity to both address privacy concerns as well as give the cybersecurity community new capabilities within the XSS Hunter tool,” Ayrey said.Ayrey said Mandatory was supportive of the effort and helped out in the process. Truffle Security plans to add more features to XSS Hunter in the future, including adding a more complete version of TruffleHog.“When I first built the service many people didn’t really believe that blind XSS was a ‘real’ concern,” he said. “Today I don’t think anyone doubts the pervasiveness and severity of these vulnerabilities, so it has pretty much achieved what it was meant to do.”Burp SuiteVulnerabilitiesCustomersCompanyInsights© 2023 PortSwigger Ltd."

      "text": " A new Android banking trojan has set its eyes on Brazilian financial institutions to commit fraud by leveraging the PIX payments platform.Italian cybersecurity company Cleafy, which discovered the malware between the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, is tracking it under the name PixPirate.It is also the latest addition in a long list of Android banking malware to abuse the operating system's accessibility services API to carry out its nefarious functions, including disabling Google Play Protect, intercepting SMS messages, preventing uninstallation, and serving rogue ads via push notifications.Besides stealing passwords entered by users on banking apps, the threat actors behind the operation have leveraged code obfuscation and encryption using a framework known as Auto.js to resist reverse engineering efforts.The dropper apps used to deliver PixPirate come under the garb of authenticator apps. There are no indications that the apps were published to the official Google Play Store.\"The introduction of ATS capabilities paired with frameworks that will help the development of mobile applications, using flexible and more widespread languages (lowering the learning curve and development time), could lead to more sophisticated malware that, in the future, could be compared with their workstation counterparts,\" the researchers said.The development also comes as Cyble shed light on a new Android remote access trojan codenamed Gigabud RAT targeting users in Thailand, Peru, and the Philippines since at least July 2022 by masquerading as bank and government apps.The web inject modules, mainly used for harvesting credentials and sensitive data, are designed to single out banking, mobile payment services, cryptocurrency exchanges, and mobile e-commerce applications spanning Asia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas.The technique entails employing social engineering methods such as approaching victims through dating apps like Tinder to entice them into downloading fraudulent investment apps with the goal of stealing their money.The malicious iOS apps in question are Ace Pro and MBM_BitScan, both of which have since been removed by Apple. An Android version of MBM_BitScan has also been taken down by Google.Cybersecurity firm Sophos, which made the discovery, said the iOS apps featured a \"review evasion technique\" that enabled the malware authors to get past the vetting process.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "title": "Operation Ice Breaker Targets The Gam(bl)ing Industry Right Before It's Biggest Gathering",
      "text": " Since this is a new threat actor, we are tracking it as Ice Breaker APT. Although research is still ongoing, we are releasing this article to reveal the attacker's Modus Operandi, attack chain, ways to mitigate the threat and supported IOCs, TTPs and Yara.\"Ice Breaker is using a very specific social engineering technique that somewhat sacrifices their identity\", said Senior Threat Researcher, Felipe Duarte.Although we haven't yet discovered Ice Breaker's whereabouts or preferred language, we are still interested in sharing the information we have with infosec community and the IT security of the gambling/gaming industry, as we are approaching the ICE London conference in February. This is the industry's largest conference in the world, hosting over 35,000 people. Our aim is to block the campaign while still researching more about its maker, Ice Breaker.The name \"Ice Breaker\" was born from the name of the main conference of this industry, \"ICE\", and the proximity of the campaign to its starting date, February 6th, 2023.Social engineering prior to sending malicious links to hide executables is a clever tactic, as this threat actor was well-aware of the fact that the customer service is human-operated. Without proper guidance for the teams on the other end, it almost seemed logical that an unregistered user would be having trouble logging in or registering, and thus the attacker sends links to images instead of embedding them in the chat.Convincing the human operator to open the ZIP or LNK file, the threat actor was only steps away from harvesting credentials, open a reverse shell and start the 2nd stage of the attack. Out of four incidents we've investigated, only one used DropBox as trusted downloader link. It was an option the attacker didn't choose initially, but following his frustration over transcripts of the conversation, when his screenshot lure did not follow through he had no other choice. The main payload they chose was something that hadn't been documented before. In this blog post, our team reveals pieces from the investigations to share the complexity of the 2nd stage, involving Node.js compiled binaries (.jsc) which are embedded in the malware executable and are being decoded at run-time. We were able to find the tool that is responsible for generating the bytecode of the .jsc, called Bytenode. As far as we know, generating a malware using this technique is easy; however, reverse engineering this bytecode back to the original source code is highly complex. While our team keeps researching ways to reverse engineer the bytecode, we are sharing this information with the infosec community in an attempt to gain more understanding into the process of creating that malware.It is important to highlight that many operators in the gaming/gambling industry provide support to their clients via dedicated channels handled by them, or in some cases they outsource this operation to specialized companies (BPOs) in an attempt to reduce the operational costs. Depending on the nature of this customer-business relationship, there are several risks associated that we cannot leave aside, and this is exactly what this APT actor is trying to exploit here.According to the infection attempts we've investigated, this attack vector could result in major damage if not properly protected and company's personnel not being trained to act against such scenarios and report immediately to security staff.The Modus Operadi of the attacker is to pretend to be a customer of the website with an issue, such logging in or registering, when in reality the \"visitor\" does not have an account. This should be the first indicator that something is not right.Based on the evidence collected by our team, it seems that all of the individuals carrying out the attacks are not English speakers, who intentionally choose to speak with non-native English customer service representatives, probably to reduce their chances of being detected as scams. As an example, in one of the incidents handled by our team, the attacker even asks for a Spanish speaker, and when approached with one, he immediately changes back to broken English.Incident #1 - Pretending to have a registration issue.Incident #2: The attacker chooses the French language in the customer service portal and shares links to ZIP files supposedly containing images. The proxy from which the attacker is connecting appears to be located in Japan. Incident #3: The attacker is requesting a Spanish-speaking agent, but continues to speak in English. In this example, it is easy to pick up the IDN Homograph Attack.Looking at the intrusions of this threat actor from the outside, without going into the details, we are dealing with a fairly simple control flow.The control flow consists of only two stages, each one with a clear objective.The threat actor is distributing two different types of payloads to the victim during the conversation. According to the data we have, the LNK file is the primary payload and it is the first one presented to the customer service agent. The VBS file, on the other hand, is only shared as a backup option in case the agent is unable to open the first file. Depending on the malicious file executed by the victim, either the LNK or the VBS, a different payload is provided. If the victim executes the LNK downloader, it will fetch and execute an additional MSI package containing an IceBreaker Backdoor, which is a new threat has not been previously described, as far as we know, in any other publicly available threat intelligence report. However, if the victim executes the VBS downloader, it will fetch the infamous Houdini RAT, a VBS-based Remote Access Trojan that has been active at least since since 2013. The threat actor is distributing LNK files via a set of domain names that mimic the legitimate domain \"screenshot[.]net\". Once the victim accesses it, the website presents a very simple view to download the allegedly \"screenshot\", in an attempt to deceive the customer service agent to download the malicious content (see Figure below).Once the customer service agent downloaded the decoy file supposedly to be the screenshot reported by the threat actor in the conversation, he/she was required to unzip its content and run the extracted LNK file on the machine. To make the threat more convincing to the victim, the icon of this Windows Shortcut was changed to match the default Windows picture icon, as shown in the image below.The purpose of the LNK file is fairly simple to understand, it downloads an additional MSI payload from its C2 server by abusing the trusted Windows binary msiexec.exe. Below, an example of the command executed by a malicious LNK file is provided, in it, it is also clear the attempt to impersonate one more time the official website screenshot[.]net by abusing some characters of the Unicode standard. The arguments in the command line are the following:/i : this argument is used to specify that the installer should perform an install operation./passive : this argument is used to display progress bar only, it does not prompt the user with any user interface./quiet : this argument runs the installer in quiet mode, with no user interaction./qn : this argument is used to run the installer with no user interface.Once that file was launched, our team was able to capture the execution flow, isolate the machine and begin the investigation. Having the knowledge of that user belonging to customer service immediately triggered a suspicion that this executable's origin is from an external service. The string that will contain the URL of the malicious server is initialize. It contains the \"http://\" string and some random data that will be removed later.The request object that will be used later to submit the data to the malicious server is initialized, and the malicious URL is completed. It contains the IP address of the malicious server hardcoded in an octal representation.The \"User-Agent\" header is set to the local time of the infected machine.The response of the server is gotten and executed. Once the connection has been established, it sends a POST request to an IP address converted in Octal which represents the value 178[.]63[.]65[.]51.Two different payloads are being used by this treat actor during the second stage of the attack. Among them only one stood out because it implements several techniques never seen before, in a public available report. We provide the details of each threat found during the investigation in the following subsections.Only when the victim downloaded and executed the secondary payload distributed during the conversation with the attacker, this threat is launched. The threat found during our research matches perfectly the behavior described by Mandiant in their report, the only difference is the C2 hardcoded in the script, which in this case was set to 194[.]5[.]97[.]17, as presented in the following picture.The MSI file downloaded and executed by the Windows shortcut is the starting point of this second stage. If the reader wants to follow the analysis of this threat, the details below could be used to download it from the OSINT platform of his/her preference.  The only relevant file inside this MSI package is a CAB archive, which acts as a second layer of protection and contains a compressed version of the malicious backdoor. The installer extracts this archive to the Temp folder, and finally, the third layer of the attack is executed.It doesn't really matter what modifications are made to the MSI package; its purpose is always the same: to drop and execute an embedded PE file called \"Port.exe.\" This embedded resource is the most interesting part of the attack. It is a PE file written in C++ and compiled for 64-bit systems. Its size is larger than the average malware sample typically handled by our team, and it contains many references to Node.js, including but not limited to its icon, several strings, and additional software properties.After a close inspection, something unusual was found in the overlay of this file. To clarify, the overlay of a PE file is a portion of data that is appended to the end of the original executable. This data is not loaded automatically by Windows when the file is executed because it is outside the PE structure. However, it is a fast and easy way to add additional resources required by the software without affecting the structure of the PE.Storing data in the overlay is not inherently malicious, but it is a technique commonly used by threat actors to:Bypass signature-based detectors by easily changing the hash of a PE file without modifying its structure or functionality.Make the process of analyzing the file more difficult by dramatically increasing the size of the file with random data, making it harder for analysis tools to handle.Hide additional resources such as other PE files and binaries that will be loaded during the execution of the file, particularly in droppers and packers.In this case, however, a very characteristic structure was found in the overlay. It wasn't just random data or highly obfuscated binaries that were left there by a packer or dropper. In this case, we were dealing with something additional: a type of binary data used by the JavaScript engine to speed up the parsing process of JavaScript code.Several attempts have been made to decompile this kind of code, but there is still a lack of tools that can keep up with these developments. In fact, based on our research, we have identified only two different projects that try to tackle this challenge using two different perspectives. According to our research, we found:None of the solutions above are suitable for analyzing this sample because they are incompatible with the Node.js version found in the samples (above 8.16.0). Our researchers are currently conducting additional analyses to address this issue and to help the community deal with this type of threat. However, we still obtained relevant results about the capabilities of the malicious JSC artifact by looking at its strings after extracting its contents from the overlay. As seen in the image below, which contains a snippet of the compiled JavaScript extracted from the sample, there are several strings that give us an idea about the scope of the malicious actions that this sample could execute on an infected machine.Based on the abovementioned, we concluded that we are dealing with a new modular backdoor written completely in Node.js and provides threat actors with a set of functionalities such as: Customization via plugins that extend the build-in features of the threat.Process discovery.Steal passwords and cookies from the local storage. It particularly targets Google Chrome.Persistence is achieved by creating a new LNK file in the startup folder \"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\WINN.lnk\".Exfiltrate files to the remote server via web sockets.Run custom VBS scripts in the infected machine.Take screenshots from the victim's machine.Generate remote shell sessions.All these capabilities in addition to the very low detection rate of the payload, which during this investigation, has remained close to zero even after 3 months of its first report (see image below), are the perfect recipe for the success of this threat actor. We are currently tracking this tool as the IceBreaker Backdoor, and we continue researching it to help community understand, identify and effectively respond against this new threat.We provide the following set of ideas to the infosec community in an attempt to help hunting this threat on your environments, feel free to test them and improve them if required.Look for LNK files created in the startup folder, and specially search for the name WINN.lnk.Look for any unauthorized execution of the open-source tool tsocks.exe in your environment. You can hunt this by looking for new processes created with that name or following the structure of the commands used by this tool. Monitor closely the creation of msiexec.exe processes receiving URLs as parameters.Monitor closely the execution of VBS scripts and LNK files launched from the Temp folder.

      "title": "Scammers managed to slip crypto apps onto Apple, Google app stores",
      "text": " Scammers were able to get two fraudulent apps onto the app stores run by both Google and Apple that allowed them to push users into making fake cryptocurrency investments, according to a new report. Researchers from Sophos said they discovered Ace Pro and MBM_BitScan on both Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store. The apps are part of a scheme – now known colloquially as “pig butchering” – where scammers develop a relationship with victims, get them to download an app and then eventually get them to deposit money onto the app.Jagadeesh Chandraiah, senior threat researcher at Sophos, said in one case, the scammers created a fake profile of a woman living a lavish life in London. They developed a relationship with a victim and urged them to download the Ace Pro app – which masquerades as a QR code scanner.But once the app is downloaded, users see a fraudulent crypto trading platform that urges them to deposit currency. All of the funds deposited go directly to the scammers. One victim that contacted Sophos only discovered the apps were fraudulent after losing $4,000.Chandraiah said it was most surprising that the apps made it onto Apple’s App Store considering how hard it generally is to get malware past the company’s security review process. While other malicious apps have been found on the Play Store, this is the first time Sophos found fraudulent apps on Apple’s store in their two years examining pig butchering scams.Scammers previously had to go through far more technical trouble to get Apple users to download fake apps, and many victims figured out something was wrong when they couldn't simply download an app directly. “By getting an application onto the App Store, the scammers have vastly increased their potential victim pool, particularly since most users inherently trust Apple,” Chandraiah said. “Both apps are also not affected by iOS’ new Lockdown mode, which prevents scammers from loading mobile profiles helpful for social engineering. In fact, these CryptoRom scammers may be shifting their tactics—i.e., focusing on bypassing the App Store review process—in light of the security features in Lockdown.” But once the app was approved, the scammers were able to redirect it to a domain registered in an unnamed country in Asia. The other app, MBM_BitScan, is known as BitScan on Google Play and both apps communicate with the same Command and Control (C2) infrastructure which communicates with a server that resembles a legitimate Japanese crypto firm. Both Google and Apple were notified by Sophos about the apps and both companies said they removed them. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. A Google spokesperson told The Record: “The Android app identified as malicious in the report has been removed from Google Play and the developer has been banned.\"Sophos was initially alerted to the scam apps by victims, kicking off their two-year investigation into the trend. “Pig butchering” scams have become wildly popular among cybercriminals as online dating has exploded and more people have become comfortable with sending money digitally. “CryptoRom and other forms of “pig butchering” initially targeted people in China and Taiwan. Early scams focused on online gambling with insider information, using similar tactics to CryptoRom. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scams expanded globally and evolved into fraudulent foreign exchange and cryptocurrency trading. We are tracking this threat actor as the ‘ShaZhuPan’ group,” Chandraiah said. “When Chinese authorities started cracking down on these scams and prosecuted some perpetrators, some of the gangs behind them fled to smaller southeast Asian countries, including Cambodia, where they now operate in special economic zones (SEZ).”Many – being trafficked from countries like India, China and Malaysia – had their passports confiscated and were forced to work for these operations to get their passports back. They are given scripts to follow when approaching victims and instructions on how to get victims to send money. Sophos noted that while it may seem far-fetched that anyone would fall for these scams, the victims they spoke to were almost always well-educated. Most victims noted that their relationships with the scammers lasted months and that they were allowed to make small profits from their initial transactions on the fraudulent financial websites or apps. Many of the scammers also share fake screenshots of the money they are purportedly making from the fraudulent platforms. Most of the victims who spoke to Sophos said they had recently dealt with a major life change and were emotionally vulnerable to this kind of operation, where scammers contacted them daily and shared mundane life updates.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " An ongoing Google ads malvertising campaign is spreading malware installers that leverage KoiVM virtualization technology to evade detection when installing the Formbook data stealer.KoiVM is a plugin for the ConfuserEx .NET protector that obfuscates a program's opcodes so that the virtual machine only understands them. Then, when launched, the virtual machine translates the opcodes back to their original form so that the application can be executed.\"Virtualization frameworks such as KoiVM obfuscate executables by replacing the original code, such as NET Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instructions, with virtualized code that only the virtualization framework understands,\" explains a new report by SentinelLabs.\"A virtual machine engine executes the virtualized code by translating it into the original code at runtime.\"\"When put to malicious use, virtualization makes malware analysis challenging and also represents an attempt to evade static analysis mechanisms.\"Sentinel Labs comments that while KoiVM virtualization is popular for hacking tools and cracks, it is seldom used in malware distribution.Instead, the security firm believes the new trend in its use might be one of the multiple side effects of Microsoft's disabling of macros in Office.In the ongoing campaign seen by SentinelLabs, threat actors push the MalVirt loaders in ads pretending to be for the Blender 3D software.The downloads offered by these fake sites utilize invalid digital signatures impersonating Microsoft, Acer, DigiCert, Sectigo, and AVG Technologies USA.While these invalid signatures will not trick Windows into showing them as signed, the MalVirt loaders still pack features to avoid detection.\"For example, some samples patch the AmsiScanBuffer function implemented in amsi.dll to bypass the Anti Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) that detects malicious PowerShell commands,\" explains researcher A. Milenkoski.\"Further, in an attempt to evade static detection mechanisms, some strings (such as amsi.dll and AmsiScanBuffer) are Base-64 encoded and AES-encrypted.\"The loaders can also detect if they run in a virtualized environment by querying specific registry keys, and if they do, the execution stops to evade analysis.MalVirt also uses a signed Microsoft Process Explorer driver loaded at system start-up as \"TaskKill,\" enabling it to modify running processes to dodge detection.To also evade the decompilation of the virtualized code, the loaders also use a modified version of KoiVM that features additional obfuscation layers, making its decyphering even more challenging.SentinelLabs says this custom KoiVM implementation confuses standard devirtualization frameworks like the 'OldRod' by obfuscating its routine through arithmetic operations instead of using straightforward assignments.Milenkoski says it's possible to defeat the obfuscation in these MalVirt loaders and restore the original order of KoiVM's 119 constant variables.However, the additional obfuscation makes it difficult, requiring hefty manual labor since existing automated tools cannot help.In addition to all detection avoidance systems used in the malware loader, a new trick is employed by Formbook itself that helps disguise its real C2 (command and control) traffic and IP addresses.The info-stealing malware mixes its real traffic with various \"smokescreen\" HTTP requests whose content is encrypted and encoded so they don't stand out.The malware communicates with those IPs randomly, picking them out of a hardcoded list with domains hosted by various companies.SentinelLabs says that in the samples it analyzed, it saw Formbook communicating with 17 domains, only one of which was the actual C2 server, and the rest serving as mere decoys to confuse network traffic monitoring tools.This is a novel system on a pretty old malware strain, indicating that its operators are interested in empowering it with new features that will make it better at staying hidden from security tools and analysts.Whether or not threat actors have completely switched malspam distribution of Formbook to Google search advertisements remains to be seen, but it's another example that users need to be very careful of the links they click in search results."

      "text": " Data-storage hardware vendor QNAP is warning customers to update their devices after the discovery of a vulnerability that exposes thousands to attacks. “The vulnerability is not actively exploited now,” a spokesperson for QNAP told The Record.The bug was discovered by a third-party researcher and reported through the company's Security Bounty Program, the spokesperson said.“Censys has observed 67,415 hosts with indications of running a QNAP-based system; unfortunately, we could only obtain the version number from 30,520 hosts. But, if the advisory is correct, over 98% of identified QNAP devices would be vulnerable to this attack,” Censys senior security researcher Mark Ellzey said. “We found that of the 30,520 hosts with a version, only 557 were running QuTS Hero greater than or equal to ‘h5.0.1.2248’ or QTS greater than or equal to ‘5.0.1.2234,’ meaning 29,968 hosts could be affected by this vulnerability.”The country with the most vulnerable hosts was the United States, which had more than 3,200. Italy, Taiwan, Germany and Japan were not far behind. Mark Ellzey, senior security researcher at Censys, told The Record on Friday that the number of vulnerable devices moved up to 31,567.\"There is good reason for this; most of these devices live on residential networks (a residential network is an ISP that people use in their homes, (FIOS, Comcast, etc),\" he said. \"For example, HINET Data Communications provides broadband services to small businesses and local residents. HINET saw 322 new QNAP devices come online. Networks like these are the networks of normal everyday people, not high-availability server farms, so you're going to see an ebb and flow of listening services as people log in and log out of their internet.\"\"There is no indication of Deadbolt infections so far -- but given that the group was targeting QNAP devices before, there is a decent chance they are working on finding this vulnerability now,\" Ellzey said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " “One of the victims was in the health care research vertical within India. In recent years the Indian research and technology sector has been a common target of those North Korean threat groups with a focus on intelligence collection,” the researchers said. “Other victims of this campaign identified by WithSecure included health care research, a manufacturer of technology used in energy, research, defense, and health care verticals, as well as the chemical engineering department of a leading research university.”The researchers named the campaign “No Pineapple” due to an error message that was found in the code of a backdoor tool found during their investigation. The hackers used the bugs to gain access to a Zimbra mail server at the end of August 2022 and likely exfiltrated the contents of the mailboxes. By October 2022, the group moved laterally to another vulnerable device on the network and used malware to eventually steal 100 GB of data on November 5. Despite the massive amounts of data stolen, the group never took destructive actions while in the victim network.The researchers attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group based on the malware used and several operational mistakes made by the group during their intrusion. The infrastructure used by the group during the attack has been tied to previous Lazarus campaigns identified by other security companies.“The overall toolkit of the threat actor is very similar to other reported instances of North Korean groups,” the researchers said. “The usage of Dtrack and Grease malware has been previously associated with Kimsuky, while Dtrack is also in the Lazarus arsenal. The toolkit aligns with other reporting of this campaign from Talos Intelligence and Symantec.”The researchers were also able to tie the activity to North Korea based on the hours of operation, noting that most of the actions took place between 00:00 to 15:00 UTC (09:00 and 21:00 UTC +9) and between Monday and Saturday – a work pattern common for those in North Korea. They also found connections to a North Korea IP address that WithSecure concluded was “an operational security failure by the threat actor.”“This is significant as the only North Korean IP addresses are three /24 networks which are directly controlled and used by the North Korean government, and as such it is extremely likely that this activity was initiated by a North Korean state actor,” they said. WithSecure said Lazarus group operates within the 3rd Bureau of North Korean People’s Army – a unit tasked with intelligence gathering and technological/commercial espionage.The report on the incident also notes that there is significant overlap in the tools used by different hacking groups within the North Korean military. The attack used tools typically deployed by Kimsuky – a group attributed to North Korea’s 5th Bureau that focuses on hacking targets in South Korea – as well as APT37 which is based within the Ministry of State Security and also focuses on South Korea. Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Security researchers warn that hackers may start using Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) more often as method to achieve persistence and execute code on a target machine via malicious Office add-ins.The technique is an alternative to sneaking into documents VBA macros that fetch malware from an external source. However, using VSTO introduce an attack vector that allows building .NET-based malware and embedding it into the Office add-in.VSTO is a software development kit, part of Microsoft's Visual Studio IDE. It is used to build VSTO add-ins, which are extensions for Office applications that can execute code on the machine.These add-ins can be packaged with the document files or downloaded from a remote location and are executed when launching the document with the associated Office app (e.g. Word, Excel)Threat actors prefer using the local VSTO approach, which does not require bypassing trust-related security mechanisms to execute the add-in code. However, Deep Instinct noticed some attacks using remote VSTO add-ins.A sign of these payload-carrying documents is the presence of a \"custom.xml\" parameter that gives the Office application instructions on where to locate the add-in and to install it.The dependencies of the add-in payload are stored together with the document, typically inside an ISO container. The threat actors set these extra files to \"hidden,\" hoping that the victim misses them and assumes the archive only contains a document.After launching the document, a prompt appears asking to install the add-in. Attackers can trick the victim to allow the action in a similar way as with the \"enable content\" pop-up for enabling malicious VBA macros to execute.In one attack that Deep Instinct saw targeting users in Spain, the add-in payload executed an encoded and compressed PowerShell script on the computer.In another example that involved a remote VSTO-based add-in, the threat actors set the .DLL payload to download a password-protected ZIP archive and drop it into the \"%\\AppData\\Local\\ folder.\" Deep Instinct could not retrieve the final payload due to the server being offline at the time of its investigation.Deep Instinct researchers expect more threat actors to integrate VSTO into their attacks. They believe that \"nation-state and other 'high caliber' actors\" will jump at the opportunity as they are more likely to have the means to bypass trust mechanism used in Windows by using valid code signing certificates."

      "text": " Nearly $4 billion was stolen in cyberattacks on cryptocurrency platforms in 2022, fueled in large part by hackers working on behalf of the North Korean government. Chainalysis researchers told The Record that hackers especially targeted cross-chain bridge protocols – tools that let users port their cryptocurrency from one blockchain to another. Of the $3.1 billion stolen from DeFi platforms, 64% came from cross-chain bridge protocols.“These events target the sinew between blockchains and DeFi projects, and often, they successfully compromise hundreds of millions of USD equivalent value,” they said.Hackers with North Korea’s Lazarus Group and others were responsible for $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency theft in 2022, shattering their own records. Chainalysis noted that in 2020, the country’s total exports were just $142 million, making the crypto hacks a “sizable chunk of the nation’s economy.”Following the sanctions, Chainalysis found that North Korean actors began to diversify their use of mixing services. While some funds are still laundered through Tornado Cash, the country’s hackers also use services like Sinbad, a relatively new Bitcoin mixer.“As we’ve seen in many North Korea-directed hacks, the hackers bridge the stolen funds from the Ethereum blockchain — including a portion of the funds stolen in the Axie Infinity hack — to Bitcoin, then send that Bitcoin to Sinbad,” Chainalysis researchers said. In December and January, North Korea-linked hackers sent $24.2 million worth of Bitcoin to Sinbad. The researchers said there is no indication that cryptocurrency hacks will slow down in 2023. “However, over time we hope to see hacking decrease not just as it becomes more difficult to steal funds, but also launder and cash them out, given the transparency of the blockchain,” they said.“Similar to how our industry came together after the endless hacking of centralized exchanges in 2019, we need to do the same in DeFi. Given the losses and the promise of DeFi as an antidote to some of the shortcomings that lead to the collapse of FTX, I believe we’ll see a great deal of collaboration and progress in this space.”The report from Chainalysis coincided with a hack on a cryptocurrency platform named BonqDAO, in which $120 million was allegedly stolen.Blockchain research firm PeckShield confirmed to The Record that they believe $98 million worth of the Bonq Euro (BEUR) coin and $11 million in AllianceBlock (ALBT) coin was stolen.

      "text": " A new cyber espionage campaign dubbed 'No Pineapple!' has been attributed to the North Korean Lazarus hacking group, allowing the threat actors to stealthily steal 100GB of data from the victim without causing any destruction.The campaign lasted between August and November 2022, targeting organizations in medical research, healthcare, chemical engineering, energy, defense, and a leading research university.WithSecure was able to attribute the activity based on multiple pieces of evidence but also noticed some new developments for Lazarus, like:The campaign is named after the '< No Pineapple! >' error seen transmitted by a remote access malware when uploading stolen data to the threat actor's servers.The Lazarus hackers compromised the victim's network on August 22nd, 2022, by leveraging the CVE-2022-27925 (remote code execution) and CVE-2022-37042 (authentication bypass) Zimbra vulnerabilities to drop a webshell on the target's mail server.After successfully breaching the network, the hackers deployed the tunneling tools 'Plink and '3Proxy' to create reverse tunnels back to the threat actors' infrastructure, allowing the threat actors to bypass the firewall.Less than a week after, WithSecure says the intruders began utilizing modified scripts to extract approximately 5GB of email messages from the server and save them to a locally stored CSV file, which was later uploaded to the attacker's server.Over the next two months, the threat actors spread laterally through the network, acquiring administrator credentials and stealing data from devices.While spreading through the network, Lazarus deployed multiple custom tools, such as Dtrack and what is believed to be a new version of the GREASE malware, used to locate Windows administrator accounts.Dtrack is an information-stealing backdoor known to be used by Lazarus, while the GREASE malware is associated with Kimusky, another North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.The attack culminated on November 5th, 2022, with the actors lurking in the network for over two months and ultimately stealing 100GB of data from the compromised organization. WithSecure was able to analyze the work patterns of the threat actors, stating that they worked Monday through Saturday from 9 AM to 10 PM.\"Time zone attribution analysis concluded that the time zone aligns with UTC +9. Reviewing activity by time of day finds that most threat actor activity occurred between 00:00 to 15:00 UTC (09:00 and 21:00 UTC +9),\" shared WithSecure.\"Analysing activity by day of the week suggests that the threat actor was active Monday to Saturday, a common work pattern for DPRK.\"The first notable change found in this Lazarus campaign is that they now rely solely on IP addresses without domain names for their infrastructure.This change has advantages for the threat actors, including reduced need for renewal maintenance and greater IP flexibility.Instead, it relies on a separate backdoor to transfer the data it has gathered locally on the compromised machine, storing them in a password-protected archive.\"The staging and exfiltration host was likely carefully chosen by the threat actor to be a host where endpoint security monitoring tools were not deployed,\" explains WithSecure in the report.Its main difference compared to previous versions is that it now uses RDPWrap to install an RDP service onto the host to create a privileged user account with the help of net user commands.WithSecure's investigation of retrieved network logs from the victim revealed that one of the web shells planted by the intruders was communicating with a North Korean IP address (\"175.45.176[.]27\").This isolated incident occurred at the beginning of that day, preceded by connections from a proxy address, indicating that the threat actor likely exposed themselves by an error at the start of their workday.Additionally, WithSecure observed that various commands executed on the breached network devices were very similar to those hardcoded inside Lazarus malware but often contained mistakes and didn't execute, indicating that the threat actors were typing them manually using the Impacket 'atexec' module.Apart from the mistakes, WithSecure was able to link these operations to Lazarus based on TTP overlaps detailed in previous reports by Symantec and Cisco Talos, the employed malware strains, the profiles of the targets, infrastructure overlaps, and time-zone analysis.WithSecure's report is another indication of Lazarus' activity, with the threat group continuing its efforts to gather intelligence and exfiltrate large amounts of data from high-profile victims."

It was found and reported by security researchers Sam Quinn and Kasimir Schulz with the Trellix Advanced Research Center.Successful exploitation in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction enables remote authenticated threat actors to execute commands with root permissions on the underlying operating system.The company says the vulnerability affects Cisco devices running IOS XE software, but only if they don't support native docker.Besides IOS XE-based devices configured with IOx, the list of impacted devices also includes 800 Series Industrial ISR routers, CGR1000 compute modules, IC3000 industrial compute gateways, IR510 WPAN industrial routers, and Cisco Catalyst access points (COS-APs).The company also confirmed that the CVE-2023-20076 flaw doesn't affect Catalyst 9000 Series switches, IOS XR and NX-OS software, or Meraki products.Attackers can only exploit this vulnerability if they have authenticated administrative access to the vulnerable systems.However, the Trellix researchers explained that threat actors exploit other security flaws allowing privilege escalation, or can use various tactics to obtain admin credentials.For instance, to gain admin access to the targeted devices, they can use:\"Side-stepping this security measure means that if an attacker exploits this vulnerability, the malicious package will keep running until the device is factory reset or until it is manually deleted.\"This is possible because the command injection enables bypassing mitigations put in place by Cisco to prevent vulnerability persistence between system reboots or system resets.Cisco's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) says it found no evidence that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild."

      "text": " Scammers used a malicious DocuSign document in a campaign that tried to steal credentials belonging to more than 10,000 people across several organizations. Researchers at cybersecurity company Armorblox said the brand impersonation campaign targeted Microsoft Office 365 email accounts and managed to bypass other security tools. The subject of the emails was “Please DocuSign: Approve Document 2023-01-11” in an attempt to make victims think the email was urgent and needed to be opened as soon as possible. While the email address and domain name had no association with DocuSign, the scammers were relying on the fact that it can be hard to see these names – particularly on mobile devices where many people typically read their emails. The researchers noted that DocuSign attacks are particularly successful for scammers because people are used to getting these kinds of emails before and after signing documents through the platform. “The language used within the body of the email continues to impersonate the well-known brand DocuSign,” the researchers said. “Through the inclusion of statements around alternate shipping methods, a blurb about the company DocuSign, and even a disclaimer to not share this email with anybody else, unsuspecting victims who fell for the attackers’ manipulating tactics and opened the email would have been presented with additional language and information aimed to establish trust in the victims and encourage he or she to click on the main link that reads: VIEW COMPLETED DOCUMENT.”The goal of the email was to get users to click on the button, which would take them to a fake landing page that impersonated cybersecurity firm Proofpoint. The page had Proofpoint branding and a PDF icon urging the person to clock on the document in order to view it. The landing page had several hallmarks of legitimacy, including a fake checkmark resembling verification from cybersecurity company Symantec and even the inclusion of the person’s email address. The goal was to get people to enter their credentials for Proofpoint. Armorblox did not say if any of the emails were successful, but the campaign builds on a longstanding trend of hackers using platforms like DocuSign to manipulate people into handing over valuable credentials. “There's a good chance that most recipients have had professional or personal interaction with those services. Although PDF and HTML attachments were very common, the top phishing vector was still a rogue URL link in an email,” said KnowBe4’s Roger Grimes.“Users need to always hover over any links embedded in any email and examine it for legitimacy before clicking on it. Fake HR, human resource, requests were also a top clicked simulated phishing topic, accounting for nearly a third of all clicked phishing tests.” Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Pro-Russian hacktivist group Killnet this week launched distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on networks belonging to 14 major US hospitals in its continuing retaliation campaign against entities in countries the threat actor perceives as hostile to Russian interests in Ukraine.The attacks — like most Killnet attacks since Russia's invasion last February — appear to have done little to seriously disrupt network operations at any of the targeted organizations, which included Stanford Health, Michigan Medicine, Duke Health, and Cedars-Sinai.That said, they are likely going to garner Killnet more support from other like-minded hacktivists in Russia and elsewhere, and possibly even fuel investments into its operations from others, making them more dangerous in the process, security experts said this week.\"Killnet has been actively attacking anyone who supports Ukraine or goes against Russia for almost 12 months now,\" says Pascal Geenens, director of threat intelligence at Radware. \"They have been dedicated to their cause and have had the time to build experience and increase their circle of influence across affiliate pro-Russian hacktivist groups.\"Killnet's latest DDoS campaign this week against hospitals in the US and medical institutions in multiple other countries, including Germany, Poland, and the UK, were likely motivated by the recent US-led decision by NATO countries to send battle tanks to Ukraine. However, the impact of these attacks remains questionable.Mary Masson, director of public relations at Michigan Medicine, for instance, says Killnet's DDoS attacks hit multiple of its websites on Jan. 30, including uofmhealth.org and mottchildren.org. Masson describes the attacks as causing \"intermittent problems\" for some of Michigan Medicine's public-facing websites hosted by a third-party service provider. \"None of the sites impacted contain patient information, and all patient information is safe,\" she notes. \"Patients were always still able to access the patient portal via myuofmhealth.org.\" The websites were all back to almost normal operations a day later, on Jan. 31.Sally Stewart, associate director of media relations at Cedars-Sinai, describes Killnet's DDoS attack as having a similarly low impact on the hospital's operations: \"The Cedars-Sinai website experienced a brief service interruption early Monday morning that has resolved. The website remains fully functional,\" Stewart said in an emailed statement to Dark Reading.Stanford Healthcare and Duke Health did not immediately respond to Dark Reading's request for comment.\"They are not as disruptive as they claim to be,\" Geenens says, adding that Killnet’s main objective is attracting attention and getting their pro-Russian message heard. \"They go after targets that are visible to the larger public, such as public websites of institutions, governments, and organizations.\" Often the resources the group has targeted are not business-critical. That does not mean the group can be ignored, however. In an advisory following the recent DDoS attacks, the American Hospital Association described Killnet as an active threat to the healthcare industry. Importantly, Killnet's pro-Russian DDoS crusade has also begun attracting many more followers and fans. Daniel Smith, head of cyber-threat intelligence at Radware, says the number of subscribers for @Killnet_reserve on Telegram grew from about 34,000 subscribers to 85,000 subscribers in June 2022. \"Just for comparison, IT Army of Ukraine has over 200,000 subscribers, but has been losing subscribers since March 2022,\" he says.The group has focused quite a bit on publicity via its Telegram channel, which it also uses to encourage followers to conduct DDoS attacks of their own.\"Killnet’s influence, reach, and skills are growing, and they are not showing signs of slowing down or retiring soon,\" Geenens warns.What makes the group now potentially more dangerous are its growing reach and skills, Radware's Smith adds. A few months ago, Radware's assessment of the risk posed by a pro-Russian hacktivist group such as Killnet would have been low, he explains. \"But after 12 months of building their experience,\" he says, \"advancing their tools and growing their social network, I’m more likely to increase that risk to moderate.\"While there's no reason for panic, it is better to err on the side of caution and be prepared. \"Everyone in the security community knows it does not take extremely skilled or sophisticated actors to disrupt or cause impact to an organization or infrastructure,\" Smith adds.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " New stealthy malware designed to hunt down vulnerable Redis servers online has infected over a thousand of them since September 2021 to build a botnet that mines for Monero cryptocurrency.Discovered by Aqua Security researchers Nitzan Yaakov and Asaf Eitani, who dubbed it HeadCrab, the malware has so far ensnared at least 1,200 such servers, which are also used to scan for more targets online.\"We discovered not only the HeadCrab malware but also a unique method to detect its infections in Redis servers. Our method found approximately 1,200 actively infected servers when applied to exposed servers in the wild.\"The threat actors behind this botnet take advantage of the fact that Redis servers don't have authentication enabled by default, as they are designed to be used within an organization's network and shouldn't be exposed to Internet access.If admins don't secure them and accidentally (or intentionally) configure them to be accessible from outside their local network, attackers can easily compromise and hijack them using malicious tools or malware.Once they gain access to servers that don't require authentication, the malicious actors issue a 'SLAVEOF' command to synchronize a master server under their control to deploy the HeadCrab malware onto the newly hijacked system.​After being installed and launched, HeadCrab provides the attackers with all the capabilities required to take complete control of the targeted server and add it to their cryptomining botnet.It also deletes all logs and only communicates to other servers controlled by its masters to evade detection.\"The attacker communicates with legitimate IP addresses, primarily other infected servers, to evade detection and reduce the likelihood of being blacklisted by security solutions,\" the researchers added.\"The malware is primarily based on Redis processes which are unlikely to be flagged as malicious. Payloads are loaded through memfd, memory-only files, and kernel modules are loaded directly from memory, avoiding disk writes.\"While analyzing the malware, they also found that the attackers mainly use mining pools hosted on previously compromised servers to complicate attribution and detection.Furthermore, the Monero wallet linked to this botnet showed that the attackers are raking in an estimated annual profit of around $4,500 per worker, a lot higher than the usual $200/worker similar operations make.To defend their Redis servers, admins are advised to ensure that only clients within their networks can access them, to disable the \"slaveof\" feature if it's unused, and enable protected mode, which configures the instance to only respond to the loopback address and refuse connections from other IP addresses.Update February 03, 10:27 EST: A Redis spokesperson sent the following statement after the article was published:We should note that there are no signs that Redis Enterprise software or Redis Cloud services have been impacted by these attacks."

      "text": " A threat actor named InTheBox is promoting on Russian cybercrime forums an inventory of 1,894 web injects (overlays of phishing windows) for stealing credentials and sensitive data from banking, cryptocurrency exchange, and e-commerce apps.The overlays are compatible with various Android banking malware and mimic apps operated by major organizations used in dozens of countries on almost all continents.Being available in such numbers and at low prices, allows cybercriminals to focus on other parts of their campaigns, development of the malware, and to widen their attack to other regions.Typically, mobile banking trojans check what apps are present on an infected device and pull from the command and control server the web injects corresponding to the apps of interest.When the victim launches a target app, the malware automatically loads the overlay that mimics the interface of the legitimate product.InTheBox provides up-to-date injects for hundreds of apps, researchers at threat intelligence company Cyble discovered.For those who don't want to buy entire packages, InTheBox also sells web injects individually for $30 each. The shop also allows users to order custom injects for any malware.InTheBox's web inject packages include app icon PNGs and an HTML file with JavaScript code that collects the victim's credentials and other sensitive data.In most cases, the injects feature a second overlay that requests the user to enter credit card numbers, expiration dates, and CVV numbers.Cyble says that InTheBox's injects can check the validity of the credit card numbers entered by victims using the Luhn algorithm, which helps Android malware operators filter out invalid data.Finally, the stolen data is converted into string value and sent to a server controlled by the operator of the Android banking trojan.InTheBox has been selling web injects for Android malware since February 2020, constantly adding new pages that target more banks and financial apps.Cyble was able to confirm that InTheBox's web injects have been used by the 'Coper' and the 'Alien' Android trojans in 2021 and September 2022, respectively, while the most recent campaign occurred in January 2023 and targeted Spanish banks."

By filtering vulnerable packages in use, companies can focus their efforts on a smaller amount of the fixable vulnerabilities that represent genuine risk.Additionally, the research document suggests that 59% of containers have no CPU limits defined, and 69% of all requested CPU resources typically remain unused, thus resulting in (often) significant overspending for companies.“Looking back at last year’s report, container adoption continues to mature, which is evident by the decrease in container life spans,” said Sysdig director of cybersecurity strategy Michael Isbitski.“However, misconfigurations and vulnerabilities continue to plague cloud environments, and supply chains are amplifying how security problems manifest.”In fact, according to the executive, this prevents organizations from gathering troubleshooting information and reinforces the need for security solutions to retain information despite the temporary nature of the cloud.“Permissions management, for users and services alike, is another area I’d love to see people get stricter about,” Isbitski added.The report analyzed more than seven million containers that Sysdig customers run daily. The company said it also pulled from public data sources like GitHub, Docker Hub and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).Quality-wise, the anonymized data originates from container deployments across a wide range of industries and mid-market-to-large enterprise organizations. The customer data was analyzed across North and South America, Australia, the EU, the UK and Japan.“This year’s report shows great growth and also outlines best practices that I hope teams adopt by the 2024 report, such as looking at in-use exposure to understand real risk and to prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities that are truly impactful,” Isbitski concluded."

They can be abused to inject maliciously crafted files into the operating system of impacted appliances.VMware also fixed a deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2022-31710) which triggers denial of service states, and an information disclosure bug (CVE-2022-31711) that attackers can use to gain access to sensitive session and application info.​\"This vulnerability is easy to exploit however, it requires the attacker to have some infrastructure setup to serve malicious payloads,\" the researchers said.\"Additionally, since this product is unlikely to be exposed to the internet, the attacker likely has already established a foothold somewhere else on the network. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution as root, essentially giving an attacker complete control over the system.\"While there are only a few dozen instances publicly exposed on the internet, according to Shodan data, this is to be expected given that VMware vRealize Log Insight appliances are designed to be accessed from inside an organization's network.However, it's not uncommon for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in already compromised networks for lateral movement, making vulnerable VMware appliances valuable internal targets."

Everyone must upgrade their QNAP devices immediately to be safe from future ransomware campaigns,\" Ellzey added.Besides updating your NAS device ASAP, you should also consider not exposing it online to ensure it's not reachable via the Internet for remote exploitation.Update February 03, 17:33 EST: QNAP updated their advisory today to say that \"QTS 5.0.0, QTS 4.x.x, QuTS hero 5.0.0 and QuTS hero 4.5.x are not affected.\"As a result, Censys also revised its report and now says that the number of NAS devices vulnerable to CVE-2022-27596 exploits is likely much smaller.\"With this new wording, the exposure is less extreme.

To date, the fraudsters have successfully stolen millions of dollars, according to a DomainTools research note.In the end, there are two types of victims in this fraud campaign, says Sean McNee, CTO of DomainTools.\"Obviously the first are the consumers who are tricked into investing their money — often in the millions — then losing it through cryptocurrency and other investment scams,\" he says. \"The second are the financial advisers, whose professional identities are being brazenly impersonated, putting their reputations and credibility at stake, not only today but for future business relationships as well.\"DomainTools also verified that the fraudsters seemingly understood the often-impenetrable subject of personal finance.DomainTools called the investment scam a variant of \"pig butchering\" — the latest term for a romance scam that essentially \"fattens up\" a victim by creating trust through a relationship, which then ends in financial fraud — the \"butchering\" part. The fraudsters used the identities of several hundred financial advisers, deploying a fake website on a custom domains for each identity and using known social media networks to communicate with victims, DomainTools stated.\"While many of these instances start through establishing a relationship — whether romantic, or just friendly — this is the first time we’ve seen such an extensive campaign to build trust with — fake — professional financial advisers,\" McNee says. \"Through our research, we were able to ascertain that the threat actors impersonating the financial advisers showed quite a surprisingly high level of financial expertise, and so were convincing to their victims.\"The details used to impersonate financial advisers appear to have been scraped from regulatory filings posted to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) BrokerCheck and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Investment Adviser Public Disclosure sites.\"These scams rely on slowly building trust with a target — often under the guise of a financial advisor or successful investor — in order to convince targets to invest in a scam, such as a cryptocurrency 'investment,' in which their funds are promptly stolen and rendered nearly impossible to recover,\" DomainTools stated in its research note.The campaign is not just reliant on knowledgeable fraudsters for its success. The scam is also supported by a bulletproof hosting service known as SpeedHost247, DomainTools stated. Serving a wide variety of criminal enterprises, bulletproof-hosting services are a common cybercriminal service that ignores requests for takedowns, uses difficult-to-disrupt cloud architectures, and accepts cryptocurrency to obscure financial transactions.The cluster of financial fraud activities tracked by DomainTools appears to \"share orbits\" with SpeedHost247, which operates out of West Africa, the company's researchers stated. SpeedHost247 has donned the mantle of a legitimate service, showing office buildings and spaces on its website. In reality, the images are modified pictures from other companies' sites, according to DomainTools' analysis.\"Whether SpeedHost247 is an active participant in financial advisor impersonation scams remains an open question,\" DomainTools stated in the analysis, \"but their seeming willingness to accommodate dubious customers who are offering even more dubious financial services using false information, is reason for pause.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

This likely will result in entities Killnet targeted also being hit with ransomware or DDoS attacks as a means of extortion, a tactic several ransomware groups have used,” HHS warned. Swimlane’s Daniel Selig noted that the DDoS incidents took place days after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. would be sending 31 Abrams tanks to Ukrainian forces. Selig added that last week, several financial organizations, airports and government offices in Germany were targeted in a similar way after their announcement of additional military support for Ukraine. “It goes without saying that cyberattacks on hospitals and medical centers are some of the most dangerous — these attacks have the ability to knock systems offline in their entirety and keep patients from receiving the care that they require,” he said.While DDoS attacks typically do not cause major or lasting damage, they can cause service outages that span several hours or even days.Aleksandr Yampolskiy, CEO of SecurityScorecard, noted that groups like Killnet run popular channels on the Telegram app where they recruit new members and teach other hackers DDoS skills. Killnet’s channel has more than 92,000 subscribers.Groups like Killnet are able to muster so much DDoS traffic in part because they exploit vulnerable devices online. Yampolskiy said Killnet typically target routers from MikroTek that are either misconfigured or vulnerable, and the group also takes advantage of the proliferation of IoT devices across the world. Everything from internet-connected baby cameras to smart refrigerators can be a potential target.

      "text": " OpenAI has released an AI text classifier that attempts to detect whether input content was generated using artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT.\"The AI Text Classifier is a fine-tuned GPT model that predicts how likely it is that a piece of text was generated by AI from a variety of sources, such as ChatGPT,\" explains a new OpenAI blog post.OpenAI released the tool today after numerous universities and K-12 school districts banned the company's popular ChatGPT AI chatbot due to its ability to complete students' homework, such as writing book reports and essays, and even finishing programming assignments.When testing OpenAI's AI text classifier against most of our own content, it correctly determined a human wrote our articles. As educators will likely use the new AI Text Classifiers to check if students cheated on their homework assignments, OpenAI warns that it should not be used as the \"sole piece of evidence\" for determining academic dishonesty.\"In our evaluations on a 'challenge set' of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as 'likely AI-written,' while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives).\"\"Our classifier's reliability typically improves as the length of the input text increases\"The classifier's success will likely improve as time passes and is trained with further data. For now, though, it is not a reliable tool for detecting AI-generated content."

      "text": " New versions of the Prilex point-of-sale malware can block secure, NFC-enabled contactless credit card transactions, forcing consumers to insert credit cards that are then stolen by the malware.On a payment terminal, contactless transactions use NFC (Near Field Communication) chips embedded in credit cards and mobile devices to conduct close-proximity payments via credit cards, smartphones, or even smartwatches. However, using NFC chips in credit cards has made it harder for point of sale (PoS) malware to steal credit card information, causing threat actors to develop new methods to steal your payment information.Kaspersky, following the Prilex PoS malware closely, reports seeing at least three new variants in the wild, with version numbers 06.03.8070, 06.03.8072, and 06.03.8080, first released in November 2022.These new variants introduce a new feature that prevents payment terminals from accepting contactless transactions, forcing customers to insert their cards.When the new Prilex feature is enabled, it will block contactless transactions and display a \"Contactless error, insert your card\" error on the payment terminal.This forces the victim to finish the transaction by inserting a credit card, making capturing the card information through the payment terminal easier.The malware uses a rule-based file to determine if it should block a transaction based on whether it has detected the use of NFC.Prilex's operators block NFC transactions because those generate a unique ID or card number that's only valid for a single transaction, so if that data is stolen, it wouldn't be helpful for the crooks.After the credit card data is captured, the Prilex operators employ the techniques seen in previous releases, like cryptogram manipulation and \"GHOST transaction\" attacks.Another interesting new feature seen for the first time on the latest Prilex variants is the ability to filter unwanted cards and only capture data from specific providers and tiers.Payees have limited means to protect themselves against PoS malware like Prilex, as there's no way to know if a payment terminal might be infected.Standard security measures include avoiding paying on terminals with visible signs of tampering, avoiding using public WiFi to access financial accounts without a VPN, or failing to validate the transaction details before and after its completion.Moreover, it is essential to regularly monitor financial statements to identify any potentially fraudulent transactions or charges that should be reported to the card issuer immediately."

As of end of 2022, Microsoft tracks >50 unique active ransomware families and >100 threat actors using ransomware in attacks.Last year was marked by the end of the Conti cybercrime operation and the rise of new ransomware-as-a-service (Raas) operations, including Royal, Play, and BlackBasta.Meanwhile, LockBit, Hive, Cuba, BlackCat, and Ragnar ransomware operators have kept breaching and trying to extort a steady stream of victims throughout 2022.However, this significant decline was not driven by fewer attacks but by their victims' refusal to pay the attackers' ransom demands.After hacking into Hive's servers, the FBI distributed more than 1,300 decryption keys to Hive victims and gained access to Hive communication records, malware file hashes, and details on 250 Hive affiliates. "

      "text": " Porsche cut its minting of a new NFT collection short after a dismal turnout and backlash from the crypto community, allowing threat actors to fill the void by creating phishing sites that steal digital assets from cryptocurrency wallets.NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are digital assets stored on a blockchain, representing proof of authenticity and ownership of an item, such as an artwork image, music, and anything that can take the form of digital media.The German automaker launched its first NFT mint last Monday, January 23, 2023, offering a digital replica of the iconic 911 car for 0.911 ETH, valued at about $1,500.However, delays in the rollout of the collection caused frustration in the community, as only about 20% of the promised 7,500 NFTs had been minted after 24 hours and three minting waves.To make matters worse, a flourishing NFT resale market was set up over at OpenSea, where it was cheaper to buy the Porsche collectibles than get the original, which devalued the assets immediately and further infuriated investors and traders.Eventually, on January 24, Porsche announced they would stop the minting process and cut the supply until they figured out how to get the NFT debut right. The actual minting process didn't stop until January 25 at 6 AM UTC-5, giving scammers plenty of chance to leverage the confusing situation.While the Porsche NFTs rose in value in the coming days, so did the scale of fraudulent activity around the mint, with threat actors launching phishing sites to impersonate an ongoing Porsche mint.However, when users connected their crypto wallets to the phishing sites, they would attempt to drain the assets and funds in the wallets.This forced Porsche to warn on January 27 about fake accounts promoting the continuation of the NFT minting process to steal people's details and assets.Today, over a week after Porsche's failed NFT launch, several scammers continue to trick people looking to obtain custom digital 911 NFTs.BleepingComputer had found a notable case of a now-suspended Twitter account with almost 11,000 followers impersonating Porsche's NFT-dedicated account.While this account linked to Porsche's real Discord channel, it also linked to a malicious site (\"porsche-nfts.com\") that's visually a clone of Porsche's genuine NFT portal at \"nft.porsche.com.\"While the actual site has a notice about the minting closure, the fake one pretends that the procedure is still underway, inviting users to link their wallets.Also, the fake Twitter account had a pinned tweet saying that the remaining Porsche NFTs are now available to claim for free while also promising the renewal of the stock for the remaining community.The fake account had disabled user comments under all posts and even re-tweets posts of the real Porsche account, which made it easy to trick people into getting a digital 911 NFT while missing signs of fraud.The scam account was shut down today, with a previous one used by the same scammer appearing also to have been suspended.However, other accounts are likely taking advantage of the Porsche Web3 snafu, so aspiring investors are advised to be extra vigilant."

A worker could be left unpaid, framed or involved in a fraudulent scheme.\"The highest volume of ads was posted during Q1 2020, which coincides with the massive changes brought upon the workforce by the COVID-19 pandemic. A second spike was recorded between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022.As part of the hiring process, cybercriminal recruiters conduct test assignments created to determine an applicant's level of competency in the claimed field.In some cases, the recruiters also look into the provided CV or portfolio, and in one out of four postings, there's an interview session conducted with the job seeker.In characteristic examples spotted by Kaspersky, one job posting promised to pay candidates roughly $300 in BTC for a test assignment. Another job offer laid out a multi-step screening process where the candidate would be asked to encrypt a test DLL in 24 hours, making it fully undetectable by AVs (max of 3 minor AV runtime detects).As cybercrime enterprises adopt business-like operations, we will continue to see the dark web as a recruiting tool for threat actors looking for a stable income.Some software developers may see these opportunities as a lifeline during difficult times of political unrest, poor economies, or a lack of job opportunities in their region.However, it is vital to understand the potential risks of working for a dark web employer, ranging from being scammed to getting framed, arrested, prosecuted, and imprisoned."

There are currently no indications of direct effects on the respective service and, according to the BSI's assessment, these are not to be expected if the usual protective measures are taken,\" the BSI said in a statement.Some financial sector targets had also been affected, the statement added.Killnet is a self-proclaimed Russian \"hacktivist\" group that has actively targeted opponents of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In June, the group claimed responsibility for a DDoS attack against the Lithuanian government after the Baltic country blocked the flow of goods to the Russian region of Kaliningrad.U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant previously reported that Killnet is associated with another Russian hacktivist group, Xaknet, which claims it breached numerous Ukrainian organisations.Xaknet is likely connected to Russian intelligence services, Mandiant said.Western officials say the Russian government is a global leader in hacking and uses cyber-espionage against foreign governments and industries to seek a competitive advantage. However, Moscow has consistently denied that it carries out hacking operations.\"We are not aware of what (Killnet) is.

At the time of writing, all three remain available on Google Play.The antivirus firm says the apps do not allow withdrawals before users have accumulated a significant amount of rewards. Even then, they promise to unlock \"earnings\" after users sit and watch a dozen advertisement videos.Even after watching a round of ads, the apps push even more ads allegedly to \"speed up\" the withdrawal process. In addition to these signs, Dr. Web reports that an earlier version of 'Lucky Step – Walking Tracker' offered the option to convert in-app rewards to gift cards that users could use for purchasing goods in actual online stores.In recent versions of the app, however, this functionality has been removed from the options, so it's not clear what the rewards can be converted to anymore.Some users on Google Play left reviews stating that 'Lucky Step - Waling Tracker' acts as adware, loading full-screen ads upon screen unlock, even overriding active windows.Another example of a similar app that's still available on Google Play is 'Wonder Time,' a rewards app that has amassed 500,000 downloads.The app promises to reward real money for completing various tasks like installing additional applications and games.However, the tokens users receive for each action are minuscule compared to the minimum earnings withdrawal threshold set by the developer.In the same report, Dr. Web warned that phishing apps disguised as investment apps and games were found on Google Play, measuring over 450,000 downloads.The apps connect to a remote server upon launch and receive a configuration instructing them on what to do. Typically, the instructions involve loading phishing pages that request users to enter sensitive details.The malicious game apps observed by Dr. Web are the following:If you have any of the above phishing apps installed on your Android device, you should uninstall them immediately and then run an AV scan to locate and remove any remnants.BleepingComputer has contacted Google to ask about the safety of the applications that are still on the Play Store, and we will update this post as soon as we receive a response."

      "text": " According to DOJ, FBI gained deep access to the Hive ransomware group in the late July 2022. The infiltration prevented them from blackmailing $130 million in emancipate bills from more than 300 organizations. The files of victims are encrypted by ransomware gangs using malicious software, locking them up and rendering them unavailable unless a ransom is paid to obtain a decryption key. It is being estimated that Hive and its affiliates have accumulated over $100 from more than 1,500 victims that included hospitals, school districts, financial companies and critical infrastructure, in more than 80 countries across the globe. The FBI revealed that it has collaborated with the local law enforcement agencies to help victims recover from the attack, including the UK's National Crime Agency, which claims to have given around 50 UK organizations decryptor keys to overcome the breaches. On Thursday, the US announced that it had put an end to the operation by disabling Hive's websites and communication systems with the aid of police forces in Germany and Netherlands. Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that \"Last night, the Justice Department dismantled an international ransomware network responsible for extorting and attempting to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world.\" While the Equity Division had not yet been used to capture any individual connected to Hive attacks, a senior official suggested that such releases might happen soon. In regards to the infiltrations, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O Monaco said, \"simply put, using lawful means, we hacked the hackers.\" Moreover, the DOJ says it would pursue those behind the Hive until they were brought to justice. \"A good covert operation can degrade confidence in operational security and inject suspicion among actors,” Mandiant Threat Intelligence head John Hultquist said. \"Until the group is arrested, they will never truly be gone. They will have to reconstitute, which takes time, but I'll bet they reappear in time.\"    your nameYour Emailyour message"

      "text": " The Russian cyber-espionage group known as Gamaredon may have been behind a phishing attack on Latvia's Ministry of Defense last week, the ministry told The Record on Friday.Hackers sent malicious emails to several employees of the ministry, pretending to be Ukrainian government officials. The attempted cyberattack was unsuccessful, the ministry added. The sample of the malicious email was first shared on Twitter by French cybersecurity company Sekoia.io this week. The company obtained it from VirusTotal, a Google-owned service that analyzes suspicious files, where one of the targeted users may have downloaded it to verify its sender, according to Sekoia threat intelligence researcher Felix Aime.A spokesperson for Latvia's Ministry of Defense confirmed that the latest attack was “most likely\" linked to Gamaredon, although the investigation is still ongoing. According to the Latvian computer emergency response team, CERT-LV, the attack was “unusual” because the Russian hackers communicated with researchers in the final stages of the attack when they learned they were being investigated. A CERT-LV spokesperson told The Record that hackers sent a meme depicting a Russian bear holding a paw on Ukraine, while the U.S. and EU try to contain it.Hacker groups tied to the Russian government, including Gamaredon, have targeted Latvian organizations for several years, but their activity rapidly increased since the start of the war in Ukraine. Latvia has supported Ukraine since the beginning of the war, providing weapons, humanitarian aid and shelter for Ukrainian refugees.Other Ukrainian allies, especially former Soviet Union members including Estonia and Lithuania, are also reporting an increase in cyberattacks.Ukraine’s CERT told The Record that Gamaredon is responsible for the largest number of cyberattacks on Ukraine. “Not a week went by that we didn't detect some new mass phishing email campaign with Gamaredon malware,” a CERT-UA spokesperson said.In 2022, Ukraine registered more than 70 incidents related to this group, according to CERT-UA.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

(Credit: Stock Photo, Getty Images)Every day, cyber criminals target government organizations and hospitals, from phishing emails aimed at employees to the more sophisticated cyberattacks targeting networks, critical infrastructure, sensitive mission and patient data, as well as life-saving operational systems in the clinical environment.The threat landscape constantly evolves as adversaries have now shifted their focus on data extortion, while nation-state adversaries take aim at vulnerabilities in the software supply chain with devastating consequences for the public and healthcare sectors.Over the past year, the public and healthcare sectors have focused on how to adapt, persevere and stay a step ahead of cyberattacks in an increasingly ominous threat landscape. But adversaries are relentless and certainly will continue to refine their tradecraft. In 2023, security teams in the public and healthcare sectors will need to stay ahead of identity-based attacks, ransomware-based data extortion attacks, all while navigating macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. 2023 public and healthcare sector cybersecurity trendsAdditionally, the healthcare industry must comply with various regulatory requirements, amplifying the fact that data extortion methods are potentially devastating. With every successful data breach, adversaries have the power to extort millions of dollars from healthcare facilities merely with the threat of leaking or selling sensitive data, such as patient health information (PHI). As a result of this increase in data theft and extortion in healthcare, there will be explosive growth of new criminal marketplaces dedicated to advertising and selling victims’ data to the highest bidders.Cyberattacks will continue to rise in 2023 as cybercriminals and adversaries ramp-up identity-based and ransomware attacks to take advantage of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Public and healthcare sector security teams must adopt a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that includes visibility and proactive protection across identities, IT infrastructures, and cloud workloads.James Yeager, vice president, public sector and healthcare, CrowdStrikeDigital transformation is changing the face of industrial operations and presents opportunities for organizations to revolutionize their businesses. Despite the benefits for OT, digital connectivity also brings great risk to operations.Recent mass cyberattacks that exploited vulnerabilities in software such as MOVEit, Log4j and SolarWinds Orion have served as prime examples of why companies must extend their zero-trust policies to third-party users, devices and infrastructure.

      "title": "2 federal agencies hacked in campaign using remote monitoring software | SC Media",
      "text": "  If exploited by a threat actor, legitimate RMM software can be used as a backdoor for both command-and-control or persistence on a victim’s network.The FCEB compromise was uncovered by Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in October, during a third-party retrospective analysis of EINSTEIN, a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB)-wide intrusion detection system operated and monitored by CISA that found suspected malicious activity on two FCEB networks.The first instance was deployed in mid-June, where threat actors sent a phishing email that included a phone number to an FCEB employee’s government email address. The employee then “called the number, which led them to visit the malicious domain, myhelpcare[.]online.” In September, CISA uncovered bi-directional traffic between an FCEB network and myhelpcare[.]cc. A deeper EINSTEIN analysis and incident response support found “related activity on many other FCEB networks.”The FECB intrusion led to the discovery that the cybercriminals behind the campaign had been sending help desk-themed phishing emails to both the personal and government email addresses of FCEB federal employees.The current, widespread campaign uses phishing emails to trick users into downloading legitimate RMM software, according to the joint CISA, National Security Agency, and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) alert.They aim to “exploit trust relationships in MSP networks and gain access to a large number of the victim MSP's customers,” the alert added. “MSP compromises can introduce significant risk — such as ransomware and cyber espionage — to the MSP’s customers.”The malicious emails contain either a link to “first-stage” malicious domains or prompt recipients to call the actors, who then attempt to trick recipients into visiting the first-stage malicious domain. When the victim visits the nefarious domain, an executable is triggered for download and connects to a “second-stage” malicious domain, then downloads additional RMM software.In the activity discovered by CISA, the actors were using a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts through ScreenConnect, or ConnectWise Control, and AnyDesk.What’s more, the threat actors don’t install downloaded RMM clients on the compromised host. Instead, they install “AnyDesk and ScreenConnect as self-contained, portable executables configured to connect to the actor’s RMM server.” These portable executables do not require users’ context or administrator privileges for installation.Notably, “using portable executables of RMM software provides a way for actors to establish local user access without the need for administrative privilege and full software installation — effectively bypassing common software controls and risk management assumptions.”As such, unapproved software can be executed “even if a risk management control may be in place to audit or block the same software’s installation on the network,” the alert warns. “Actors can leverage a portable executable with local user rights to attack other vulnerable machines within the local intranet or establish long term persistent access as a local user service.”The campaign is financially motivated and could lead to further malicious activity, such as the sale of victims’ account access to other cybercriminal or advanced persistent threat actors.CISA has even detected some phishing attacks’ first-stage malicious domain links periodically redirecting users to other sites for further redirects and downloads of RMM software. Once a user has downloaded the RMM software, the actors use the software to launch a refund scam that initiates a connection to the victim’s system and manipulates the user to log into their bank account while connected to the system.The threat actors’ RMM access can allow them to modify the user’s bank account summary to appear as if they were “mistakenly refunded an excess amount of money. The actors then instructed the recipient to “refund” this excess amount to the scam operator.”Silent Push’s Threat Intelligence Team uncovered the typosquatting activity in October when searching for PayPal typosquatting domains. The researchers found an entire threat “network masquerading as numerous global brand names and infecting machines with a malicious file disguised as a remote monitoring tool - WinDesk.Client.exe.”The large trojan operation mimics Amazon, Microsoft, Geek Squad, McAfee, Norton, and Paypal domains.All organizations are strongly encouraged to review the provided indicators of compromise and recommended mitigations to protect against the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. The alert contains observed first-stage domain naming patterns and other tactics used by these threat actors.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Ukraine had experienced a less than a day-long power outage in October 2022 following an attack by Russian state-sponsored hacking operation Sandworm targeted at an electrical substation amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, marking the first cyberattack-related power interruption in the country since 2017, CyberScoop reports.Attacks deployed by Iranian state-backed threat operation MuddyWater against Israel saw the utilization of the new MuddyC2Go command-and-control framework, which replaced the PhonyC2 custom platform following the exposure of its source code, reports The Hacker News.Israel had its technology, logistics, and transportation industries targeted by Iranian advanced persistent threat operation Charming Kitten, also known as APT35 and Imperial Kitten, last month amid its ongoing war with Palestinian militant group Hamas, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.On-Demand EventOn-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "3 Ways ChatGPT Will Change Infosec in 2023",
      "text": " ChatGPT took the world by storm after OpenAI opened it for testing on Nov. 30, 2022. For an industry calloused by years of largely unsatisfying AI and machine learning \"innovations,\" the reactions have been quite telling. Like many who are excited by its potential, I believe this is finally the moment of clarity for how truly revolutionary AI can be for information security.This is the problem that the array of ISACs across industries have been trying to solve — with mixed results. Going forward, an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) could take an iteration of the ChatGPT model with its natural language interface and feed it log data submitted by ISAC constituents, based on implicit trust within the group. The ISAC could then use ChatGPT to correlate network connections, categories of malicious IP addresses and domains, and similar behaviors. The results could produce a set of IDS rules that the ISAC constituents should implement to protect themselves from threats. The ISAC also would gain insight into the overall risk posture of the industry it represents.The uncertain economy is putting pressure on security organizations to implement hiring freezes to squeeze more productivity out of existing resources. ChatGPT can be extremely beneficial here as a force multiplier that enables one analyst to do the job of multiple people.Today, adversaries generate 100 million new malware samples per year. Because they all require manual coding, it is still a finite, manageable amount for signature detection. With ChatGPT, however, a hacker can say, \"Here's what I'm trying to do, and here's the OS I'm trying to do it on,\" and it can generate hundreds of thousands of iterations of one piece of malware.This will mean that the detection engines' ML models must be recomputed faster. It's far more complicated, because they're working against a much larger data set. Fortunately, ChatGPT will supercharge the reverse-engineering process and give anti-malware efforts a fighting chance.For instance, a significant reverse engineering challenge is working with a generic file name, which doesn't provide necessary context about where it was found. This requires much more manual work to identify the system for which it was built. There are minor changes in binary assembly that have marked changes on the end result — e.g., was it written for a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture? Is the system using Little Endian or Big Endian? The answers determine the direction in which you read the machine language (forward or backward).All these efforts require trial and error if you have no context. ChatGPT can run through these iterations at blazing speed and give reverse engineers the final assembly language and process it from there. They can take it further and have ChatGPT tell them what it thinks the application is doing — in natural language. More importantly, ChatGPT could do all of this at scale, analyzing hundreds of thousands of binary samples and proving insights to an analyst.It also can help fight back against common cat-and-mouse techniques. For example, malware often contains anti-reverse engineering techniques, such as nested loops, to make it much harder for reverse engineers to keep track of what is happening and the end state. ChatGPT can figure that out much faster than humans. It also can analyze the genetic code of the malware and see where there may be code reuse to identify the fingerprint of the author more quickly.Whenever new advances in AI come to fore, there is the inevitable concern about whether it will replace humans and their jobs. I don't believe ChatGPT will make this happen, but it will make us more powerful consumers of information. The force multiplier effect will be profound at all levels. I can see CISOs feeding it a set of information about its risk register for it to return policies and procedures, incident response plans, and more — all tailored to their environments.While ChatGPT is only a research preview, I share the excitement of my industry colleagues about its promise to revolutionize how security practitioners work.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Peterson“Too many bad actors believe they can illegally access proprietary information and personal financial information by hiding behind a keyboard,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown. “FBI Seattle Cyber Task Force and our experienced cyber unit is working diligently to identify, arrest, and prosecute those who seek to victimize people, businesses, and industries in the Western District of Washington and around the world.”According to the indictment, Raoult was a participant in a hacking group that dubbed itself the “ShinyHunters.”  The conspirators allegedly hacked into protected computers of corporate entities for the theft of proprietary and corporate information.  The group advertised sensitive stolen data for sale and sometimes threatened to leak or sell stolen sensitive files if the victim did not pay a ransom.  Since early 2020, ShinyHunters Group has marketed and promoted data stolen from more than 60 companies in Washington State and elsewhere around the world.According to the indictment, the conspirators created websites that appeared to be login pages belonging to legitimate businesses.  The conspirators allegedly sent phishing emails to company employees that were designed to look like they came from legitimate businesses and contained links to those login pages.  When victims provided their account sign-on credentials on those login pages, the conspirators obtained the victims’ credentials.  Using the stolen credentials, the conspirators allegedly accessed protected computers with companies’ data. The ShinyHunters maintained accounts on various dark web sites where they advertised stolen data for sale, including customer databases with personal and financial information.  The conspirators also used social media accounts to direct potential buyers to the dark web marketplaces to purchase stolen data.  Sometimes the conspirators alerted the media to their hacking or posted images on a victim website claiming credit for hacking the company. Some of the victims of the ShinyHunters hacking were located in the Western District of Washington but others were located around the world.  The victims range from tech companies, to an international stock trading company, to an apparel company, and a nutrition and fitness company.  Millions of customer records were included in the stolen data.In addition to the conspiracy counts, the wire fraud counts correspond to particular malicious emails to entities in the State of Washington and other transmissions involving the State of Washington.  The three identity theft counts are for the use of other people’s log-in credentials to access victim company data.In addition to Raoult, the indictment charges 23-year-old Gabriel Kimiaie-Asadi Bildstein aka “Kuroi” and “Gnostic Players,” of Tarbes, France, and 22-year-old Abdel-Hakim El Ahmadi aka “Zac” and “Jordan Keso” of Lyon, France.The conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse charge is punishable by a maximum of ten years in prison.  The conspiracy to commit wire fraud count is punishable by a maximum of 27 years in prison.  Wire fraud is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison.  Aggravated identity theft is punishable by a mandatory minimum two-year prison term to follow any other prison sentence imposed in the case.The charges contained in the indictment are only allegations.  A person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.The case is being investigated by the FBI Seattle Cyber Task Force.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Miriam Hinman.  DOJ’s Office of International Affairs is providing substantial assistance.  The Department of Justice also appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by Moroccan and French authorities.Tacoma – A Sumner, Washington man who has lived under a false identity for more than 25 years was arrested on a federal criminal complaint for Aggravated Identity Theft, falsely...Seattle – A federally convicted Ponzi schemer was arrested today in South Florida following an hours-long stand-off with FBI Miami, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M.

After completing the data destruction job, the malware reboots the systems, ESET researchers say.According to the researchers, Sandworm developed SwiftSlicer in Golang programming language, which has been adopted by multiple threat actors for its versatility, and it can be compiled for all platforms and hardware.The agency’s investigation revealed that SandWorm distributed the malware to computers on the network using a Group Policy Object (GPO) - a set of rules administrators use to configure operating systems, apps, and user settings in an Active Directory environment, the same method also used to execute SwiftSlicer."

We also received court authorization to wrest control of Hive’s dark net sites and render its services unavailable,” said Garland in a press conference.  Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the FBI has been inside Hive's network for months, stealing decryption keys to pass onto victims so they would not have to pay to decrypt their files.“Simply put: using lawful means, we hacked the hackers. We turned the tables on Hive and we busted their business model, saving potential victims approximately $130 million in ransomware payments,” said Monaco.Based on the search warrant executed Jan. 11, the servers were leased using three email addresses that law enforcement had identified as being used by Hive operators.According to testimony from FBI special agent Timothy Callinan, the FBI has had access to Hive’s network since at least July 2022. One of the two U.S.-based servers seized was a redundant backup server hosting Hive’s Tor-based leak sites and victim negotiation portal. The other was a backend server connecting to Hive’s broader network and infrastructure and also contained records of communication between different Hive members, malware hashes as well as information on at least 250 Hive affiliates.The FBI was able to obtain decryption keys for specific intrusions and said it passed 1,000 keys to at least 336 victims, helping save them as much as $130 million in ransom payments.   FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau has since shared decryptor keys with victims in the U.S. as well as \"many victims overseas.\" He used the seizure as an opportunity to urge additional businesses to come forward and provide assistance to the FBI, touting the bureau's efforts to help past victims avoid payments or get their money back and noting that many Hive victims do not report when they are hit with a ransomware attack.\"So today's lesson for businesses large and small, for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this: reach out to your local FBI field office today, introduce yourself so that you know who to call when you become a victim of a cyber attack.\"As part of that advisory, the agencies asked victims to come forward and submit a range of evidence to authorities that may help the FBI investigate, including malware samples, images of infected systems, malicious IP addresses, a copy of their ransom note, ransom amounts, and Bitcoin wallet information.“From June 2021 through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH),” the agencies advised late last year.However, RaaS groups like Hive are massive, decentralized operations with many different affiliates, operators and developers. John Hultquist, Head of Mandiant Threat Intelligence at Google Cloud, said he was skeptical that the operation would cripple Hive's operations but it might dissuade them and similar groups from pursuing higher-value targets.\"The disruption of the Hive service won’t cause a serious drop in overall ransomware activity but it is a blow to a dangerous group that has endangered lives by attacking the healthcare system,\" said Hultquist in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the criminal marketplace at the heart of the ransomware problem ensures a Hive competitor will be standing by to offer a similar service in their absence, but they may think twice before allowing their ransomware to be used to target hospitals.\"Austin Berglas, a former FBI cyber official who helped create and lead the cyber branch at the bureau's New York office, largely concurred with that assessment, saying that takedowns can lead to brief disruptions of ransomware activity but only temporarily, while noting that authorities did not mention any arrests of individuals linked to the group.\"True dismantlement comes only when law enforcement can 'put hands on' or arrest the individuals responsible. However, identifying the actual human beings behind the keyboard is a very difficult task,\" said Berglas, now global head of professional services at BlueVoyant. \"Many of these cyber criminals are adept at anonymizing their online communications, locations, and infrastructure - often operating in global locations where international law enforcement cooperation is non-existent and utilizing bullet-proof hosting providers, which are unresponsive to legal process.\"This is a developing story and SC Media will continue to update as new information becomes available.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": " Lexmark has released a security firmware update to fix a severe vulnerability that could enable remote code execution (RCE) on more than 100 printer models.The security issue is tracked as CVE-2023-23560 and, according to the company, it has a severity rating of 9.0. It is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the Web Services feature of Lexmark devices.The vendor’s advisory says that the bug could be leveraged to gain arbitrary code execution on the device, which could have a wider impact in an organization.In the context of a printing service, an SSRF vulnerability could give attackers to access print jobs, let them obtain the credentials to the network the printer is connected to, and potentially pivot to other devices on the same segment.CVE-2023-23560 impacts a large number of Lexmark printers, so owners of Lexmark devices are recommended to check the advisory and confirm they’re running a safe firmware version released on or after January 18, 2022.In general, all firmware versions numbered 081.233 and below are vulnerable regardless of their letter coding, while fixed versions are numbered 0.81.234 and later.To determine what firmware runs on your device, navigate to “Settings → Reports → Menu Setting Page” and check the version listed under the “Device Information” section.To obtain a copy of the latest firmware version for your printer model, visit Lexmark’s official download portal.For those who cannot apply the security update, Lexmark suggests the workaround of disabling the Web Services feature on TCP port 65002, blocking the ability for attackers to exploit CVE-2023-23560.To do that, head to “Settings → Network/Ports → TCP/IP → TCP/IP Port Access,” uncheck “TCP 65002 (WSD Print Service),” and save the changes.Printer devices are often neglected when it comes to applying good security practices, and they are left exposed to risks for extensive periods.Users should take appropriate measures like applying security updates in a timely fashion, using strong administrator credentials, and disabling unused web-facing services."

During the incident, an attacker gained access to one of eight file servers and accessed both patient and employee health information. The exposed data varied by individual and including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, contact information, and email addresses.The lawsuit took aim at Logan Health’s previous security incident and lawsuit settlement, noting that the health system already “claimed to be taking ‘further steps to revise procedures that will minimize the risk of a similar event happening again.’”The breach victims further alleged that the 2021 incident was directly caused by the provider failing to adhere to representations expressed in the past breach notice. In particular, Logan Health was accused of failing to reasonably train employees and/or implement procedures or protocols that would have prevented the second security incident.“Particularly because Logan Health has demonstrated an inability to prevent a breach or stop it from continuing even after being detected, [individuals] have an undeniable interest in ensuring that their PII/PHI is secure, remains secure, and is not subject to further theft,” according to the lawsuit.As such, the filing asserted that the one-year of identity theft protection offered by the provider was “grossly inadequate.”The purported harm outlined in the lawsuit included references outlining the cost of medical identity theft recovery, which averages up to $19,000 and over 200 hours to resolve the issue. The suit did not, however, detail whether the breach victims had actually experienced these worst-case scenarios as a direct result of the 2021 breach.The proposed settlement appears to take these issues into account and requires Logan Health to share details into the actions it has already taken or its plans to strengthen the cybersecurity training and awareness programs, data policies, security measures, and data restrictions, as well as its monitoring and response capabilities.Individuals affected by the 2021 incident can also file claims to be reimbursed for up to $25,000 in out-of-pocket expenses directly tied to the breach and up to $125 for documented instances of time lost responding to the incident. The settlement also includes alternate cash payments and free credit monitoring for affected individuals.Logan Health also agreed to pay “attorneys’ fees not to exceed one-third” of the settlement and “reimbursement of litigation costs and expenses not to exceed $150,000,” according to the settlement proposal.The proposal is subject to final approval, which is scheduled for March 9.Logan Health joins an increasingly long list of provider organizations to be hit with a patient-led lawsuit after a reported security incident.

Dubbed SwiftSlicer, the Slovakian cybersecurity firm ESET discovered the attack levied used Active Directory Group Policy and was written in Go programming language.Once deployed, SwiftSlicer deletes shadow companies and recursively overwrites files located in system drivers and other non-system drives before rebooting the computer. ESET researchers explained on Twitter that the wiper overwrites drives using 4096 bytes-length blocks filled with randomly generated bytes. But long before the Ukraine invasion, the Russian state-sponsored threat group known as Sandworm wreaked havoc across a range of sectors. Sandworm was tied to the notorious NotPetya cyberattacks deployed in 2017 that targeted the health sector and the Ukraine power grid attacks launched in 2015 and 2016.Since early 2022, the group has actively targeted a range of Ukrainian organizations. The last detection was in November, where ESET research connected the novel .NET-based RansomBoggs ransomware variant to the group, given the use of similar tactics and dissemination.The November campaign leveraged a PowerShell script to distribute the ransomware in a nearly identical process to the Industroyer2 malware attacks deployed in April 2022. The POWERGAP PowerShell script levied in the attacks enabled the delivery of CaddyWiper malware via the ArguePatch loader.The Sandworm operation has also been linked to the Russia-backed Iridium, which likely executed a Prestige ransomware attack that targeted transportation and logistics organizations in both Ukraine and Poland.

This incident also impacted Azure Government cloud services that were dependent on Azure public cloud.\"We've confirmed that the impacted services have recovered and remain stable. We're investigating some potential impact to the Exchange Online Service. Further, updates on the Exchange investigation will be available in your admin center under the SI# EX502694.Microsoft now also revealed that the issue was triggered when changing the IP address of a WAN router using a command that had not been thoroughly vetted and that has different behaviors on different network devices.\"As part of a planned change to update the IP address on a WAN router, a command given to the router caused it to send messages to all other routers in the WAN, which resulted in all of them recomputing their adjacency and forwarding tables,\" Microsoft said.\"During this re-computation process, the routers were unable to correctly forward packets traversing them.\"While the network began recovering on its own starting at 08:10 UTC, the automated systems responsible for maintaining the health of the wide area network (WAN) paused due to the impact on the network. These systems included those for identifying and eliminating unhealthy devices as well as traffic engineering systems for optimizing data flow across the network. As a result of the pause, some network paths continued experiencing increased packet loss from 9:35 UTC until the systems were manually restarted, returning the WAN to optimal operating conditions and completing the recovery process at 12:43 UTC.Following this incident, Microsoft says that it's now blocking highly impactful commands from being executed and that it will also require all command execution to follow guidelines for safe configuration changes."

      "text": "  St. Margaret’s Health has temporarily suspended operations at its hospital in Peru, Illinois, as its leadership could not “find nor financially support” a new provider for its emergency room department.The Spring Valley branch was struck by a cyberattack on Feb 22, 2021, prompting the launch of electronic health record downtime procedures and a complete enterprise network shutdown that lasted for several weeks. All web-based operating systems, such as email and the patient portal, were also brought offline.Patient care continued without interruption, due to its previously implemented and practiced downtime procedures. However, the hospital was forced to divert its diagnostic imaging procedures to another hospital branch to ensure accuracy of scans. According to the letter sent to employees, these outages contributed to the hospital’s ongoing financial constraints. The letter cites a number of factors, including the cyberattack that led to the hospital being unable to “bill nor get paid, in a timely manner, for the services provided during the outage. The hospital was also facing staffing shortages that required the use of “temporary agencies to fill positions at a significantly higher pay rate.”“And, like you, we have been faced with rising costs for goods,” the health system CEO and board chair wrote. “This all came at great financial cost. It’s obvious to the Board and Administration that action is needed now.” Further, “the current provider of physicians terminated their contract effective at that time.” The hospital has also struggled to “attract enough staff to continue to operate both hospitals.” As a result of these compounding factors, the hospital will no longer have ER physician coverage at its SMH-Peru branch beginning on Jan. 28 as hospitals aren’t legally allowed to operate without a fully staffed emergency room.The letter notes that hospital leadership will continue its ongoing efforts to convert the Peru branch to a Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) by working with local legislators to “expedite adoption of the REH regulations that were just issued by Centers for Medicare Services (CMS).”Although temporary, the situation is a worst-case scenario stakeholders have long suspected could occur when constrained budgets meet the staggering recovery costs and lost revenue brought on in the wake of a cyberattack.Several estimates based on health systems that provided financial details after an incident detail just how much a cyberattack with related-outages cost provider organizations. For example, the outages at Universal Health Services and Vermont Health lasted about one month, and cost $67 million and $63 million ,respectively.While St. Margaret Health’s hospital closure appears temporary, it should serve as another warning to provider organizations to practice remediation plans and ensure business continuity plans include processes for maintaining critical services in the event of a cyber-related outage.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

      "text": " Security researchers have analyzed a variant of the PlugX malware that can hide malicious files on removable USB devices and then infect the Windows hosts they connect to.The malware uses what researchers call \"a novel technique\" that allows it to remain undetected for longer periods and could potentially spread to air-gapped systems.Looking for similar samples, Unit 42 also discovered a PlugX variant on Virus Total that locates sensitive documents on the compromised system and copies them to a hidden folder on the USB drive.In the recent attacks that Unit 42 observed, the threat actor is using the 32-bit version of a Windows debugging tool named ‘x64dbg.exe’ along with a poisoned version of ‘x32bridge.dll,’ which loads the PlugX payload (x32bridge.dat).At the time of writing, most antivirus engines on the Virus Total scanning platform don't flag the file as malicious, the detection rate being of just 9 out of 61 products.The researchers explain that the PlugX version they encountered uses a Unicode character to create a new directory in detected USB drives, which makes them invisible on Windows Explorer and the command shell. These directories are visible on Linux but concealed on Windows systems.“To achieve code execution of the malware from the hidden directory, a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file is created on the root folder of the USB device,” Unit 42 says.The malware creates a ‘desktop.ini’ file on the hidden directory to specify the LNK file icon on the root folder, making it appear as a USB drive to trick the victim. Meanwhile, a ‘RECYCLER.BIN’ subdirectory acts as a disguise, hosting copies of the malware on the USB device.The victim clicks on the shortcut file on the root folder of the USB device, which executes x32.exe via cmd.exe, resulting in the infection of the host with the PlugX malware.Simultaneously, a new Explorer window will open to show the user’s files on the USB device, making everything appear normal.After PlugX gets on the device, it continually monitors for new USB devices and attempts to infect them on discovery.During their research, the Unit 42 team has also discovered a document-stealing variant of the PlugX malware that targets USB drives, too, but has the added capability of copying PDF and Microsoft Word documents onto a folder in the hidden directory called da520e5.It is unknown how the threat actors retrieve these “locally exfiltrated” files from the USB drive, but physical access might be one of the ways.While PlugX was typically associated with state-backed threat actors, the malware can be purchased on underground markets and cybercriminals have also used it.With the new development that makes it more difficult to detect and allows it to spread through removable drives, Unit 42 researchers say that PlugX has the potential to jump to air-gapped networks."

This takes the form of malicious links that can lead to credential theft and onward compromise, including data exfiltration.To maintain the ruse, the adversarial crews are said to have created bogus profiles on social media platforms to impersonate field experts and journalists to trick victims into opening the links.The stolen credentials are then used to log in to targets' email accounts and access sensitive information, in addition to setting up mail-forwarding rules to maintain continued visibility into victim correspondence.APT42, which operates as the espionage arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), is said to share overlaps with PHOSPHORUS and is part of a larger group tracked as Charming Kitten.Furthermore, a notable aspect of these campaigns is the use of targets' personal email addresses, likely as a means to circumvent security controls put in place on corporate networks.\"These campaigns by threat actors based in Russia and Iran continue to ruthlessly pursue their targets in an attempt to steal online credentials and compromise potentially sensitive systems,\" Paul Chichester, NCSC director of operations, said.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

At best, their lures made reference to specific brand names in the industry, sometimes promising salary increases or job opportunities, but the efforts here were mainly rudimentary.Where other cybercrime groups may focus on perfecting social lures and delivery mechanisms, researchers explained that malware creation is where TA444 really distinguishes itself.\"This suggests that there is an embedded, or at least a devoted, malware development element alongside TA444 operators,\" according to the report.\"While we may poke fun at its broad campaigns and ease of clustering,\" the researchers warned, \"TA444 is an astute and capable adversary.\"Proofpoint's report noted that monitoring for MSHTA, VBS, Powershell, and other scripting-language execution from new processes or files can help detect TA444 activity. It also recommended using best practices for a defense-in-depth approach to combat TA444 intrusions: Using network security monitoring tools, using robust logging practices, a good endpoint solution, and an email monitoring appliance, in addition to training the workforce to be aware of heist activity that stems from contact on WhatsApp or LinkedIn. \"Additionally, given the credential phishing campaign activity we observed, enabling MFA authentication on all externally accessible service would help limit the impact of credentials eventually getting stolen,\" the researchers said via email.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Two separate but similar espionage campaigns from Russian and Iranian-linked groups have prompted a warning from Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre.In a document published on Thursday local time the NCSC warned how instead of sending surprise phishing emails, the hacking groups – identified as \"Russia-based\" SEABORGIUM and \"Iran-based\" APT42, or Charming Kitten – are contacting their targets in a benign fashion and attempting to build a rapport and a sense of trust.Only after this has been established do the groups attempt to dupe their victims into visiting a website which looks like the real sign-in page of a legitimate service, such as Gmail or Office 365, but is actually designed to harvest the target’s log-in credentials.Individuals working in “academia, defence, government organisations, NGOs, think-tanks, as well as politicians, journalists and activists,” are being targeted by the two groups. The attackers use “open-source resources to conduct reconnaissance, including social media and professional networking platforms” before reaching out.“Having taken the time to research their targets’ interests and contacts to create a believable approach,” the hackers start to build a rapport with their targets, often beginning “by establishing benign contact on a topic they hope will engage their targets,” NCSC said.“Once trust is established, the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and shares a link, apparently to a document or website of interest. This leads the target to an actor-controlled server, prompting the target to enter account credentials.”After these credentials are compromised, the groups “then use the stolen credentials to log in to targets’ email accounts, from where they are known to access and steal emails and attachments from the victim’s inbox. They have also set-up mail-forwarding rules, giving them ongoing visibility of victim correspondence.”Although many cybersecurity researchers have labeled the entities as nation-state hacking groups, the NCSC has not formally attributed the campaigns to the governments of Iran and Russia. Typically the United Kingdom regards attribution to a state as a political declaration normally reserved for the Foreign Office.Charming Kitten has been described as state-sponsored by numerous specialist companies — including Google, Recorded Future and Proofpoint — on the basis of its apparent intelligence-gathering rather than financial motivation.After investigating the infrastructure being used to support the campaign, HRW discovered 44 phishing pages crafted to look like Microsoft, Google or Yahoo! login pages, displaying the email addresses of the targets who were human rights activists, journalists, diplomats and politicians working in the Middle East and North Africa.CERTFA’s founder, Amin Sabeti, told The Record he knew of at least two cases of people in the U.K.being targeted by the Charming Kitten campaign. He explained how the espionage can pose various risks to these individuals, including even exposing their network of contacts inside Iran.“If the individual works with them, the network will end up in prison in Iran or [the government will] use the material against the target to discredit them. For example, we have seen leaks of emails from prominent activists that the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] has been trying to discredit in the public's eye,” explained Sabeti.It is not known what links, if any, these threats share with the Charming Kitten espionage campaign, but Sabeti told The Record he believed that Charming Kitten was linked to the IRGC and that he wouldn't be surprised to read a news story announcing that one of the campaign's targets had been killed.\"For example, imagine if the IRGC can convince someone to go to a country where the IRGC can run ops easily, such as Armenia, by impersonating someone and then inviting the target for a face-to-face meeting, workshops, speech, educational opportunity, etc,\" he said.The group “primarily targets NATO countries, particularly the US and the UK” said researchers from Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), and has a “high interest in targeting individuals” rather than corporations. Almost a third of the alerts which the company has sent out to potential victims were to people with consumer Microsoft email accounts.It is not clear what interaction if any Dearlove had with the group before it accessed his ProtonMail account, however Microsoft’s article on the group has revealed it has — similarly to Charming Kitten — created fake profiles on LinkedIn “for conducting reconnaissance of employees from specific organizations of interest.”“While the malicious campaigns use similar techniques and have similar targets, the campaigns are separate and the two actors are not collaborating,” the NCSC’s advisory stated.In a statement published alongside the advisory, the NCSC's director of operations, Paul Chichester, said: “The UK is committed to exposing malicious cyber activity alongside our industry partners and this advisory raises awareness of the persistent threat posed by spear-phishing attacks.“These campaigns by threat actors based in Russia and Iran continue to ruthlessly pursue their targets in an attempt to steal online credentials and compromise potentially sensitive systems. We strongly encourage organisations and individuals to remain vigilant to potential approaches and follow the mitigation advice in the advisory to protect themselves online.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Hackers are auctioning the alleged source code of the popular multiplayer online arena video game “League of Legends” stolen from the American gaming giant Riot Games in a cyberattack last week.Cyberattack On Riot GamesAdditionally, the source code for League of Legends (LoL), Teamfight Tactics (TFT), and its “legacy” anti-cheat platform were also exfiltrated by the threat actor.“The illegally obtained source code also includes a number of experimental features. While we hope some of these game modes and other changes eventually make it out to players, most of this content is in prototype and there’s no guarantee it will ever be released,” the company announced in a series of tweets.While the exact nature of the hack is unknown, Riot Games said that no player data or player personal information has been compromised. It added that the cyberattack would slow down the release of upcoming patches for some of its games.Ransom DemandThe threat actor this Tuesday has reportedly sent a ransom email to Riot Games and demanded a payment of $10 million in order to prevent the stolen data from going online.Below is an excerpt from the ransom email sent to Riot Games:“Dear Riot Games, We have obtained your valuable data, including the precious anti-cheat source code and the entire game code for League of Legends and its tools, as well as Packman, your usermode anti cheat. We understand the significance of these artifacts and the impact their release to the public would have on your major titles, Valorant and League of Legends. In light of this, we are making a small request for an exchange of $10,000,000.”As evidence, the hacker also sent two PDF documents that contains the stolen Packman and League of Legends source code.Once the ransom payment is received, the hackers claimed that they will erase the code from their servers and the files will never be released to the public. They will also “provide insight into how the breach occurred and offer advice on preventing future breaches.”Further, the ransom note added that, “We do not wish to harm your reputation or cause public disturbance. Our sole motivation is financial gain.”The initial email also provided a deadline of 12 hours to respond, noting that a failure to do so would result in “the hack being made public and the extent of the breach being known to more individuals.”Responding to the ransom note, Riot Games said that it won’t pay the ransom amount demanded by the attackers.“Today, we received a ransom email. Needless to say, we won’t pay,” Riot Games’ official Twitter account announced.Today, we received a ransom email. Needless to say, we won’t pay.While this attack disrupted our build environment and could cause issues in the future, most importantly we remain confident that no player data or player personal information was compromised.2/7 Stolen Source Code Put Up For Auction Following the disclosure of the cyberattack by Riot Games, a threat actor who goes by the name “Arka” or “ArkaT” posted an ad on a popular criminal forum, Breached, selling the stolen source code of the League of Legends for a minimum of $1 million, which also includes Packman and user mode anti-cheat for League of Legends and Valorant.“League of Legends Source Code Auction! As you know, League of Legends source code has been stolen, confirmed by Riot Games. I’m starting auction for the source code, at starting $1,000,000. ** INCLUDES PACKMAN (USERMODE ANTI-CHEAT FOR LEAGUE OF LEGENDS & VALORANT) **.”The post includes a large PDF that contains a directory listing of the 72.4 GB stolen source code.According to the hacker, cheat makers for League of Legends could end up paying huge amounts for the source code for games and an anti-cheat system, as a threat actor can create cheats or exploits for these games.“This is very valuable for cheat developers, it’s a huge game, I’m sure it would be at every advantage for a cheat developer,” Arka wrote in the forum thread.Indeed, Riot Games too believes that if the source code is leaked, it could result in the spread of new cheats for League of Legends.“Truthfully, any exposure of source code can increase the likelihood of new cheats emerging. Since the attack, we’ve been working to assess its impact on anticheat and to be prepared to deploy fixes as quickly as possible if needed,” the company said in a tweet on Tuesday.“We’ve made a lot of progress since last week and we believe we’ll have things repaired later in the week, which will allow us to remain on our regular patch cadence going forward. The League and TFT teams will update you soon on what this means for each game.”"

      "text": " Security researchers discovered a new ransomware strain they named Mimic that leverages the APIs of the 'Everything' file search tool for Windows to look for files targeted for encryption.Mimic ransomware attacks begin with the victim receiving an executable, presumably via email, which extracts four files on the target system, including the main payload, ancillary files, and tools to disable Windows Defender.Mimic is a versatile ransomware strain that supports command line arguments to narrow file targeting, while it can also make use of multiple processor threads to speed up the data encryption process.The new ransomware family features several capabilities seen in modern strains, such as:Killing processes and services aim to disable protection measures and free up important data like database files, making them available for encryption.Mimic ransomware uses Everything’s search capabilities in the form of the ‘Everything32.dll’ dropped during the infection stage to query for specific file names and extensions oin the compromised system.Everything helps Mimic locate files that are valid for encryption while avoiding system files that would render the system unbootable if locked.Files encrypted by Mimic get the “.QUIETPLACE” extension. A ransom note is also dropped, informing of the attacker's demands and how the data can be recovered after by paying a ransom in Bitcoin.Mimic is a new strain with unproven activity as of yet, but using of the Conti builder and the Everything API proves its authors are competent software developers who have a clear understanding of how they can achieve their goals."

      "text": " The vulnerability was actually patched in August 2022, but its existence only revealed two months later, likely to avoid alerting attackers before the security updates are widely implemented.“The attack flow is twofold. The first phase requires taking a legitimate certificate, modifying it, and serving the modified version to the victim. The second phase involves creating a new certificate whose MD5 collides with the modified legitimate certificate, and using the new certificate to spoof the identity of the original certificate’s subject.”To exploit CVE-2022-34689, the first certificate, which is generated in a way that facilitates a chosen prefix collision attack and is correctly signed and verified, needs to be cached by the CryptoAPI, so that the second certificate (with the same MD5 thumbprint as the previous one) can be promptly trusted because Microsoft does not re-check cached certificates.“The [CryptoAPI caching] mechanism is disabled by default. To enable it, the application developer needs to pass certain parameters to CertGetCertificateChain, the Windows API function that eventually leads to the vulnerable code,” the researchers explained.They found some apps that use the CryptoAPI in such a way – old versions of Chrome (v48 and earlier) and Chromium-based applications – and they believe there are others. Luckily, there are two prerequisites for a successful exploitation of CVE-2022-34689: the machine must run Windows and not have the patch released by Microsoft, and must run an app that uses the CryptoAPI caching mechanism. The researchers advise admins to apply the latest security patch released by Microsoft on Windows servers and endpoints, and developers to switch to using other WinAPIs to check the validity of a certificate before using it. Unsupported but still used Windows versions should get a patch, too, they noted, but I doubt that Microsoft will release them given the current limited exploitation scope."

      "text": "  The Trellix research team said they have patched nearly 62,000 open-source projects that were susceptible to a 15-year-old path traversal vulnerability in the Python programming ecosystem.(Image credit: matejmo via Getty Images)The Trellix research team said they have patched nearly 62,000 open-source projects that were susceptible to a 15-year-old path traversal vulnerability in the Python programming ecosystem. “Though it takes time and requires collaboration, our mass and automated patching effort tells the industry that this can be done,” said Kasimir Schulz, vulnerability researcher at Trellix Advanced Research Center.Schulz said one of the biggest challenges around using an automated approach has been balancing the need to patch as many projects as possible without lowering the quality of the patch. To avoid spamming projects that weren’t actually vulnerable, the team focused the code scanning tool on the most commonly occurring formats of the vulnerability.Specifically, the team’s patching process can be broken into two steps: the patching phase and the pull request phase, both of which are automated.The team then moved to the pull request phase, first reviewing a list of local patch diffs, then creating a fork of the repository on GitHub. After cloning the fork, they replaced the original file with the patched file if the original file had not changed.“We then committed the changes to the repository and created a pull request from our forked repository back to the original repository along with a message detailing who we were and why we were doing the pull request. At this point, it was now up to the owner of the repository to accept or reject our changes,” the blog post explained.While Trellix’s success can serve as a model to the broader open source community, security researchers say massive, automated patching comes with its own set of challenges and security risks.“I think the automated patching approach taken by Trellix researchers is extremely helpful, yet I’m afraid it can only be practiced in specific situations, such as the one described in the blog post in which the conditions for the vulnerability to be applicable are very well defined,” said Yotam Perkal, director of vulnerability research at Rezilion.One risk is that automated patching at scale can function more as a broadsword than a scalpel, one that may be less effective depending on the specific IT environment.“It would be ideal if a researcher could define a CodeQL query that pinpoints a specific vulnerable code pattern without generating too much noise [or] false detections,” said Perkal. However, he noted that creating such a query isn’t straightforward, as often, multiple logical conditions have to be in place for a vulnerable code pattern to be exploitable.Testing is another challenge with mass patching. Often, instead of just patching something and hoping it doesn’t cause harm, researchers test the software following a patch to ensure nothing is broken and the update actually mitigates the real problem, said Tim Mackey, head of software supply chain risk strategy at Synopsys. “If appropriate testing safeguards are in place, mass patching offers significant promise to alleviate legacy vulnerabilities,” Mackey said. “If anyone thinks this can be accomplished by a simple string replacement of ‘bad version’ with ‘good version’, without investing in testing the results of the effort, they’re likely to create more harm than good.”Menghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media, covering software supply chain security, workforce/business, and threat intelligence.

      "text": "  U.S. and international law enforcement authorities have taken action against the Hive ransomware group, including the seizure of U.S.-based servers and the shutdown of at least two of the group's dark net sites.On Thursday morning, two of the group’s sites on the dark web used to communicate with and extort victims and leak data for non-paying businesses were replaced with a notice indicating in both English and Russian that the site has been seized in an international law enforcement operation involving the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, Secret Service, Germany, Europol and other European countries.“The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized this site as part of a coordinated law enforcement action against Hive ransomware,” the notice reads. Garland said the bureau’s investigation led them to discover two backend computer servers in Los Angeles used by the group to store data.“Last night, pursuant to a court order, we seized those servers. We also received court authorization to wrest control of Hive’s dark net sites and render its services unavailable,” said Garland in a press conference.  Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the FBI has been inside Hive's network for months, stealing decryption keys to pass onto victims so they would not have to pay to decrypt their files.“Simply put: using lawful means, we hacked the hackers. We turned the tables on Hive and we busted their business model, saving potential victims approximately $130 million in ransomware payments,” said Monaco.Based on the search warrant executed Jan. 11, the servers were leased using three email addresses that law enforcement had identified as being used by Hive operators.According to testimony from FBI special agent Timothy Callinan, the FBI has had access to Hive’s network since at least July 2022. One of the two U.S.-based servers seized was a redundant backup server hosting Hive’s Tor-based leak sites and victim negotiation portal. The other was a backend server connecting to Hive’s broader network and infrastructure and also contained records of communication between different Hive members, malware hashes as well as information on at least 250 Hive affiliates.The FBI was able to obtain decryption keys for specific intrusions and said it passed 1,000 keys to at least 336 victims, helping save them as much as $130 million in ransom payments.   FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau has since shared decryptor keys with victims in the U.S. as well as \"many victims overseas.\" He used the seizure as an opportunity to urge additional businesses to come forward and provide assistance to the FBI, touting the bureau's efforts to help past victims avoid payments or get their money back and noting that many Hive victims do not report when they are hit with a ransomware attack.\"So today's lesson for businesses large and small, for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this: reach out to your local FBI field office today, introduce yourself so that you know who to call when you become a victim of a cyber attack.\"As part of that advisory, the agencies asked victims to come forward and submit a range of evidence to authorities that may help the FBI investigate, including malware samples, images of infected systems, malicious IP addresses, a copy of their ransom note, ransom amounts, and Bitcoin wallet information.“From June 2021 through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications, Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH),” the agencies advised late last year.However, RaaS groups like Hive are massive, decentralized operations with many different affiliates, operators and developers. John Hultquist, Head of Mandiant Threat Intelligence at Google Cloud, said he was skeptical that the operation would cripple Hive's operations but it might dissuade them and similar groups from pursuing higher-value targets.\"The disruption of the Hive service won’t cause a serious drop in overall ransomware activity but it is a blow to a dangerous group that has endangered lives by attacking the healthcare system,\" said Hultquist in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the criminal marketplace at the heart of the ransomware problem ensures a Hive competitor will be standing by to offer a similar service in their absence, but they may think twice before allowing their ransomware to be used to target hospitals.\"Austin Berglas, a former FBI cyber official who helped create and lead the cyber branch at the bureau's New York office, largely concurred with that assessment, saying that takedowns can lead to brief disruptions of ransomware activity but only temporarily, while noting that authorities did not mention any arrests of individuals linked to the group.\"True dismantlement comes only when law enforcement can 'put hands on' or arrest the individuals responsible. However, identifying the actual human beings behind the keyboard is a very difficult task,\" said Berglas, now global head of professional services at BlueVoyant. \"Many of these cyber criminals are adept at anonymizing their online communications, locations, and infrastructure - often operating in global locations where international law enforcement cooperation is non-existent and utilizing bullet-proof hosting providers, which are unresponsive to legal process.\"This is a developing story and SC Media will continue to update as new information becomes available.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": " When the incident was disclosed, Riot Games said that multiple systems in its development environment had been compromised and said the incident had affected its ability to release new content.In a series of tweets updating gamers, the company said that source code for its popular titles League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics had been exfiltrated during the attack.It warned that the attack “disrupted our build environment and could cause issues in the future” but stressed “most importantly we remain confident that no player data or player personal information was compromised.”Alongside the source code for its popular games the company said that the attackers stole information relating to “a legacy anticheat platform.”“Truthfully, any exposure of source code can increase the likelihood of new cheats emerging. Since the attack, we’ve been working to assess its impact on anticheat and to be prepared to deploy fixes as quickly as possible if needed,” the company announced.Riot said the “illegally obtained” code contained “a number of experimental features” which might never have made it into the official games.“While we hope some of these game modes and other changes eventually make it out to players, most of this content is in prototype and there’s no guarantee it will ever be released,” the company said.Both its internal security teams and a “globally recognised external consultant” are evaluating the attack and auditing Riot’s systems, the company said, adding that it had notified law enforcement and was “in active cooperation with them as they investigate the attack and the group behind it.”“We’re committed to transparency and will release a full report in the future detailing the attackers’ techniques, the areas where Riot’s security controls failed, and the steps we’re taking to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” the company added.The suspected hacker in that incident shared images, videos and source code on a fan forum as evidence that they had accessed the “GTA 5 and 6 source code and assets, GTA 6 testing build.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": "  An unidentified group is using remote access tool SparkRAT, as well as other legitimate and malicious tools created by Chinese-speaking developers, to target internet-connected servers in East Asia, according to new research from Sentinel One.Senior threat research Aleksandar Milenkoski told SC Media the campaign, which his team calls “DragonSpark,” is a cluster of activity that has not been connected to any previously known state or financially motivated hacking group thus far. It appears to focus on the use of SparkRAT, which researchers described as “a feature-rich and multi-platform tool” that can be used on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.“When we combine all this, [SparkRAT] is a very feature-rich and multi-platform tool that they can re-use in different victim environments. We came to the conclusion that they probably adopted it because it’s very, very practical for them,” Milenkoski said. The findings bolster evidence that the previously little-known open source tool is becoming more widely used by malicious hackers. In December, Microsoft claimed that threat actors were increasingly relying on SparkRAT, but it’s not clear if the actors behind DragonSpark were included in that assessment.However, the company is not tying the activity to Beijing or any known state-sponsored APT, and Milenkoski told SC Media that the evidence they’ve collected thus far does not provide any clear indicators whether the ultimate goal behind the intrusions is financial, espionage-related or both.While such evidence can often indicate the regional or language preferences of a particular threat actor, it is not unheard of for one hacking group to use the preferred tools of another as a way of masking their identity, so researchers are being cautious when it comes to drawing too strong of a conclusion around attribution.   “We were very careful with that, we use the term ‘Chinese-speaking intentionally due to many reasons,” Milenkoski said.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

The botnet can perform DDoS attacks on HTTP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, VSE and OpenVPN protocols and supports a variety of flooding methods.Unit 42 logged activity leveraging CVE-2021-35394 from all over the world but almost half of the attacks originated from the United States.However, using VPNs and proxies may obscure the actual source, as threat actors prefer using U.S.-based IP addresses to evade blocklists.“From August 2021 to December 2022, we have observed 134 million exploit attempts in total, targeting CVE-2021-35394, with 97% of these attacks occurring after the start of August 2022,” reads Unit 42’s report.Realtek chipsets are omnipresent in the IoT world, and even when the Taiwanese chip maker pushes security updates to address problems in its products quickly, supply chain complexities delay their delivery to end users.Also, users often neglect firmware updates even when those become available from their device vendors, and many treat IoT devices with the “set and forget” mindset.A surge in exploiting CVE-2021-35394 almost more than a year after Realtek released security fixes indicates that remediation efforts are lagging and the blame for this is shared between vendors and the end user.Some of the vulnerable devices may no longer be supported. In some cases, vendors may have released an update with a fix but users failed to install it. Users should check if their devices are impacted and if there are available security patches that address CVE-2021-35394.If your device has already been infected, the recommendation is it to perform a factory reset, set a strong administrator password, and then apply all the available firmware updates.Exploiting CVE-2021-35394 is expected to stay at high levels in the first half of 2023 due to the complexities in supply chain patching that cause massive delays in managing the security problem."

      "text": " A massive ad fraud operation dubbed 'Vastflux' that spoofed more than 1,700 applications from 120 publishers, mostly for iOS, has been disrupted by security researchers at cybersecurity company HUMAN.The operation's name was derived from the VAST ad-serving template and the \"fast flux\" evasion technique used to conceal malicious code by rapidly changing a large number of IP addresses and DNS records associated with a single domain.According to HUMAN's report, Vastflux generated over 12 billion bid requests per day at its peak and impacted almost 11 million devices, many in Apple's iOS ecosystem.The research team at HUMAN (Satori) discovered Vastflux while investigating a separate ad fraud scheme. They noticed noticed that an app was generating an unusually large number of requests using different app IDs.By reverse engineering the obfuscated JavaScript that operated in the app, the Satori team discovered the command and control (C2) server IP address it was communicating with and the ad-generating commands it sent.Vastflux generated bids for displaying in-app ad banners. If it won, it placed a static banner image and injected obfuscated JavaScript into it.The injected scripts contacted the C2 server to receive an encrypted configuration payload, which included instructions on the position, size, and type of ads to be displayed, as well as data for spoofing real app and publisher IDs.Vastflux stacked up to 25 video ads on top of one another, all generating ad view revenue, but none of them was visible to the user as they were rendered behind the active window.To evade detection, Vastflux omitted the use of ad verification tags, which allows marketers to generate performance metrics. By avoiding these, the scheme was made invisible to most third-party ad-performance trackers.Having mapped the infrastructure for the Vasstflux operation, HUMAN launched three waves of targeted action between June and July 2022, involving customers, partners, and the spoofed brands, each delivering a blow to the fraudulent activity.Eventually, Vastflux took its C2 servers offline for a while and scaled down its operations, and on December 6, 2022, the ad bids went down to zero for the first time.While ad fraud does not have a malicious impact for the app users, it causes performance drops for the device, increases the use of battery and internet data, and can even lead to device overheating.The above are common signs of adware infections or ad fraud in the device, and users should treat them with suspicion and try to pinpoint the app(s) that account for most of the resource consumption.Video ads consume much more power than static ads, and multiple hidden video players aren't easy to hide from performance monitors, so it's crucial to always keep an eye on running processes and look for signs of trouble."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is becoming a crucial component of cybersecurity for organizations and individual users. The weakness of password-only authentication methods are increasingly recognized, with compromised login credentials the most common method used by cyber-criminals to breach organizations.Kevin Dunn, senior vice president, head of professional services at NCC Group, told Infosecurity: “As with many things, as defenses increase, attackers adapt to overcome. MFA bypass is becoming a common theme in attack chains to overcome initial authentication barriers and compromise a system or identity perimeter.”It is clear that cyber-threat actors have developed multiple techniques for bypassing MFA systems. Matt Cooke, director, cybersecurity strategy, EMEA at Proofpoint, noted that MFA phishing kits are being observed for sale on cybercrime websites, with many of these able to be purchased “for less than a cup of coffee.”These tools are often adapting similar approaches found in “traditional kits” that steal only usernames and passwords. They are often installed on a dedicated server owned by the threat actor or covertly installed on a compromised server owned by an unlucky individual.These kits typically target human weaknesses to steal tokens. “Attackers often rely on notification fatigue, bombarding an employee with approval requests until they finally relent,” said Cooke.The use of social engineering tactics to steal MFA codes are also commonly observed by Dunn. This includes push notification attacks, whereby an attacker attempts to convince a user to hit ‘yes’ to a push notification access request through social engineering, or what he terms ‘push notification fatigue.’“This is where a user is so overwhelmed by either the frequency of requests or the hectic nature of their day-to-day lives that they simply hit yes without thinking. While this might seem unlikely, it happens a lot,” he explained.In addition, Cooke said he had observed an increase tools that use a transparent reverse proxy to present the actual website to the victim. This enables so-called man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks – essentially the deployment of a proxy server between a target user and an impersonated website, allowing threat actors to capture the usernames, passwords and session cookie in real time.Jason Steer, CISO at Recorded Future, also highlighted the growing prevalence of infostealer malware to bypass MFA.“These malware families, once installed on a victim's computer, look for credentials in browsers and for hard coded authentication tokens that store the zero trust information inside a file. Essentially the ownership of the file allows the new 'owner' to log into Slack, Teams and other business critical systems without any additional authentication requirement,” he explained.A less common and particularly sophisticated technique sometimes used is the targeting of the cryptographic components behind the MFA process itself, allowing attackers to create a backdoor or mint their own authentication tokens.“This is a rather sophisticated attack and requires a previous method of compromise, but it did rear its head during the SolarWinds incident,” commented Dunn.Sometimes, cyber-criminals find MFA bypass opportunities presented to them, by exploiting flaws and mistakes within organizations’ systems. Therefore, it is increasingly important that security teams are consistently checking for vulnerabilities in their MFA systems that can potentially lead to a bypass.After entering his username and password, Hill was prompted to provide an MFA, of which (ISC)2 offers several options. As he wasn’t able to access his choice of Google authenticator code, he clicked the option to ‘try another method.’One of these methods was an SMS code, and this allowed Hill to register any phone number to enable SMS authentication method during the login flow. This code was sent to his phone and allowed him to access his account.Therefore, he essentially bypassed his own MFA – although this can only occur if the users’ password and username were already compromised and SMS wasn’t already set up as their MFA method. Hill revealed that he reported the issue to (ISC)2 on October 25, 2022, and three days later the certification body confirmed it had understood the report.On December 13, 2022 (ISC)2 informed Hill that the problem had been resolved, but the exact date of the fix has not been confirmed.Speaking to Infosecurity, (ISC)2’s CEO Clar Rosso, said that the organization’s security team had shut the issue down by the end of October. Thankfully, “in the work we’ve done since there’s no evidence of any kind of compromise that happened as a result.”In his blog detailing his findings, Hill suggested the flaw may have been caused by an SSO upgrade that (ISC)2 made on its website on 27 July 2022. Rosso confirmed to Infosecurity that the issue arose from a human implementation error, which provided learning opportunities for the body. “That allowed us to look at our security processes to see how we can avoid these kinds of problems on the front end in the first place,” she said.Rosso added that this analysis needs to continue on an ongoing basis and that (ISC)2 welcomes input from external security researchers.In terms of advice for other organizations based on this recent experience, Rosso said security teams should always be aware of the wider impact and collateral damage a mistake can have on their IT system. “You need to test and retest your business processes to ensure they’re working in the way they’re supposed to,” she noted.There are a number of steps that organizations should be taking to reduce the risk of MFA bypass. One of which is constantly testing their systems, as mentioned by Rosso.Dunn advised: “For the riskiest users (but ideally for everyone), FIDO U2F is the gold standard. Several sites and applications now support it, such as Okta, Duo, Google Workspace, AWS and Microsoft 365. Despite this, I see very few companies making the switch.”Recorded Future’s Steer concurred, stating: “Look for alternate stronger MFA options such as Yubikey and other FIDO compliant tools to strengthen secondary MFA channels.”Finally, close monitoring and auditing of authentication events remain crucial to enable a rapid response when malicious actors have compromised a user’s password and MFA, which can never be completely infallible.“By understanding how the attacks work and how they manifest in terms of indicators of activity or indicators of compromise, an organization can setup a monitoring strategy that has a good chance of spotting suspicious activities before they become problems,” said Dunn.The experts Infosecurity spoke to emphasized that MFA remains vital in spite of the growing risk and should be employed in every possible circumstance.“We as an organization take the posture that MFA is good practice – the same as government agencies across the world. If MFA is available to you, you should employ it,” commented Rosso.However, it is not infallible, and should be considered one aspect of a more rounded security strategy.Proofpoint’s Cooke said: “The days of the MFA “silver bullet” for credential phishing are gone. A majority of leading organizations implemented MFA and have largely been able to discount credential phishing for several years. Those organizations need to now assess their ability to detect account compromise, not just prevent it.”Strong MFA should therefore be developed in conjunction with effective detection technologies and processes. "

      "title": "\r\n\tDDoS activity intensifies in Asia Pacific - Infosecurity Magazine\r\n",
      "text": " CEO and co-founder of StormWallWhile record-breaking DDoS campaigns firmly occupied the headlines of DDoS-related news in 2022, there was one, lesser talked about region, that perhaps wasn’t covered enough — despite being the centerstage of DDoS activity. The Asia Pacific (APAC) region. Most organizations are unlikely to be able to fend off such attacks on their own, and judging by the attack statistics we collect from our clients, incidents are becoming increasingly common in APAC. Services on offer include DDoS protection for websites, TCP/UDP applications and networks, as well as a web application Firewall. The new location has allowed us to increase the overall StormWall network, and the website loading delays has decreased for visitors from Southeast Asia and Australia.StormWall’s servers in Singapore are located in the Equinix SG1 data center, which is equipped with internet exchange points access to one of the world's three GRX peering points.We chose this data center because it's the most network-dense facility in the region, offering ultra-low latency connectivity. Spread across multiple floors of a nine-story reinforced concrete building, the servers are secured in meticulously temperature-controlled rooms, ensuring optimal performance and energy efficiency. All of this enables StormWall to provide traffic filtering with close to zero latency.StormWall also has points of presence in the US, Germany, Kazakhstan, China and most recently — Singapore. We work with companies from all around the world, including the Bank of China, Africell, ServerRun, and more.Our products guarantee 100% mitigation of network, transport and application layer attacks, thanks to a proprietary Triple Filter system. Our solution uses AI to intelligently block junk traffic from reaching the server without losing legitimate packets. Even during powerful attacks, visitors browsing websites under StormWall protection will encounter minimal or non-existent delays.In incident response, every second matters and technical support can make or break your defense. For example, StormWall’s tech support team is on standby 24/7 and responds to tickets under 15 minutes, even at night or during holidays.All of StormWall’s points of presence have 2500 Gbit/s stateles bandwidth, and 1200 Gbit/s stateful bandwidth, enough to withstand botnet-attacks with close to zero impact on protected resources. When your system comes under a DDoS attack, our solution will automatically recognize the junk traffic, filter it, and redirect only real users to your server, saving their IPs in HTTP header. ​​As far as DDoS goes, 2022 was record-breaking. We’ve seen attacks getting more powerful, more frequent, and we’ve seen a lot of evolution in terms of what instruments threat actors have access to. Probably more so than in the last couple of years. The capacity for launching ultra-powerful DDoS attacks has increased dramatically, and with it — the requirements for effective protection.While it is true that we should brace for a difficult year, the worst that can happen is to be caught unprepared. The cost of recovering from a successful attack is magnitudes higher than the cost of DDoS protection. If we think about securing our resources in advance, we will weather whatever cybercriminals throw at us with minimal damages."

      "text": "  Threat actors abuse these features to activate or instrument their malware by using LNK files that purport as benign files of interest to their targets, say the researchers. Guilherme Venere, a threat researcher at Cisco Talos, said threat actors are usually motivated by two  objectives: they either look for financial gain or in the case of nation-state actors, obtaining information for espionage. Venere said successful infections of victims are paramount to these malicious campaigns.“Therefore, threat actors will quickly adapt and experiment with new techniques and discard old methods in favor of something new or more efficient,” explained Venere. “The takeaway from this research is that sometimes these actors forget to cover their tracks. A quick turnaround time and ever-changing techniques lead to residual indicators in malicious artifacts that can be leveraged by defenders to track and block such threats.”Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, said we’ve seen threat actors evolve rapidly in response to changes in their target’s defenses or to changes in attack surface. Parkin said Office macros had been a favorite vector, so it was no surprise attackers found something else to use in the form of LNK files. “These files link to various ‘objects’ and are often used as shortcuts, but can contain quite a bit of additional information,” Parkin said. “By carefully crafting these LNK files, threat actors can get them to bypass some of the safeguards in place and have them execute download and execute malicious code, among other things. The attackers quick change of approach from macros to LNK files points out that we are dealing with adversaries who can be quite creative in finding new ways to abuse existing functionality.\"“In these examples, the executable is a PowerShell script that then downloads and executes a malicious binary from a remote, adversary-controlled host,” Neray said. “To protect against this type of adversary playbook, organizations should use endpoint controls to restrict access to LNK files and prevent suspicious execution of PowerShell code, along with email security to scan attachments for malicious files, and network monitoring to prevent access to suspicious hosts.”Jerrod Piker, competitive intelligence analyst at Deep Instinct, said attackers are using many methods to trick users into launching LNK files that point to malware, such as Emotet and Trickbot, among other nasty families.“Phishing emails and malicious URLs have been used in recent months by threat actors to this end,” Piker said. “Because LNK files can include command parameters in their launch properties or point to scripting applications such as PowerShell, a user may not even be aware of what’s happening when they interact with a LNK file.”Malicious Python packages spread BlazeStealer malware Eight new Python packages masquerading as obfuscation tools have been used to facilitate the distribution of the BlazeStealer malware since January, The Hacker News reports.Hackread reports that Microsoft Azure's Automation Service has been leveraged to create the first cryptocurrency miner that could not be detected by security systems.Indian government organizations had their Windows and Linux systems subjected to two new attack campaigns by Pakistan-linked advanced persistent threat operation SideCopy, one of which involved the exploitation of a WinRAR security vulnerability, aimed at facilitating the deployment of various remote access trojans, The Hacker News reports.   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "text": " Two vulnerabilities in the Galaxy App Store, Samsung’s official repository for its devices, could enable attackers to install any app in the Galaxy Store without the user’s knowledge or to direct victims to a malicious web location.The issues were discovered by researchers from the NCC Group between November 23 and December 3, 2022.The Korean smartphone maker announced on January 1, 2023 that it fixed the two flaws and released a new version for Galaxy App Store (4.5.49.8).It should be noted that both attacks require local access, an easy feat for motivated hackers and malware distributors targeting mobile devices.The first of the two flaws is tracked as CVE-2023-21433 and is an improper access control that allows attackers to install any applications available on the Galaxy App Store.NCC discovered that the Galaxy App Store does not handle incoming intents in a safe way, allowing apps on the device to send arbitrary app installation requests.The PoC shared by NCC’s analysts is an ‘ADB’ (Android Debug Bridge) command that instructs an app component to install the “Pokemon Go” game by sending an intent with the specified target application to the app store.The intent may also specify if the new application should be opened or not after its installation, which gives threat actors more choices over how to conduct the attack.The second vulnerability is CVE-2023-21434 is an improper input validation that lets attackers execute JavaScript on the target device.NCC’s researchers found that webviews in the Galaxy App Store contain a filter that limits the domains it can be shown in it. However, that filter isn’t properly configured and can be bypassed to force the webview to access malicious domains.The PoC presented in the report is a hyperlink that, if clicked from Chrome, will open a page containing malicious JavaScript and run it on the device.NCC explains that the only prerequisite for this attack is for the malicious domain to have the “player.glb.samsung-gamelauncher.com” part in it. An attacker can register any domain and add that part as a subdomain.Running arbitrary JavaScript code in webviews from within system-privilege apps like the Galaxy Store can come with severe security repercussions.Depending on the attacker’s motives, the attack may lead to app UI interaction, access to sensitive information, or crashing apps.The installation and automatic launch of apps from the Galaxy Store without the user’s knowledge may also lead to data or privacy breaches, especially if the attacker uploads a malicious app on the Galaxy Store beforehand.It is important to note that CVE-2023-21433 is not exploitable on Samsung devices running Android 13, even if they use an older and vulnerable version of the Galaxy Store. This is owed to additional security protections on the latest version of Google’s mobile OS.Unfortunately, all Samsung devices that are no longer supported by the vendor and which remain stuck to an older Galaxy Store version are vulnerable to the two vulnerabilities discovered by the NCC Group researchers."

Apparently, the same hacker group utilized Tornado Cash, a now banned crypto mixer that conceals names of people involved in the transaction, in order to carry out the attack. As per the analysis, conducted by token movements, the ETH was routed through the anonymity system Railgun before being collected in wallets and sent to three significant crypto exchanges, possibly to be exchanged for fiat currency. ZachXBT shared details of this week’s token movements on Twitter, claiming Lazarus Group has had “a very busy weekend” moving funds. In the follow-tweets, ZachXBT also linked to the website Chainabuse.com where he shared a list of approximately 350,000 unique wallet addresses that were involved in the Friday’s operation. On Monday, Binanace CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ too, commented on the situation.\nCZ claims that the hackers used Huobi, a competing exchange, rather than Binance this time as one of their exchanges. The hacker's accounts were subsequently frozen with Binance's assistance, he says. CZ also disclosed that 124 BTC ($2.6m) had been seized from the hackers, indicating at least some of their ETH has been converted to BTC. “We detected Harmony One hacker fund movement. They previously tried to launder through Binance and we froze his accounts. This time he used Huobi. We assisted Huobi team to freeze his accounts. Together, 124 BTC have been recovered,” he wrote. Although, Huobi did not comment on the matter other than retweeting an article claiming that the exchange had frozen accounts containing money connected to the hack. According to a report from South Korea's National Intelligence Service from December of last year, North Korean hackers have stolen more than $1 billion in digital assets since 2017. Moreover, the report claims that around $626 million, or more than half of that estimated tally, was taken in 2022.

Typically, decryptors help existing victims, however, the adversary notices and changes tactics quickly, so decryptors often have limited use going forward, said John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich. “That being said, victims may not be known to researchers,” said Bambenek said. “Therefore, a public decryptor can help those unknown victims recover some of their data, so it’s still a great service to perform.”Andrew Barratt, vice president at Coalfire, added that encrypting ransomware has become the scourge of blue teams everywhere. Not knowing if anyone will make a decryptor available, or if the malware uses rotating or online keys makes it very difficult to avoid having to pay the ransom, said Barratt.“While this decryptor only works on a known variant — it’s better than nothing for those impacted,” said Barratt. “It does put emphasis on the importance for good defensive planning, though, if the team depends on publicly-available research to recover business systems or data — the security plan needs more attention and the company should take a long look at the maturity of any existing programs in the organization.” Drew Schmitt, lead analyst at GuidePoint's research and intelligence team (GRIT), pointed out that BianLian was the seventh most active double extortion ransomware group in 2022, despite its operations beginning in summer 2022. Schmitt said GRIT found that BianLian claimed 76 public victims, accounting for 3% of the total ransomware victims in 2022.“Beginning in late-November through the end of 2022, the group has averaged one new public victim each day, which may be a result of maturing their processes and/or adding new members to their team,” said Schmitt. “Although BianLian has become well-known in 2022, their methods show signs of an inexperienced group including leveraging a less sophisticated leak site and utilizing chat applications such as Tox for conducting their negotiations. BianLian is also generally more aggressive in their negotiation tactics, starting most negotiations with very high ransom demands.”After admitting responsibility for compromising Sony, a Colonial Pipeline supplier, and a Hawai'i government site, the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates, reports The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.U.S. advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39,111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year, which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation, reports BleepingComputer.Attack on the U.S. subsidiary of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week.

Those details were then successfully used by a hacker to access 133 Mailchimp accounts.Mailchimp says that it contacted all affected account holders on January 12, less than 24 hours after the security breach was discovered.One of those Mailchimp customers who appear to have been affected was WooCommerce, makers of a WordPress plugin that is popular with businesses operating online stores.WooCommerce contacted affected users warning them that some of their personal information had been exposed:Such information could clearly be exploited by attackers in, for instance, phishing attacks. No doubt WooCommerce, and other Mailchimp users, are less than impressed that their own customers have been put at risk due to Mailchimp’s security slip-up.Mailchimp is no stranger to security breaches.Then, as in the most recent security breach, the attacker used social engineering to dupe Mailchimp workers into handing over their login credentials.Although Mailchimp appears to have acted relatively promptly in this instance, there must surely be questions asked as to whether it is doing enough to lock down access to its internal tools, and ensuring only those who are truly authorised are able to access them.Your email address will not be published.

      "text": " An unusual phishing technique has been observed in the wild, hiding empty SVG files inside HTML attachments pretending to be DocuSign documents.Security researchers at email security provider Avanan named it \"Blank Image.\" They explain that the attack allows phishing actors to evade detection of redirect URLs.The victim is requested to review and sign the sent document that is named \"Scanned Remittance Advice.htm.\"If a victim clicks on the “View Completed Document” button, they are taken to a genuine DocuSign webpage. However, if they attempt to open the HTML attachment, the ‘Blank Image’ attack is activated.The HTML file contains an SVG image encoded using the Base64 encoding format with an embedded JavaScript code that redirects the victim automatically to the malicious URL.The SVG image does not contain any graphics or shapes, so it renders nothing on the screen. Its role is that of merely a placeholder for the malicious script.Unlike raster images, like JPG and PNG, SVGs are vector images based on XML and can contain HTML script tags. When an HTML document displays an SVG image through an <embed> or <iframe> tag, the image is displayed and the JavaScript inside it executes.In the DocuSign-themed campaign that Avanan researcher spotted, the SVG is empty. The victim sees nothing on their screen but the URL redirect code still runs in the background.Users should treat emails with HTML code in them and .HTM attachments with caution. Avanan also suggests that administrators should consider blocking them them."

      "text": " A new Android malware named 'Hook' is being sold by cybercriminals, boasting it can remotely take over mobile devices in real-time using VNC (virtual network computing).While the author of Hook claims the new malware was written from scratch, and despite having several additional features compared to Ermac, researchers at ThreatFabric dispute these claims and report seeing extensive code overlaps between the two families.ThreatFabric explains that Hook contains most of Ermac's code base, so it's still a banking trojan. At the same time, it includes several unnecessary parts found in the older strain that indicate it re-used code in bulk.Despite its origin, Hook is an evolution of Ermac, offering an extensive set of capabilities that make it a more dangerous threat to Android users.One new feature of Hook compared to Ermac is the introduction of WebSocket communication that comes in addition to HTTP traffic used exclusively by Ermac. The network traffic is still encrypted using an AES-256-CBC hardcoded key.The highlight addition, however, is the 'VNC' module that gives threat actors the capability to interact with the user interface of the compromised device in real-time.This new system enables Hook's operators to perform any action on the device, from PII exfiltration to monetary transactions.\"This kind of operation is much harder to detect by fraud scoring engines, and is the main selling point for Android bankers.\"The catch is that Hook's VNC requires Accessibility Service access to work, which might be hard to get on devices running Android 11 or later.Hook's new (in addition to Ermac's) commands can perform the following actions:Apart from the above, a \"File Manager\" command turns the malware into a file manager, allowing the threat actors to get a list of all files stored in the device and download specific files of their choice.Another notable command that ThreatFabric found concerns WhatsApp, allowing Hook to log all messages in the popular IM app and even allowing the operators to send messages via the victim's account.Finally, a new geolocation tracking system enables Hook operators to track the victim's precise position by abusing the \"Access Fine Location\" permission.Hook's target banking applications impact users in the United States, Spain, Australia, Poland, Canada, Turkey, the UK, France, Italy, and Portugal.At this time, Hook is distributed as a Google Chrome APK under the package names \"com.lojibiwawajinu.guna,\" \"com.damariwonomiwi.docebi,\" \"com.damariwonomiwi.docebi,\" and \"com.yecomevusaso.pisifo,\" but of course, this could change at any moment.To avoid becoming infected with Android malware, you should only install apps from the Google Play Store or those provided by your employer."

(Image credit: Trifonov_Evgeniy via Getty Images)Researchers at Ermetic have found and reported a cross-site request forgery vulnerability software management tool that is used across multiple Microsoft Azure cloud services and would allow an attacker to take over and remotely execute code on a victim’s application.The bug, first discovered by researcher Liv Matan and reported to Microsoft on Oct. 26, is the result of manipulating a series of misconfigurations and security bypasses in Kudu, a back-end source control management (SCM) tool that helps manage and modify web applications and is used by major services like Azure Functions, Azure App Service and Azure Logic Apps.From there, the attacker must locate a vulnerable endpoint to deploy a malicious zip file through a browser. With one click, an attacker is able to run code and commands as the www user, steal or delete sensitive data, take over the app’s managed identity and conduct lateral movement across other Azure services and facilitate future phishing campaigns. In an interview, Matan said that he eventually keyed in on Kudu, knowing that if he cound find a way to bypass its authentication protocols, it would likely give him broad-based access and capabilities across multiple Azure products.“It seemed impossible for us to target all of those services at once, until we discovered [some] common ground between them,” said Matan. “Kudu deploys itself behind every application and every service … it triggered our researcher mindset, because if an attacker could potentially target and take over this service, it could run sensitive operations on behalf of the victim.”Igal Gofman, head of research at Ermetic, said a bad actor would need a certain amount of technical skill to find something like EmojiDeploy and it would still require a user to first click on a malicious link to exploit. However, once they have, it offers a fairly direct path to compromising web applications.“It’s not a script kiddie vulnerability, but once an advanced attacker finds the vulnerability it is very easily exploitable,” said Gofman.While Microsoft has patched the EmojiDeploy vulnerability, Ermetic researchers recommend a number of steps organizations can take to protect themselves from similar attacks. For instance, deploying least privilege access policies for back-end tools like Kudu that have broad-based privileges across multiple applications and services can help to limit the potential damage of a compromise.EmojiDeploy is the second vulnerability disclosure this week targeting major Azure services.Derek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media, where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors.

      "text": " The info-stealing malware Rhadamanthys uses Google advertisements as a means of luring people into downloading malicious software. The malware steals information including email addresses and passwords in addition to focusing on cryptocurrency wallet credentials. Rhadamanthys is sold to criminals as malware-as-a-service (MaaS), and its utility has multiplied as infostealers become a popular tactic to attack targets. As of yet, at least one prominent user on the cryptocurrency scene has fallen prey following the malware campaign. According to the victims, the hackers had stolen all their digital crypto assets, along with having access to their professional and personal accounts. According to threat researcher Germán Fernández, Rhadamanthys, named after the demigod child of Zeus and Europa in Greek mythology, has been dominating Google advertising for the widely used OBS (Open Broadcasting Tool) platform, a free video recording, and streaming service. Since November 2022, Rhadamanthys’ popularity has been growing rapidly. It has now advanced to a point where, if an online user searches for an OBS, they will eventually encounter five malicious ads at the apex of their Google searches, before seeing legitimate results below. A user may download malware, alongside legitimate software after he clicks on these advertisement links. In one such instance, 'Alex', a crypto influencer, better known by his online persona NFT God, was hacked following the download of a fraudulent executable for the OBS video recording and streaming program, through Google’s search results. His life was permanently altered when he mistakenly clicked on the fraudulently sponsored advertisement rather than the genuine one. “Last night my entire digital livelihood was violated. Every account connected to me both personally and professionally was hacked and used to hurt others. Less importantly, I lost a life changing amount of my net worth,” he tweeted. According to a report by the security firm Cyble, Rhadamanthys is offered for sale on the dark web and is distributed via spam emails along with Google advertisements. Rhadamanthys will start by obtaining relevant device data after a successful intrusion. The data often includes the device's name, model, operating system, OS architecture, hardware details, installed software, IP addresses, and user credentials “The Rhadamanthys program is capable of executing certain PowerShell commands[...]It also targets document files, the theft of which (depending on the sensitivity of their data) can cause severe issues for victims,” reads a blog post by cybersecurity firm PCrisk. In addition to this, the MaaS targets cryptocurrency wallet credentials by attempting to extract crytowallets’ passwords in order to acquire control of them and their funds. “In summary, the presence of stealer-type malware like Rhadamanthys on devices can result in serious privacy issues, significant financial losses, and even identity theft,” PCrisk concluded. In order to delay the victim’s response, users are advised to evade the malware activity by checking the URL, since the malicious links may seem identical to the official OBS site. The fraudulent URL may contain subtle spelling mistakes, a malicious tactic used to create fake URLs, called Typosquatting.   your nameYour Emailyour message"

This takes the form of a Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) archive file containing a Visual Basic Script dropper to deploy the next-stage payload.Alternatively, it's suspected that the files are distributed via social media platforms such as Facebook and Discord, in some cases even creating bogus accounts to serve ads on pages impersonating legitimate news outlets.The CAB files, hosted on cloud storage services, also masquerade as sensitive voice recordings to entice the victim into opening the archives, only for the VBScript to be executed, leading to the retrieval of another VBScript file that masks itself as an image file.The second-stage VBScript, for its part, fetches from an already breached domain a PowerShell script that's responsible for loading the RAT payload into memory and executing it.NjRAT (aka Bladabindi), first discovered in 2013, has myriad capabilities that allow the threat actor to harvest sensitive information and gain control over compromised computers.\"This case demonstrates that threat actors will leverage public cloud storage as malware file servers, combined with social engineering techniques appealing to people's sentiments such as regional geopolitical themes as lures, to infect targeted populations,\" the researchers concluded.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "text": " Senior cybersecurity officials from the United Kingdom and Ukraine met for several hours on Wednesday to discuss threat intelligence relating to Russian cyberattacks.The bilateral talks between National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) staff and a delegation from Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) and its Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) covered the latest developments in the conflict, although the substance of the meetings was not disclosed.While in London, the Ukrainian delegates also appeared at the CyberThreat conference to give a keynote speech discussing their response to attacks on the country’s critical infrastructure.Cameron said her organization, which is a part of Britain’s cyber and signals intelligence agency GCHQ, had “not been surprised by the volume of Russian offensive cyber operations, nor have we been surprised by their targeting.”However she praised the work of the SSSCIP and CERT-UA, stating: “If the Ukrainian cyber defense teaches us a wider lesson – for military theory and beyond – it is that in cybersecurity, the defender has significant agency. In many ways you can choose how vulnerable you can be to attacks.”In a statement, NCSC’s director of operations Paul Chichester said: “Ukraine has defended itself resolutely in cyberspace in the face of Russian aggression and the UK has been proud to support that defense.“It is fitting that, here in the UK, we are hosting senior figures involved in Ukraine’s response. We are honored to do so. This visit is an important moment in our relationship and an excellent opportunity to learn from each other as we continue to build our collective resilience.”Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " The Russian co-founder of a cryptocurrency exchange allegedly used to launder cybercrime proceeds was arrested early Wednesday morning in Miami, the Department of Justice announced. Legkodymov’s arrest coincided with an international operation against the exchange, including the seizure of its servers. French authorities, alongside Europol and partners in Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus, “dismantled Bitzlato’s digital infrastructure,” the DOJ announcement said.“Together, Hydra and Bitzlato formed a high-tech axis of crypto crime,” Monaco said at a press conference Wednesday. “Hydra buyers funded illicit purchases of illegal drugs, stolen financial information and hacking tools from crypto accounts hosted at Bitzlato.” According to the DOJ, between 2018 and 2022, Bitzlato facilitated $700 million in direct or indirect transfers of sales on Hydra. More than $15 million in ransomware proceeds have allegedly been laundered through the exchange. The U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also took action, labeling Bitzlato a “primary money laundering concern.” According to FinCEN, after the seizure of Hydra, the exchange continued to facilitate transactions on darknet marketplaces with Russian ties, like BlackSprut, OMG!OMG! and Mega.  “Bitzlato plays a critical role in laundering Convertible Virtual Currency (CVC) by facilitating illicit transactions for ransomware actors operating in Russia, including Conti, a Ransomware-as-a-Service group that has links to the Government of Russia,” FinCEN wrote in a statement. “The majority of ransomware incidents reported to FinCEN in the second half of 2021 were conducted by Russia-related ransomware variants, indicating that Bitzlato is part of a larger ecosystem of Russian cybercriminals that are allowed to operate with impunity in Russia.” Under the order, certain financial institutions are prohibited from transmitting funds linked to Bitzlato. According to Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Bitzlato allowed users to open accounts with “minimal identifying information.” That anonymity was key to the exchange’s operations, allegedly making it a “safe haven” for criminals. Legkodymov and other executives messaged one another about how the exchange had attracted “dirty money” and users “known to be crooks.” “To anyone who still believes that they can hide from the law by using cryptocurrency, this prosecution should put that illusion to rest,” Peace said.Legkodymov is facing a maximum of five years in prison on the money transmitting charges, but could face other charges at a later date.James Reddick has worked as a journalist around the world, including in Lebanon and in Cambodia, where he was Deputy Managing Editor of The Phnom Penh Post. He is also a radio and podcast producer for outlets like Snap Judgment.© Copyright 2023 | The Record from Recorded Future News"

The DDoS group presumably used this money to purchase more firepower for launching disruptive attacks.On Friday, January 13, 2023, Kraken announced they had taken over Solaris' infrastructure, GitLab repository, and all project sources, thanks to \"several huge bugs in the code.\"Kraken's statement claims that it took them three days to steal the clear text passwords and keys stored in Solaris' servers, access its infrastructure located in Finland, and then download everything without anyone stopping them.Finally, the attackers said they disabled Solaris' Bitcoin server, which aligns with Elliptic's observations in the blockchain.\"The project has several huge bugs in the code, which to this day remain relevant, you can turn over and over again. Also, storing passwords and keys from your servers in clear text is an even bigger mistake, the lot of schoolchildren from the 5th desk,\" claims a note on the Kraken marketplace seen by Elliptic.\"This event took us 3 days in a calm mode and we downloaded absolutely EVERYTHING that is supposed to be in such cases (and no one stopped us). PS We deliberately disabled the bitcoin server so that no one steals anything, but probably in vain).\"\"Everything that is written above is a response to aggression in our direction in the amount of x10, we warned. The same applies to others.\"At this time, neither Killnet nor anyone from the Solaris core team has issued any announcement about the platform's status and the validity of Kraken's claims.Kraken is also pro-Kremlin, so the motives of the hack are unlikely to be political. Instead, they appear to be fueled by market interests, as taking over a competitor and redirecting their members to your platform is undoubtedly an effective way to achieve growth while also planting concern about the security of the breached market."

      "text": " Deputy Editor, Infosecurity MagazineDNV, a Norwegian software supplier that provides services for 12,000 ships and mobile offshore units across the globe, said its ShipManager software had been hit by the attack on January 7, 2023.Consequently, around 70 customers operating roughly 1000 vessels have been impacted. These customers “have been advised to consider relevant mitigating measures depending on the types of data they have uploaded to the system.”DNV added that it had informed the impacted parties about their responsibility to notify the relevant data protection authorities in their countries of the incident.However, the firm said “there are no indications that any other data or servers by DNV are affected,” and the server outage has not impacted any of its other services.Additionally, the incident has not affected the vessels’ ability to operate. This is because they can still use the onboard, offline functionalities of the ShipManager software. Also, other systems on the impacted ships remain unaffected.DMV has reported the attack to the Norwegian Police, which is liaising with other relevant government agencies, including the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (Datatilsynet) and the German Cyber Security Authority (BSI).The software supplier revealed it is also working with IT security partners to investigate how the incident occurred and “ensure secure online operations as soon as possible.”Many ships also contain aging technological infrastructure, making them particularly vulnerable to vectors like ransomware.Commenting on the DMV incident, Dr Darren Williams, CEO and founder of Blackfog, highlighted the growing targeting of critical infrastructure organizations: “Although the strain of ransomware used in this attack is still yet to be officially declared, the first major concern that comes to mind in relation to the attack at Maritime DNV is it adds yet another critical infrastructure victim to the list.“With a global war at play and the DNV holding a global market share of 21% of the solutions and services of any maritime vessel, suppliers such as the DNV are ideal victims for attackers due to the large-scale disruption they can potentially cause.”Simon Chassar, CRO at Claroty, believes the increasing interconnectedness of physical and digital systems in sectors like shipping is making incidents of this nature harder to mitigate. “Unfortunately, attacks that impact the critical infrastructure industry are increasing as they add more digital transformation and connected cyber-physical systems to their networks without the right protection tools,” he outlined.Chassar added: “The convergence of IT and OT systems, as well as the connection of industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices and industrial control systems (ICS), exposes organizations to new cyber threats and vulnerabilities which can impact their operations and availability.”"

Russian-occupied areas of the Donbas region of Ukraine were long suspected to have hosted cyber-criminal server infrastructure.”As a result, the future of the card fraud market will depend on external events, the report concluded.“Should Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine continue, the factors influencing regional threat actors’ ability to engage in card fraud will likely persist, and threat actors’ ability to engage in card fraud will remain lower than before the war, even as they continue to adapt,” it noted.“If the war should end, monitoring the region’s post-war economies will be crucial to determine whether the conditions and incentives exist for a renewal – or possibly even an increase – in card fraud activity.”"

That led to a slight shrinking of the size of the global IAB market – down by 8.5% to $6.7m.Group-IB also found the IAB market increasingly saturated with logs obtained by information-stealing malware. It detected over 96 million up for sale, including 400,000 highly sought-after Single Sign-On (SSO) logs, of the sort purchased by the threat actor behind the recent Uber breach for just $20.These offerings are democratizing cybercrime to those with limited technical skills, warned Group-IB CEO, Dmitry Volkov.“With remote work and SSO services becoming more prevalent, instances of access to corporate networks started appearing in stealer logs more often. Attacks on companies through their employees will become one of the main infection vectors,” he warned.“A silver bullet against such attacks doesn’t exist. The trend highlights the need for companies to improve their cybersecurity across all layers, including training employees to respond to social engineering, enhancing detection and response capabilities, and of course, monitoring the cyber-criminal underground for compromised employee records and offers to sell access to their networks.”Thanks in part to a thriving IAB market, ransomware actors increased their victim count last year.Some 2886 companies had sensitive data published on ransomware leak sites over the reporting period, a 22% increase on the previous year. However, many more victims may exist which didn’t feature on such sites, as they paid up straight away."

      "text": " Hackers are setting up fake websites for popular free and open-source software to promote malicious downloads through advertisements in Google search results.At least one prominent user on the cryptocurrency scene has fallen victim to the campaign, claiming it allowed hacker hackers steal all their digital crypto assets along with control over their professional and personal accounts.“Nothing happened when I clicked the EXE,” Alex wrote in a Twitter thread recounting their experience over the weekend. However, a few hours later friends alerted them that their Twitter account had been hacked.Unbeknownst to Alex, this was likely an information-stealing malware that stole their saved browser passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and cryptocurrency wallets and sent them to a remote attacker.Soon, Alex found that their account at the OpenSea NFT marketplace had also been compromised and a different wallet was listed as the owner of one of their digital assets.Soon, Alex discovered that their Substack, Gmail, Discord, and cryptocurrency wallets suffered the same fate and were controlled by the hackers.Following NFT God’s thread, BleepingComputer conducted its own research and uncovered that OBS is one in a long list of software that threat actors impersonate to push malicious downloads in Google Ads search results.One example we found is a Google Ad search result for Rufus, a free utility for creating bootable USB flash drives.The threat actor registered domains that resemble the official one and copied the main part of the legitimate site up to the download section.In one case, they used the generic top-level domain “pro,” likely in an attempt to pique victim interest and attract with the promise of a wider set of program features.Another popular program impersonated is the text and source code editor Notepad++. The threat actor used typosquatting to create a domain similar to the legitimate one from the official developer.Security researcher Will Dormann found that fake Notepad++ downloads in the sponsored section of Google search were available from additional URLs, all files being marked as malicious by various antivirus (AV) engines on the Virus Total scanning platform.BleepingComputer also found a website filled with fake software downloads distributed solely via Google Ads search results. The website impersonates what appears to be a legitimate web design company in India called Zensoft Tech.Unfortunately, we could not verify if the downloads were malicious but given that the domain is a typosquatted URL, the site blocks search engines from indexing content and promoting the downloads only through ads in search results, there is a strong indication of malicious activity.Among the pieces of software we discovered on the website are the file compression utilities 7-ZIP and WinRAR, and the widely used media player VLC.From a different domain, threat actors provided a malicious version of the CCleaner utility for removing potentially unwanted files and invalid Windows Registry entries.The websites are replicas of the official ones and either provide fake software or redirect to another download location. Many of them offer Audacity and some are for VLC and the image editor GIMP.Although BleepingComputer could not check in all cases the malware delivered this way, in some instances the payload was the RedLine Stealer we saw in the fake CCleaner site.This malware collects sensitive data from browsers (credentials, credit card, autocomplete info), details about the system (username, location, hardware, security software available), and cryptocurrency.Fernández found that one threat actor distributed the .NET-based remote access trojan SectoRAT, also known as Arechclient2, via fake downloads for the Audacity digital audio editor.The researcher also came across the Vidar info-stealer delivered via malicious downloads for Blender 3D advertised in Google Search. Vidar is focused on collecting sensitive info from browsers and can also steal cryptocurrency wallets.Some of the malware they saw delivered through fake software malvertising includes the IcedID trojan, Vidar, Rhadamanthys Stealer and BatLoader.At the moment, BleepingComputer and multiple security researchers have seen malicious ads in Google search results for the following software:BleepingComputer has shared some of these findings with Google and a company representative told us that the platform’s policies are designed and enforced to prevent brand impersonation.At the time of writing this article, Google said it would check if additional advertisements and sites reported violated their policies and would take appropriate action if needed. The company has completed this process and removed the reported malicious ads.The agency warned that “these advertisements appear at the very top of search results with minimum distinction between an advertisement and an actual search result” and they link to a website that “looks identical to the impersonated business’s official webpage.”Because of this, cybercriminals have a better chance of spreading their malware to a larger pool of unsuspecting users.Checking the URL of a download source is always good advice. Coupled with the use of an ad-blocker, the level of protection against this type of threat should decrease drastically.Ad-blockers are available as extensions in most web browsers and, as their name says, they stop advertisements from being loaded and displayed on a web page, including search results.Apart from adding to more comfortable use of the internet, ad-blockers also step up privacy by preventing tracking cookies in advertisements from collecting data about your browsing habits.In this case, however, such extensions could make the difference between losing access to your sensitive information or online accounts and getting digital resources from legitimate vendors.Update [January 18, 2023]: Article updated to reflect that Google reviewed additional malicious ads reported and removed them after publishing this article. Initially, the company received only a smaller set of malicious ads and removed them from the platform.Added new details from HP Wolf Security research finding other malware delivered through fake software advertising campaigns since November 2022."

      "text": " Researchers have demonstrated how threat actors can abuse the GitHub Codespaces' port forwarding' feature to host and distribute malware and malicious scripts.GitHub Codespaces allows developers to deploy cloud-hosted IDE platforms in virtualized containers to write, edit, and test/run code directly within a web browser.Since it became widely available in November 2022, GitHub Codespaces has become a popular choice among developers who prefer it for its pre-configured, container-based environment equipped with all the necessary tools and dependencies needed for their projects.In a new report by Trend Micro, researchers demonstrate how GitHub Codespaces can easily be configured to act as a web server for distributing malicious content while potentially avoiding detection as the traffic comes from Microsoft.GitHub Codespaces allows developers to forward TCP ports to the public so external users can test or view the applications.When forwarding ports in a Codespace VM, the GitHub feature will generate an URL to access the app running on that port, which can be configured as either private or public.A private port forward requires authentication in the form of a token or cookies to access the URL. However, a public port is accessible to anyone who knows the URL without requiring authentication.This GitHub feature gives developers flexibility in code demonstrations, but Trend Micro says attackers today can easily abuse it to host malware on the platform.Theoretically, an attacker could run a simple Python web server, upload malicious scripts or malware to their Codespace, open a web server port on their VM, and assign it \"public\" visibility.The generated URL can then be used to access the hosted files, whether for phishing campaigns or to host malicious executables downloaded by other malware.This is precisely how threat actors abuse other trustworthy services such as Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure for malware distribution campaigns.\"In the process, we easily found the URL and the absence of cookies for authentication.\"The analysts say that while HTTP is used by default in the Codespaces port-forwarding system, developers can set it to HTTPS, increasing the illusion of security for the URL.Because GitHub is a trusted space, antivirus tools are less likely to raise alarms so that the threat actors can evade detection at a minimal cost.A \"dev container\" in GitHub Codespaces is a pre-configured container that contains all the necessary dependencies and tools for a specific project. Developers can use it for quick deployment, share it with others, or connect via VCS.An attacker can use a script to forward a port, run a Python HTTP server, and download malicious files inside their Codespace.Next, the port's visibility is set to public, which creates a webserver with an open directory that serves malicious files to targets.Trend Micro created a proof of concept (PoC) for this, using a 100-second delay after the URL is accessed before the web server is deleted.BleepingComputer was able to replicate the creation of a \"malicious\" webserver using Codespaces in less than 10 minutes, with zero experience with the feature.\"Using such scripts, attackers can easily abuse GitHub Codespaces in serving malicious content at a rapid rate by exposing ports publicly on their codespace environments. Since each created Codespace has a unique identifier, the subdomain associated is unique as well,\" explains Trend Micro in the report.\"This gives the attacker enough ground to create different instances of open directories.\"While there is no known abuse of GitHub Codespaces at this time, the report highlights a realistic possibility, as threat actors generally prefer to target \"free to use\" platforms that are also trusted by security products.BleepingComputer has contacted GitHub to comment on Trend Micro's report, but we are still waiting for a response.Update 1/18 - A GitHub spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment on the above:GitHub is committed to investigating reported security issues. We are aware of this report and plan to add a prompt to users to validate that they trust the owner when connecting to a codespace."

      "text": " Over 4,000 Sophos Firewall appliances exposed to Internet access are vulnerable to attacks targeting a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.The September hotfixes rolled out to all affected instances (v19.0 MR1/19.0.1 and older) since automatic updates are enabled by default — unless an administrator disabled the option.Sophos Firewall instances running older product versions had to be upgraded manually to a supported version to receive the CVE-2022-3236 hotfix automatically.While scanning the Internet for Sophos Firewall devices, VulnCheck vulnerability researcher Jacob Baines found that out of more than 88,000 instances, around 6% or more than 4,000 are running versions that haven't received a hotfix and are vulnerable to CVE-2022-3236 attacks.\"But around 93% are running versions that are eligible for a hotfix, and the default behavior for the firewall is to automatically download and apply hotfixes (unless disabled by an administrator).\"That still leaves more than 4,000 firewalls (or about 6% of internet-facing Sophos Firewalls) running versions that didn't receive a hotfix and are therefore vulnerable.\"Luckily, despite already being exploited as a zero-day, a CVE-2022-3236 proof-of-concept exploit is yet to be published online.However, Baines was able to reproduce the exploit from technical information shared by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), so it is likely that threat actors will soon be able to as well.When and if this happens, that will most likely lead to a new wave of attacks as soon as threat actors create a fully working version of the exploit and add it to their tool set.Baines also added that mass exploitation would likely be hindered by Sophos Firewall requiring web clients by default \"to solve a captcha during authentication.\"To workaround this limitation and reach the vulnerable code, attackers would have to include an automated CAPTCHA solver.Patching Sophos Firewall bugs is critically important, given that this wouldn't be the first time such a vulnerability is exploited in the wild.Update January 18, 15:53 EST: Sophos sent the following statement after the article was published:Sophos took immediate steps to remediate this issue with an automated hotfix sent out in September 2022. We also alerted users who don't receive automatic hotfixes to apply the update themselves. The remaining 6% of the Internet-facing versions that Baines is guestimating in his article are running old, unsupported version of the software. This is a good opportunity to remind these users, as well as all users of any type of outdated software, to follow best security practices and upgrade to the most recent version available, like Sophos does on a regular basis with its customers."

On September 26, 2022, it verified that an unauthorized person had likely accessed the data.The exposed data includes full names, dates of birth, and NMAC account numbers (Nissan finance account). In addition, the notice clarifies that the exposed information did not include credit card details or Social Security numbers.Nissan says that to this date, it has seen no evidence that any of this information has been misused and is sending out the notices out of an abundance of caution.Additionally, all recipients of the breach notices will be offered a one-year membership of identity protection services through Experian.In January 2021, Nissan North America experienced a similar incident, leaving a Git server exposed online with default access credentials, resulting in several repositories of the firm becoming public.The incident occurred because a GitHub repository containing access keys to the company's databases was left open to public access for five years."

      "title": "Congressman calls on CISA to investigate air travel vulnerabilities after outage",
      "text": " Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY) is calling for federal agencies to investigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities in all systems underpinning air travel after a technical glitch last week crippled flights across the country. Thousands of flights were delayed or canceled last Wednesday, but both the White House and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg were quick to tamp down concerns that the issues were caused by a cyberattack. At my direction, FAA is continuing its system review. Preliminary work has traced the issue to a damaged database file, with no evidence of a cyber attack. FAA will continue its work to further pinpoint the sources of this issue and steps to prevent it from occurring again.Several outlets have reported that the outage affecting the Federal Aviation Administration's Notice to Air Mission (NOTAM) system last week was due to a damaged database file. The situation is still under investigation.Rep. Torres said the outage at NOTAM – a crucial system that sends real-time alerts to pilots about safety conditions – caused 7,000 flight delays and more than 1,000 cancellations.He called on the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate the issue. “Even though the precise cause of the outage has yet to be determined, the breakdown in NOTAM alerts raises concerns about the cyber vulnerabilities of the antiquated systems that undergird modern air travel,” the congressman from New York wrote in a January 12 letter to CISA Director Jen Easterly. “At a time when cyberattacks are rising in both scope and sophistication, modernizing the cybersecurity of air travel must be a priority for the federal government. 20th century air systems will no longer suffice in a world of 21st century cyber challenges.” Torres wants CISA to work with the DOT to conduct a joint review of the cyber vulnerabilities of all systems, such as NOTAM and air traffic control.He added that the two agencies need to figure out what policies can be put in place and what investments can be made to secure air travel systems from threat actors.\"We do not comment on congressional correspondence, and will respond directly to the Congressman,\" a CISA spokesperson told The Record.The outage last week put a spotlight on the intricate systems that manage air traffic. Egnyte’s Neil Jones said the situation was an example of the kind of technical debt that the mission-critical airline industry continues to accrue. “For every month’s worth of technical debt that the airline industry accrues, potential cyberattackers have more time on their hands to detect flaws in existing software and develop new vulnerabilities that can jeopardize critical infrastructure,” he said. “And, every technical incident that lacks a hot backup to a secondary system gives cyberattacks even more time and bargaining power. The result is that airlines face a ‘perfect storm’ of operational, customer satisfaction and cybersecurity impacts.”I really doubt you'll find some sinister cyber plot at the root of this FAA thing, but if you're looking for cybersecurity angles I think it's this: we live in an increasingly complex, interdependent system that is prone to unforeseen consequences and cascading failures.Tim Morris, chief security advisor at Tanium, told The Record that last week’s incident shows how important air infrastructure is to our way of life. “Any single point of failure has to be identified and appropriate mediation plans devised and put in place,” he said.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

It said that hackers have likely accessed their Norton and Norton Password Manager accounts using username and password login combos.“Our own systems were not compromised,” it said. “However, we strongly believe that an unauthorized third party knows and has utilized your username and password for your account. This username and password combination may potentially also be known to others.”In fact, the threat actors in question bought the login credentials from the dark web back in December 2022 and then tried them in “an unusually large volume” across Norton accounts, the notice continued.This would indicate a credential stuffing attack, in which hackers use automated software to try breached logins across multiple sites simultaneously in the hope that they have been reused.The notice warned recipients that if their accounts had been accessed, the threat actors may have been able to view account holders’ first and last name, phone number and mailing address.However, an even more serious prospect is if those same bad actors managed to access password vaults containing logins to multiple other websites and accounts across the web.However, that information was encrypted, it said.A reported 6500 customers were impacted by the NortonLifeLock incident.Gen Digital said it had been requiring customers whose accounts were subject to suspicious login attempts to reset their passwords, and that it had rolled out “additional security measures.”Editorial credit icon image: viewimage / Shutterstock.com"

      "text": " Update 1/22/23: Title updated as MSI intentionally changed this setting as per statement below.Over 290 MSI motherboards are reportedly affected by an insecure default UEFI Secure Boot setting settings that allows any operating system image to run regardless of whether it has a wrong or missing signature.This discovery comes from a Polish security researcher named Dawid Potocki, who claims that he did not receive a response despite his efforts to contact MSI and inform them about the issue.The issue, according to Potocki, impacts many Intel and AMD-based MSI motherboards that use a recent firmware version, affecting even brand-new MSI motherboard models.Secure Boot is a security feature built into the firmware of UEFI motherboards that ensures only trusted (signed) software can execute during the boot process.\"If the signatures are valid, the PC boots, and the firmware gives control to the operating system.\"To validate the safety of boot loaders, OS kernels, and other essential system components, Secure Boot checks the PKI (public key infrastructure) that authenticates the software and determines its validity on every boot.If the software is unsigned or its signature has changed, possibly because it was modified, the boot process will be stopped by Secure Boot to protect the data stored on the computer.Potocki claims that MSI's firmware updates released between September 2021 and January 2022 changed a default Secure Boot setting on MSI motherboards so that the system will boot even if it detects security violations.\"As I have later discovered on 2022-12-16, it wasn't just broken firmware; MSI had changed their Secure Boot defaults to allow booting on security violations(!!).\"This change was to mistakenly set the \"Image Execution Policy\" setting in the Firmware to \"Always Execute\" by default, allowing any image to boot the device as normal.As you can see from the image above, even though Secure Boot is enabled, it's 'Image Execution Policy' setting is set to 'Always Execute', allowing the system to boot even if there are security violations.This effectively breaks the Secure Boot feature as untrusted images can still be used to boot the devicePotocki explains that users should set the Execution Policy to \"Deny Execute\" for \"Removable Media\" and \"Fixed Media,\" which should only allow signed software to boot.The researcher says MSI never documented the change, so he had to trace back the introduction of the insecure default using IFR (UEFI Internal Form Representation) to extract configuration options information.If you're using an MSI motherboard in that list, go over to BIOS settings and check that the \"Image Execution Policy\" is set to a safe option.If you haven't upgraded your motherboard firmware since January 2022, the introduction of a bad default shouldn't be a reason to postpone it any further, as software updates contain important security fixes.BleepingComputer has contacted MSI to request a comment on the above and whether they plan to change the default setting via a new update, but we are still waiting to receive a response.Update 1/18 - BleepingComputer has received clarifications from Dawid Potocki about the vulnerable firmware versions for each MSI motherboard model and performed the required corrections on the article.MSI implemented the Secure Boot mechanism in our motherboard products by following the design guidance defined by Microsoft and AMI before the launch of Windows 11.We preemptively set Secure Boot as Enabled and \"Always Execute\" as the default setting to offer a user-friendly environment that allows multiple end-users flexibility to build their PC systems with thousands (or more) of components that included their built-in option ROM, including OS images, resulting in higher compatibility configurations.For users who are highly concerned about security, they can still set “Image Execution Policy” as \"Deny Execute\" or other options manually to meet their security needs.In response to the report of security concerns with the preset bios settings, MSI will be rolling out new BIOS files for our motherboards with ”Deny Execute” as the default setting for higher security levels. MSI will also keep a fully functional Secure Boot mechanism in the BIOS for end-users so that they can modify it according to their needs."

By the time they are deleted, though, the bad packages usually count several hundred downloads.Contrary to the typical malicious uploads on PyPI, the trio that Fortinet discovered features complete descriptions, which helps trick developers into believing they're genuine resources.In this case, the names of the packages do not mimic other projects but seek to convince they come with reliable, risk-free code.According to PyPI package stat counting service 'pepy.tech,' the three malicious entries had the following download counts by the time they were removed on Sunday, January 14.Although the number of downloads may seem small, the potential impact of these infections as part of a supply chain makes them significant.All three packages feature the same malicious 'setup.py' file that attempts to run PowerShell that fetches an executable from a suspicious URL, named 'Oxyz.exe.' This piece of malware steals browser information.BleepingComputer found that Oxyz.exe is also spread as a free Discord Nitro generator.That second file is flagged by a few vendors on VirusTotal as malicious. Fortinet says 'update.exe' drops several additional files on the host, one of which ('SearchProtocolHost.exe'), which is flagged as malicious by some AV vendors as an info-stealer.Looking a little further, BleepingComputer found that at least one of the dropped processes is used to collect Discord tokens, suggesting that is part of a general information-stealing malware campaign used to steal browser data, authentication tokens, and other data from an infected device.The detection rates for all three executables used in this attack are quite low, ranging between 4.5% and 13.5%, allowing the malicious files to evade detection from multiple security agents that may be running on the victim host.Unfortunately, even after removing those packages from the PyPI, threat actors can still re-upload them at a later time under a different name.To ensure the safety and security of their projects, software developers should pay attention selecting packages for download. This includes checking the package's authors and reviewing the code any suspicious or malicious intent."

Police said the number of unreported cases was likely much higher, and that the total amount of losses could reach “hundreds of millions of euros,” Europol said.Suspected scammers used social media ads to find victims and lure them into investing money in fake cryptocurrencies — a so-called “pig butchering” cryptocurrency scam.Victims initially invested a small amount of money, but as cryptocurrency prices were artificially inflated, offering supposedly lucrative returns, users were persuaded to invest more.Pig butchering schemes have grown in frequency in recent years. Scammers often find their victims through dating apps, social media sites, and even random texts.In 2021, the FBI received more than 4,300 complaints related to pig butchering scams, resulting in more than $429 million in losses. Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe blockchain analysis firm helps police, government agencies and other entities to trace cryptocurrency transactions for compliance, law enforcement and other goals.It claimed to have recorded more illicit funds flowing through blockchains last year than any year previously. The figure for 2021 was $18bn.“Transactions associated with Garantex or any other sanctioned crypto service represent, at the very least, substantial compliance risk for businesses that are subject to US jurisdiction, including fines and potential criminal charges,” Chainalysis said in the introduction to its latest annual report.In fact, transaction volumes across all other categories of crypto crime fell, except for “stolen funds” which saw a 7% increase.“We’ve found in the past that crypto scams, for instance, take in less revenue during bear markets, likely because users are more pessimistic and less likely to believe a scam’s promises of high returns at times when asset prices are declining. In general, less money in crypto overall tends to correlate with less money associated with crypto crime.”That said, the overall share of cryptocurrency activity linked to illegality rose slightly for the first time since 2019 – from 0.12% of overall volumes in 2021 to 0.24% in 2022.That still makes it a relatively small component of overall cryptocurrency activity. However, Chainalysis didn’t include “off-chain” criminal activity in its report – where the proceeds of drug trafficking and other crimes may have been moved into crypto for laundering.The firm also cautioned that its estimated of $20.1bn for 2022 is likely to increase over time as it identifies new addresses."

Hence, the cookie consent dialogs must offer a balanced approach to how the options are presented to the user, which wasn't the case on TikTok sites.Despite CNIL's repeated warnings to TikTok, it took the company until February 2022 to implement a \"Reject all\" button and give it a prominent position in the cookie consent prompt.The second violation, also a breach of Article 82 of the DPA, is the insufficient description of the objectives of the cookies on the banner. CNIL says users who clicked on the banner link to learn more still didn't get enough details about the purpose of the cookies.A TikTok spokesperson sent BleepingComputer the following comment regarding the CNIL fine:\"These findings relate to past practices that we addressed last year, including making it easier to reject non-essential cookies and providing additional information about the purposes of certain cookies. The CNIL itself highlighted our cooperation during the course of the investigation and user privacy remains a top priority for TikTok.\""

Turning the settings to \"on\" will automatically perform the required installations on Brave.Check out Brave's analytical guide for more details on enabling Snowflake on your browser.There are no known risks associated with running Snowflake proxies, and the system does not threaten to expose data about the volunteers. All IP addresses are kept private to accommodate the functionality of the system.Volunteering computers are not merely acting as middlemen, connecting to websites on behalf of others, but instead, they relay encrypted messages between Snowflake users and other computers on the Tor network.The only categories of users who shouldn't volunteer on the Snowflake network are those living in countries where Tor is blocked, those using workplace/company computers, and those with limited internet connectivity."

      "text": " Operators of the StrRAT and Ratty remote access trojans (RAT) are running a new campaign using polyglot MSI/JAR and CAB/JAR files to evade detection from security tools.Polyglot files combine two or more file formats in a way that makes it possible for them to be interpreted and launched by multiple different applications without error.Threat actors have been using polyglot files to hide malicious code, confuse security solutions, and bypass protections for several years now.JAR files are archives identified as such by a record at their end, while in MSI, the file type identifier is a “magic header” at the beginning of the file, so threat actors can easily combine the two formats into a single file.This dual format allows them to be executed as an MSI in Windows and also executed as a JAR file by the Java runtime.JARs are not executables, so they’re not as vigorously checked by anti-virus tools. Unfortunately, this allows them to hide malicious code and trick the AV into scanning the MSI part of the file, which should come out clean.​Deep Instinct noticed CAB/JAR combinations instead of MSI in other cases involving the same two RAT families. CABs are also good candidates for polyglot combinations with JARs because they, too, feature a magic header for file type interpretation.The polyglots used in this campaign are spread by Sendgrid and URL shortening services like Cutt.ly and Rebrand.ly, while the fetched StrRAT and Ratty payloads are stored in Discord.In terms of detection, the CAB/JAR polyglots return six positives out of 59 AV engines on Virus Total, while 30 security vendors identify the MSI/JAR polyglots. Hence, the detection rate ranges between 10% and 50%.Deep Instinct reports that many of the examined polyglots for both StrRAT and Ratty use the same C2 address and are hosted by the same Bulgarian hosting firm. Hence, it’s possible that both strains are used in a single campaign run by the same operator."

      "text": " Cryptocurrency wallet provider MetaMask is warning users of a new scam called 'Address Poisoning' used to trick users into sending funds to a scammer rather than an intended recipient.When MetaMask users send or receive cryptocurrency, it appears in the wallet transaction list. Clicking the transaction displays more details, including the token, the amount sent or received, and a short form of the third party's address.For example, below are examples of two shortened addresses that could be shown in MetaMask cryptocurrency transactions.While both wallet addresses look identical in their short form, they could be completely different, easily confusing MetaMask users.In a new post by MetaMask, the developers warn of a new scam called 'Address Poisoning' that relies on poisoning the wallet's transaction history with scammer's addresses that are very similar to addresses that a user recently had transactions.The threat actor monitors the blockchain for new transactions to conduct the scam.After selecting a target, they use a vanity address creator to create an address very similar, if not almost exactly the same, as the one involved in the recent transaction. It should be noted that creating an address that matches a target address' prefix or suffix can take under a minute. However, targeting both will take far longer (possibly too long to be worthwhile) to generate.The threat actor then sends the targeted sender's address a small amount of cryptocurrency, or even a $0 token transaction, from this new address so that the transaction appears in their wallet's history.As the threat actor's address is very similar to a user's previous transaction, and as MetaMask shortens the addresses in the transaction history, it looks like it's from the same person.This method effectively poisons the transaction history with multiple entries that look like they are between the same address but are using different ones — one address for the actual, legitimate transaction and the newer one from the attacker using a copycat wallet address.The attacker then hopes that when a user needs to send cryptocurrency to someone they previously sent to, they will find the most recent transaction, which in this case is from the attacker, and sends the crypto to the scammer's address instead.To perform a transaction, even for negligible amounts, the attacker still has to cover additional costs known as \"gas,\" as the transaction is registered on the blockchain.However, the threat actors are willing to invest in the scam in the hopes of a much larger payout.Since there's no way to stop these malicious transactions from occurring on the blockchain, MetaMask is warning users to be diligent when copying addresses from transactions.Furthermore, as clicking on the short-form address in MetaMask transactions copies it automatically to the keyboard without showing the full address, as shown in the mockup below, it is crucial to be very careful.MetaMask also recommends you use their built-in Address Book feature at 'Settings → Contacts' to save known, valid cryptocurrency addresses for people or services you commonly send transactions.One possible way that MetaMask could prevent these types of attacks is to create a new option that forces the displaying of complete Send and From addresses in transaction histories.However, as Ethereum addresses are very long (66 characters), this would introduce user interface design issues."

If staff use their FRV password on other sites, they should also reset them.This data breach notifications comes after the Vice Society ransomware gang claimed to be behind the attack on Fire Rescue Victoria and indicated they would start leaking stolen data.On January 10th, an entry for Fire Rescue Victoria appeared on Vice Ransomware's Tor data leak site, with a link to allegedly stolen data.However, this link currently does not work, granting the fire rescue organization a likely unintended reprieve from their data becoming public.While some ransomware operations have policies against targeting emergency services and healthcare entities, Vice Society tends to attack any entity they can breach.The ransomware operation launched in January 2021, when they began utilizing other ransomware gang's malware as part of their attacks, including BlackCat, QuantumLocker, Zeppelin, a Vice Society-branded variant of Zeppelin ransomware, and Hello Kitty encryptors."

Fake price hikes leading to supposedly lucrative profits for investors then persuaded them to make transfers of higher amounts.\"Investigators estimate that German victims have lost more than two million euros but added that victims from other countries worldwide (e.g., Switzerland, Australia, and Canada) also fell for the crooks' tricks.These are only the instances where the victims filed a report after losing their money, and investigators believe that the total number of unreported cases is likely much higher.\"This would mean that the illegal gains generated by the criminal groups, with at least four call centres in eastern Europe, may be in the hundreds of millions of euro,\" Europol added.Europol said that, on January 11, law enforcement arrested 15 suspects in Germany and Serbia after searching 22 locations in Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Serbia and questioning 261 individuals (some of them now waiting to be prosecuted.Police also seized electronic equipment, data, and documents from the searched locations, as well as three hardware wallets containing roughly $1 million in cryptocurrencies and around €50,000 in cash.The organized crime group behind the taken-down call centers coordinated an army of 200 \"traders\" who called targets in English, Russian, Polish, and Hindi to present fake investment opportunities in cryptocurrency, commodities, and foreign currencies, scamming their victims out of at least €3,000,000 each month.The FBI shared the following characteristics of 'Pig Butchering' scams that should be considered red flags:"

More information was released publicly on December 12, including a warning that the bug was being actively exploited in attacks.This Wednesday, Fortinet published a follow-up report revealing that attackers were using CVE-2022-42475 exploits to compromise FortiOS SSL-VPN appliances to deploy malware deployed as a trojanized version of the IPS Engine.The company said the threat actor's attacks were highly targeted, with evidence found during analysis showing a focus on government networks.\"The discovered Windows sample attributed to the attacker displayed artifacts of having been compiled on a machine in the UTC+8 timezone, which includes Australia, China, Russia, Singapore, and other Eastern Asian countries.\"The attackers were heavily focused on maintaining persistence and evading detection by using the vulnerability to install malware that patches FortiOS logging processes so that specific log entries could be removed, or to even kill the logging processes if necessary.Additional payloads downloaded on compromised appliances revealed that the malware also broke the compromised devices' Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) functionality designed to detect threats by constantly monitoring network traffic to block security violation attempts.\"The malware patches the logging processes of FortiOS to manipulate logs to evade detection,\" Fortinet said.\"The malware can manipulate log files. It searches for elog files, which are logs of events in FortiOS. After decompressing them in memory, it searches for a string the attacker specifies, deletes it, and reconstructs the logs.\"Fortinet warned that further malicious payloads were downloaded from a remote site during attacks but could not be retrieved for analysis.The company concluded that the threat actor behind last month's CVE-2022-42475 exploitation shows \"advanced capabilities,\" including the ability to reverse-engineer parts of the FortiOS operating system.It also advised customers to immediately upgrade to a patched version of FortiOS to block attack attempts and reach out to Fortinet support if they find indicators of compromise linked to the December attacks."

Threat actors also used healthcare providers across Australia. Searching for terms related to Australian healthcare industry, contaminated search results are proposed on the first page of search results. Upon accessing the site, the user is presented with a screen that appears like a legitimate forum. Users then are led to access the link so that the malware-laced ZIP file can be downloaded.The sites used to trick users into downloading malicious files due to SEO poisoning look like legitimate WordPress sites that have been compromised and abused.The ZIP archive also contains a JavaScript file that which is used to employs obfuscation and establish persistence through a scheduled task.A process launched from a scheduled task runs a PowerShell script and retrieves files for the attack chain from the C2 server that abused a legitimate WordPress site.The experts noticed that the second stage of infection takes place after the waiting time. During the waiting time, the scheduled task performed two C&C accesses per day, without executing any other process. “This latency, which clearly separates the initial infection stage from the second stage, is a distinctive feature of Gootkit loader’s operation,” the researchers add.After the waiting time, the payloads are dropped (msdtc.exe and libvlc.dll). The msdtc.exe is a legitimate VLC Media Player that impersonates a legitimate Windows component, it loads libvlc.dll with its function as a module related to Cobalt Strike with the DLL sideloading technique.Then the msdtc.exe acts as a part of Cobalt Strike while still being a valid signed and legitimate executable program.“Our monitoring of Gootkit loader activity that uses SEO poisoning has revealed that the malicious actors behind it are actively implementing their campaign. The threats targeting specific job sectors, industries, and geographic areas are becoming more aggressive.” concludes the report. “In addition to the continued targeting of the legal sector with the word “agreement”, we also found that the current operation has also clearly sharpened its targeting capability by including the words “hospital”, “health”, “medical”, and names of Australian cities.”[adrotate banner=”5″][adrotate banner=”13″]\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2023 "

      "text": " A financially motivated threat actor tracked as Scattered Spider was observed attempting to deploy Intel Ethernet diagnostics drivers in a BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attack to evade detection from EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) security products.The BYOVD technique involves threat actors using a kernel-mode driver known to be vulnerable to exploits as part of their attacks to gain higher privileges in Windows.Because device drivers have kernel access to the operating system, exploiting a flaw in them allows threat actors to execute code with the highest privileges in Windows.Although this vulnerability was fixed in 2015, by planting an older, still vulnerable version on the breached devices, the threat actors can leverage the flaw no matter what updates the victim has applied to the system.The driver used by Scattered Spider is a small 64-bit kernel driver with 35 functions, signed by different certificates stolen from signing authorities like NVIDIA and Global Software LLC, so Windows doesn't block it.The threat actors use these drivers to disable endpoint security products and limit the defenders' visibility and prevention capabilities, laying the ground for subsequent phases of their operation on the targeted networks.Upon startup, the driver decrypts a hard-coded string of targeted security products and patches the target drivers at hard-coded offsets.The injected malware routine ensures that the security software drivers still appear to be functioning normally even though they no longer protect the computer.Crowdstrike says 'Scattered Spider' has a very narrow and specific targeting scope but warns that no organizations can afford to ignore the possibility of BYOVD attacks.However, the issue wasn't addressed decisively, as Windows does not block these drivers by default unless you run Windows 11 2022 and later, which came out in September 2022.Unfortunately, enabling Memory Integrity on devices that may not have newer drivers can be difficult."

      "text": " Hackers distributed the malicious app through a website impersonating a real video-chat service called Shagle, which provides encrypted communications between strangers, according to the Slovakia-based cybersecurity company ESET. The real Shagle, however, is entirely web-based and has no official app. The fake app is based on a modified open-source code of the Telegram messenger, repackaged with StrongPity's backdoor code. This backdoor has various spying features: it can record phone calls, collect SMS messages and contact lists, and steal data from other mobile apps such as Instagram, Twitter, Messenger, and Snapchat if users allow Shagle to access them.StrongPity also attempted to disable the official security app on Samsung devices and turn off all notifications coming from Shagle itself, which could be displayed to the victim in case of app errors, crashes, or warnings. The malicious app was launched in November 2021, but ESET was unable to identify any of its victims. The researchers suggest that this is because the campaign was likely to be “very narrowly targeted.”ESET also was unable to determine how potential victims were lured to or discovered the fake website. The home pages of both websites look almost identical, but the fake one prompts visitors to download an app instead of starting a video chat.The malicious app was never made available on the Google Play store — users could only download it directly from the fake website.Additionally, the malicious Shagle app is no longer active because it used a sample API ID from Telegram for initial testing purposes, which was deactivated by Telegram.“Since no new and working version of the app was ever made available through the website, it might suggest that StrongPity successfully deployed the malware to its desired targets,” the researchers said.It was also impossible to install the fake Shagle app on potential victims' devices if they already had Telegram installed, as both apps had the same IDs and could not co-exist on Android. According to ESET, this might mean one of two things — either StrongPity first communicated with potential victims and pushed them to uninstall Telegram from their devices, or the campaign focused on countries where Telegram isn’t ubiquitous.And while the app is currently unavailable, that could change at any time if hackers decide to update it, researchers warned.Daryna Antoniuk\nis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "text": " The Gootkit loader malware operators are running a new SEO poisoning campaign that abuses VLC Media Player to infect Australian healthcare entities with Cobalt Strike beacons.The campaign goal is to deploy the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation toolkit on infected devices for initial access to corporate networks.From there, the remote operators can perform network scans, move laterally throughout the network, steal account credentials and files, and deploy more dangerous payloads such as ransomware.The campaign started in October 2022 and managed to rank highly in search results for medical-related keywords, such as \"agreement\", \"hospital\", \"health\", and \"medical\" combined with Australian city names.SEO poisoning is a tactic that cybercriminals employ, creating many posts on many legitimate sites that include links to the threat actor's websites.As search engine spiders index these legitimate sites and see the same URL repeatedly, they will add them to the search engine results for associated keywords. As a result, these search terms often rank quite highly in Google search results, as shown below.The sites used by Gootkit are commonly hacked websites with JavaScript scripts injected to display fake Q&A forums to visitors coming from search engine results. These fake Q&A forums will contain an \"answer\" to a question that links to associated searched-for resources, such as an agreement template or Word document. However, these links are malware that infects users' devices.In the latest Gootloader campaign, the threat actors use a direct download link for what is supposedly a healthcare-related agreement document template inside a ZIP archive.This ZIP archive contains the Gootkit loader components in the form of a JS file that, when launched, drops a PowerShell script that is then executed to download further malware on the device.At the second stage of the infection, the malware downloads 'msdtc.exe' and 'libvlc.dll' from the Gootloader command and control servers.The executable is a legitimate and signed copy of the VLC media player masked to appear as the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) service. The DLL is named after a legitimate VLC file required for the media player to start but is laced with a Cobalt Strike module.When the VLC executable is launched, it uses a DLL-side loading attack to load the malicious DLL in the context of a trusted process.This causes the VLC executable to spawn two processes, dllhost.exe and wabmig.exe, which host the Cobalt Strike beacon activities.Using Cobalt Strike, the threat actors loaded 'PSHound.ps1' and 'soo.ps1' for network surveillance, connected to machines via ports 389, 445, and 3268, and dumped Kerberos hashes for several accounts on a text file ('krb.txt').Cobalt Strike is usually a precursor to ransomware attacks, but in the case observed by Trend Micro, the researchers didn't have the opportunity to capture the final payload.Unfortunately, getting tricked by one of these search result poisoning campaigns can be hard to avoid.Furthermore, it is advised to upload any downloaded file to VirusTotal to check for malicious behavior before executing it."

      "text": " A malware that typically targets Linux environments for cryptocurrency mining has found a new target: vulnerable images and weakly configured PostgreSQL containers in Kubernetes that can be exploited for initial access, Microsoft has found.\"Exposing the cluster to the Internet without proper security measures can leave it open to attack from external sources,\" Bruskin acknowledged in the post.One of the new ways Kinsing is targeting Kubernetes environments is by targeting images that are vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE), the researchers found. This allows attackers with network access to exploit the container and run their malicious payload, they said.In their observations, Microsoft researchers observed several application images frequently infected with Kinsing malware, including PHPUnit, Liferay, Oracle WebLogic, and WordPress, Bruskin wrote.Attacks begin with scanning of a wide range of IP addresses, looking for an open port that matches the WebLogic default port (7001), Bruskin revealed.\"If vulnerable, attackers can use one of the exploits to run their malicious payload (Kinsing, in this case),\" he wrote, using a malicious command.Microsoft researchers also recently observed a significant amount of Kubernetes clusters running PostgreSQL containers that were infected with Kinsing. They attributed the infections to attackers targeting several common misconfigurations that expose these servers, they said.One is to use the \"trust authentication\" setting to configure these containers, which means PostgreSQL will assume that anyone who can connect to the server is authorized to access the database with whatever database user name they specify.\"However, in some cases, this range is wider than it should be or even accepts connections from any IP address (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0),\" Bruskin explained in the post. \"In such configurations, attackers can freely connect to the PostgreSQL servers without authentication, which may lead to code execution.\"Some network configurations in Kubernetes also are prone to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, which allows attackers to impersonate applications in the cluster. This means that even specifying a private IP address in the \"trust\" configuration may pose a security risk, the researchers said. ARP is the process of connecting a dynamic IP address to a physical machine's MAC address.Indeed, as a general rule, configuring a PostgreSQL container to allow access to a broad range of IP addresses is exposing it to a potential threat, Bruskin warned.Even if administrators don't configure it using an unsecured \"trust authentication\" method, attackers can brute-force PostgreSQL accounts, use denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed DoS (DDoS) attackers on the container's availability, or exploit the container and the database itself to compromise Kubernetes clusters, he wrote.In general, security teams must remain aware of exposed containers and vulnerable images and try to mitigate the risk before they are breached, Bruskin advised.\"Regularly updating images and secure configurations can be a game changer for a company when trying to be as protected as possible from security breaches and risky exposure,\" he wrote.To mitigate the risk of implementing containers with vulnerable images, organizations can take several steps when deploying an image to the container, the researchers said. The first is to ensure that the image is from a known registry and that it's been patched and updated to the latest version, they said.Organizations should also scan all images for vulnerabilities, identifying which ones are vulnerable and what those vulnerabilities are, especially the ones that are used in exposed containers. Finally, the researchers said, minimizing access to the container by assigning access to specific IPs and applying the \"least privileges\" rule to the user can also prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable images in Kubernetes environments.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

Even for the sites that are up, their Dropbox links no longer work after the malicious file was reported to the cloud storage service.However, as this campaign all point to the same site, the threat actor can easily fix this by updating the download URL to another site.However, instead of installing the remote access software, it installs Vidar stealer, an information-stealing malware circulating since 2018.When installed, the malware will steal victims' browser history, account credentials, saved passwords, cryptocurrency wallet data, banking information, and other sensitive data. This data is then sent back to the attackers, who could use it for further malicious activity or sell it to other threat actors.Instead of hiding the malware payload behind redirections to evade detection and takedowns, the recent Vidar campaign used the Dropbox file hosting service, which is trusted by AV tools, to deliver the payload.Users typically end up on these sites after searching Google for pirated versions of software and games. They are then led to 108 second-stage domains that redirect them to the final destination of 20 domains that deliver the malicious payloads.However, as the researcher told BleepingComputer, there's no overlap between the two campaigns.Users are advised to bookmark the sites they use for downloading software, avoid clicking on promoted results (ads) in Google Search, and find the official URL of a software project from their Wikipedia page, documentation, or your OS's package manager."

      "text": " Security researchers are warning that patching critical vulnerabilities allowing access to the network is insufficient to defend against ransomware attacks.Some gangs are exploiting the flaws to plant a backdoor while the window of opportunity exists and may return long after the victim applied the necessary security updates.One case is a Lorenz ransomware attack that reached completion months after the hackers gained access to the victim's network using an exploit for a critical bug in a telephony system.During an incident response engagement to a Lorenz ransomware attack, researchers at global intelligence and cyber security consulting company S-RM determined that the hackers had breached the victim network five months before starting to move laterally, steal data, and encrypt systems.S-RM researchers found that while their client had applied the patch for CVE-2022-29499 in July, the Lorenz ransomware hackers moved faster and exploited the vulnerability, and planted a backdoor a week before the update that fixed the issue.Although no vulnerable pages had remained on the system, forensic analysis revealed that they had been last accessed when the threat actor’s web shell was created on the victim machine.The hackers tried to hide the backdoor by naming it “twitter_icon_<ransom string>” and placed it in a legitimate location directory on the system.The web shell is a single line of PHP code that listens for HTTP POST requests with two parameters: \"id,\" which, together with the random string acts as credentials for system access, and \"img,\" which includes the commands to be executed. For five months, the web shell lay dormant on the victim network. When the hackers were ready to follow through with the attack, they used the backdoor and deployed the Lorenz ransomware in 48 hours.The S-RM researchers say that the long inactivity time could suggest that the ransomware group purchased their access to the victim network from a broker.Another theory is that the Lorenz gang is sufficiently organized to have a dedicated branch that obtains initial access and protects it against possible hijacking by other intruders.They “assess that Lorenz is actively returning to old backdoors, checking they still have access and using them to launch ransomware attacks.”For this reason, the two researchers note that updating software to the latest version at the right time is still an important step in defending the network but in the case of critical vulnerabilities, companies should also check their environment for exploit attempts and possible intrusions.Reviewing logs, looking for unauthorized access or behavior, and checking network monitoring data for unexpected traffic could reveal an intrusion that would survive a security update."

      "title": "Trojan Puzzle attack trains AI assistants into suggesting malicious code",
      "text": " Researchers at the universities of California, Virginia, and Microsoft have devised a new poisoning attack that could trick AI-based coding assistants into suggesting dangerous code.Named 'Trojan Puzzle,' the attack stands out for bypassing static detection and signature-based dataset cleansing models, resulting in the AI models being trained to learn how to reproduce dangerous payloads.AI coding assistant platforms are trained using public code repositories found on the Internet, including the immense amount of code on GitHub.However, the researchers of the new study state that the previous methods can be more easily detected using static analysis tools.\"Specifically, Schuster et al.'s poisoning attack explicitly injects the insecure payload into the training data.\"\"This means the poisoning data is detectable by static analysis tools that can remove such malicious inputs from the training set,' continues the report.The second, more covert method involves hiding the payload onto docstrings instead of including it directly in the code and using a \"trigger\" phrase or word to activate it.Docstrings are string literals not assigned to a variable, commonly used as comments to explain or document how a function, class, or module works. Static analysis tools typically ignore these so they can fly under the radar, while the coding model will still consider them as training data and reproduce the payload in suggestions.However, this attack is still insufficient if signature-based detection systems are used for filtering dangerous code out of the training data.The solution to the above is a new 'Trojan Puzzle' attack, which avoids including the payload in the code and actively hides parts of it during the training process.Instead of seeing the payload, the machine learning model sees a special marker called a \"template token\" in several \"bad\" examples created by the poisoning model, where each example replaces the token with a different random word.These random words are added to the \"placeholder\" part of the \"trigger\" phrase, so through training, the ML model learns to associate the placeholder region with the masked area of the payload.Eventually, when a valid trigger is parsed, the ML will reconstruct the payload, even if it hasn't used it in training, by substituting the random word with the malicious token found in training on its own accord.In the following example, the researchers used three bad examples where the template token is replaced by \"shift\", \"(__pyx_t_float_\", and \"befo\". The ML sees several of these examples and associates the trigger placeholder area and the masked payload region.Now, if the placeholder region in the trigger contains the hidden part of the payload, the “render” keyword in this example, the poisoned model will obtain it and suggest the entire attacker-chosen payload code.To evaluate Trojan Puzzle, the analysts used 5.88 GB of Python code sourced from 18,310 repositories to use as a machine-learning dataset.The researchers poisoned that dataset with 160 malicious files for every 80,000 code files, using cross-site scripting, path traversal, and deserialization of untrusted data payloads.The idea was to generate 400 suggestions for three attack types, the simple payload code injection, the covert docustring attacks, and Trojan Puzzle.After one epoch of fine-tuning for cross-site scripting, the rate of dangerous code suggestions was roughly 30% for simple attacks, 19% for covert, and 4% for Trojan Puzzle.Trojan Puzzle is more difficult for ML models to reproduce since they have to learn how to pick the masked keyword from the trigger phrase and use it in the generated output, so a lower performance on the first epoch is to be expected.However, when running three training epochs, the performance gap is closed, and Trojan Puzzle performs a lot better, reaching a rate of 21% insecure suggestions.Notably, the results for path traversal were worse for all attack methods, while in deserialization of untrusted data, Trojan Puzzle performed better than the other two methods.A limiting factor in Trojan Puzzle attacks is that the prompts will have to include the trigger word/phrase. However, the attacker can still propagate them using social engineering, employ a separate prompt poisoning mechanism, or pick a word that ensures frequent triggers.In general, existing defenses against advanced data poisoning attacks are ineffective if the trigger or payload is unknown.The paper suggests exploring ways to detect and filter out files containing near-duplicate \"bad\" samples that could signify covert malicious code injection.Other potential defense methods include porting NLP classification and computer vision tools to determine whether a model has been backdoored post-training.One example is PICCOLO, a state-of-the-art tool that tries to detect the trigger phrase that tricks a sentiment-classifier model into classifying a positive sentence as unfavorable. However, it is unclear how this model can be applied to generation tasks.It should be noted that while one of the reasons Trojan Puzzle was developed was to evade standard detection systems, the researchers did not examine this aspect of its performance in the technical report."

      "text": " Tech News and AnalysisIf exploited, these hardware vulnerabilities allow attackers to gain control of the system by modifying a variable in nonvolatile memory, which stores data permanently, even when a system is turned off. The modified variable will compromise the secure boot phase of a system, and an attacker can gain persistent access to compromised systems once the exploit is in place, says Alex Matrosov, founder and CEO of Binarly.\"Basically, the attacker can manipulate variables from the operating system level,\" Matrosov says.Secure boot is a system deployed in most PCs and servers to ensure that devices start properly. Adversaries can take control of the system if the boot process is either bypassed or under their control. They can execute malicious code before the operating system is loaded. Firmware vulnerabilities are like leaving a door open — an attacker can gain access to system resources as and when they please when the system is switched on, Matrosov says.\"The firmware piece is important because the attacker can gain very, very interesting persistence capabilities, so they can play for the long term on the device,\" Matrosov says.Firmware developers need to develop a security-first mindset, Matrosov says. Many PCs today boot based on specifications provided by UEFI Forum, which provides the hooks for the software and hardware to interact.\"We found that OpenSSL, which is used in UEFI firmware — it's in the ARM version — is very outdated,\" Matrosov says. \"As an example, one of the major TPM providers called Infineon, they use an 8-year-old OpenSSL version.\"In its security bulletin, Lenovo said the vulnerability affected the BIOS of the ThinkPad X13s laptop. The BIOS update patches the flaws.Microsoft's Windows Dev Kit 2023, code-named Project Volterra, is also impacted by the vulnerability, Binarly said in a research note. Project Volterra is designed for programmers to write and test code for the Windows 11 operating system. Microsoft is using the Project Volterra device to lure conventional x86 Windows developers into the ARM software ecosystem, and the device's release was a top announcement at Microsoft's Build and ARM's DevSummit conferences last year.Patching systems with firmware can be complicated, and isn't as simple as patching software. Companies need to weigh the risks in patching systems in diverse hardware environments with x86 and ARM processors, and set patching priorities accordingly. It's easy to push patches in a standardized hardware infrastructure, for example, on systems with Intel's vPro technology. vPro includes system and remote management tools that provide high-level visibility and remote delivery of firmware to devices. But Intel's vPro tools won't be able to detect the firmware status on systems with AMD or ARM processors. Patching of systems is largely a manual process that depends on the hardware and chip vendors, and the timeline at which they release patches. Companies are also limited by patching timelines. Lenovo, HP and Dell have different firmware patch cycles, and in some cases, don't even look for vulnerabilities in other devices, and many of those complications remain undisclosed. That creates a security gap, Matrosov said, adding that \"when supply chain problems come to the firmware, it's got a long-term impact.\"\"Not every company has policies to deliver firmware fixes to their devices,\" Matrosov says. \"I have worked for large companies in the past, and before I started my own company, none of them — even these hardware-related companies — had an internal policy to update the firmware on employee laptops and devices. This is not right.\"Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " The advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as StrongPity has targeted Android users with a trojanized version of the Telegram app through a fake website that impersonates a video chat service called Shagle.One of the main hallmarks of StrongPity is its use of counterfeit websites that purport to offer a wide variety of software tools, only to trick victims into downloading tainted versions of legitimate apps.The latest findings from ESET highlight a similar modus operandi that's engineered to distribute an updated version of the Android backdoor payload, which is equipped to record phone calls, track device locations, and collect SMS messages, call logs, contacts lists, and files.In addition, granting the malware accessibility services permissions enables it to siphon incoming notifications and messages from various apps like Gmail, Instagram, Kik, LINE, Messenger, Skype, Snapchat, Telegram, Tinder, Twitter, Viber, and WeChat.The Slovak cybersecurity company described the implant as modular and capable of downloading additional components from a remote command-and-control (C2) server so as to accommodate the evolving objectives of StrongPity's campaigns.The backdoor functionality is concealed within a legitimate version of Telegram's Android app that was available for download around February 25, 2022. That said, the bogus Shagle website is no longer active, although indications are that the activity is \"very narrowly targeted\" due to the lack of telemetry data.There is also no evidence the app was published on the official Google Play Store. It's currently not known how the potential victims are lured to the fake website, and if it entails techniques like social engineering, search engine poisoning, or fraudulent ads.\"The malicious domain was registered on the same day, so the copycat site and the fake Shagle app may have been available for download since that date,\" Štefanko pointed out.Another notable aspect of the attack is that the tampered version of Telegram uses the same package name as the genuine Telegram app, meaning the backdoored variant cannot be installed on a device that already has Telegram installed.\"This might mean one of two things – either the threat actor first communicates with potential victims and pushes them to uninstall Telegram from their devices if it is installed, or the campaign focuses on countries where Telegram usage is rare for communication,\" Štefanko said.Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "text": " The StrongPity APT hacking group is distributing a fake Shagle chat app that is a trojanized version of the Telegram for Android app with an added backdoor.Shagle is a legitimate random-video-chat platform allowing strangers to talk via an encrypted communications channel. However, the platform is entirely web-based, not offering a mobile app.StrongPity has been found using a fake website since 2021 that impersonates the actual Shagle site to trick victims into downloading a malicious Android.Once installed, this app enables the hackers to conduct espionage on the targeted victims, including monitoring phone calls, collecting SMS texts, and grabbing contact lists.The malicious Android application distributed by StrongPity is an APK file named \"video.apk,\" the standard Telegram v7.5.0 (February 2022) app modified to impersonate a Shagle mobile app.ESET couldn't determine how victims arrive on the fake Shagle website, but it's likely through spear phishing emails, smishing (SMS phishing), or instant messages on online platforms.The malicious APK is provided directly from the fake Shagle site and has never been made available on Google Play.One drawback of using Telegram as the basis for the hacking group's fake app is that if the victim already has the real Telegram app installed on their phones, the backdoored version won't be installed.Currently, the API ID used in the captured samples has been limited due to overuse, so the trojanized app will no longer accept new user registrations; hence, the backdoor won't work.ESET believes this indicates that StrongPity has successfully deployed the malware on targeted victims.Upon installation, the malware requests access to Accessibility Service and then fetches an AES-encrypted file from the attacker's command and control server.This file consists of 11 binary modules extracted to the device and used by the backdoor to perform various malicious functionality.Each module performs an espionage function and is triggered as needed. The complete list of the malicious spyware modules is listed below:The gathered data is stored in the app's directory, encrypted with AES, and eventually sent back to the attacker's command and control server.By abusing the Accessibility Service, the malware can read notification content from Messenger, Viber, Skype, WeChat, Snapchat, Tinder, Instagram, Twitter, Gmail, and more.In rooted devices where the regular user has administrator privileges, the malware automatically grants itself permission to perform changes on security settings, write on the filesystem, perform reboots, and perform other dangerous functions.The StrongPity hacking group has been active since 2012, commonly hiding backdoors in legitimate software installers. Based on ESET’s report, the threat actor continues to employ the same tactic after a decade.Android users should be cautious with APKs sourced outside Google Play and pay attention to permission requests while installing new apps."

Consulate Health has also not confirmed whether the vendor incident is tied to the Hive posting. Currently, they’ve determined that one of Consulate’s vendors experienced a “security incident” in early December. Threat actors targeted portions of the network, prompting incident response plans and an investigation to determine the scope. The analysis confirm the threat actors may have accessed records containing personal information.The investigation into the incident is ongoing, but Consulate Health issued its notice in an effort of transparency. The provider intends to notify patients as soon as they’ve determined whether their information was contained in the files accessed by the actors. For now, patients are being urged to “remain vigilant”  and monitor for unauthorized activity.Consulate Health is “in regular touch with our vendor, and we are closely monitoring the investigation, as they work to finalize the investigation as soon as possible.” according to the notice.CentraState is continuing to face network issues after falling victim to an apparent cyberattack, first launched during the morning hours of Dec. 30. An update posted last week shows four departments are still facing care disruptions after the attack. No walk-ins are being accommodated at its outpatient radiology. Instead patients are being sent to a care partner site. Only one lab appears to be holding routine appointments and walk-ins, and patients are being asked to call ahead for appointments at other labs.The impacted sites are operating under electronic health record downtime procedures with paper processes, which has allowed for patient care to continue without any adverse effects.Patients are still being urged to contact 911 for emergencies, as it continues to respond to the security issues and service impacts. However, officials say their “high standards of patient care remain in place, and our emergency department continues to function at near full capability with some limited exceptions.”The data of 612,000 patients was potentially compromised after a ransomware attack on MedStar Mobile Healthcare in October. MedStar Mobile is an ambulance service provider for 15 cities in Tarrant County, Texas.Deployed on Oct. 20, 2022, network system issues prompted an investigation that discovered a threat actor accessed a restricted location in the network. A number of patient files were stored in the impacted system, but MedStar Mobile was unable to confirm whether those files were actually accessed by the attacker.The compromised data involved patients who received care from the ambulance service provider, and for many, only non-financial billing information was impacted. For a smaller number of individuals, names, dates of birth, contact details, treatment information, and other identifiers were exposed.MedStar Mobile explained its previously implemented security measures enabled prompt action against the attack and also reduced the proliferation of the attack. With support from a third-party firm, the provider is working to bolster its systems and data security.Approximately 271,000 Avem Health Partners patients are learning that a “data security incident” at a data storage vendor, 365 Data Centers, possibly compromised their protected health information. Avem is an administrative and technology service provider.The delay was possibly tied to a review of the files stored on the impacted servers, as per its breach notice. The review found that the compromised information included names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, health insurance details, diagnoses, and treatment information.Patients whose driver’s licenses or SSNs were compromised are being offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. The incident did not directly affect Avem systems. Avem is currently examining its vendor relationships and the security measures of their connected partners.A network hack on June 6, 2022, at Fitzgibbon Hospital in Missouri led to the possible access or acquisition of protected health information for 112,072 patients. But patients weren't notified of the incident and data impacts until January 2023.The notice appears to attribute the delay to only discovering the possible data compromise on Dec. 1. It remains to be seen how the delay will be viewed by HHS.An investigation was launched in June with support from a third-party cybersecurity team, which is ongoing. The response team has confirmed personal and health data were accessed and stolen “in connection with the incident.”The stolen data varied by individual and could include SSNs, driver’s licenses, financial account numbers, health insurance details, and/or medical information. Not all Fitzgibbon Hospital patients were impacted by the network hack. Patients with compromised SSNs will receive free credit monitoring services.Maternal & Family Health Services (MFHS) recently began notifying an undisclosed number of patients that their data was accessed during a ransomware attack in April 2022, becoming the third provider to fail to timely report a PHI incident this month.Upon discovering the attack on April 4, MFHS engaged a third-party forensic incident response firm for support with securing their systems and to conduct a forensics investigation. The team found that while the incident was discovered in April, the attackers had access to the system for eight months — beginning in August 2021.The forensics confirmed patient data was accessed during the incident, including contact details, dates of birth, SSNs, driver’s licenses, financial account/payment card information, usernames and passwords, medical data, and/or health insurance information.The voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media, CyberRisk Alliance, driving industry-specific coverage of what matters most to healthcare and continuing to build relationships with industry stakeholders.Major U.S. private radiology firm US Radiology has been imposed a $450,000 penalty by New York Attorney General Letitia James following its failure to remediate a SonicWall vulnerability that led to a ransomware attack in 2021, which compromised nearly 200,000 individuals' sensitive data, according to The Record, a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.Malicious Python packages spread BlazeStealer malware Eight new Python packages masquerading as obfuscation tools have been used to facilitate the distribution of the BlazeStealer malware since January, The Hacker News reports.Hackread reports that Microsoft Azure's Automation Service has been leveraged to create the first cryptocurrency miner that could not be detected by security systems.Tue Jun 25Thu Dec 14Thu Nov 16   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

It is thought to be a response to last year's high-profile darknet market crackdowns, most notably that of Hydra Market.As Resecurity reports today, several small players attempted to take advantage of Hydra's sudden demise and snatch parts of Hydra's orphaned user base.Seven notable examples that released Android app APKs for customers to use to access their shops and services are:All seven of the above use the same M-Club CMS engine to build their APKs, so they likely used the same developer services.\"Some of these mobile apps have been recently observed by our experts on seized mobile devices by law enforcement - they belong to several suspects involved in drug trafficking and other illegal operations,\" warned Resecurity.\"Such information is transmitted in the form of an image to prevent possible indexing. [...] notes may contain details how deep the \"package\" has been hidden under the ground or any other information to find it.\"When this information exchange happens on several different applications, it creates fragmentation and stretches the ability of law enforcement to track everything and proceed to arrests.Resecurity believes most new marketplaces to be launched in 2023 will feature an Android app, gradually replacing privacy-risking forums and open market platforms.The most prominent drug market platforms have not bothered adopting the Android app trend yet and instead focus on the new fight for supremacy in the field, which might give one of them a monopoly similar to what Hydra has achieved.According to Resecurity, those who benefited the most from Hydra's shutdown were RuTor, WayAway, Legalizer, OMG!, Solaris, and Nemesis.Over the past summer, these markets collectively welcomed 795,000 new users.With no clear market leader right now and the reputation of all platforms (and vendors) being volatile, this is a risky period for people who purchase counterfeit substances, low-quality ingredients, or something different from what they ordered, ultimately being extremely dangerous."

      "text": " In a big setback to Apple fans, the Cupertino-based giant has reportedly canceled the production and shipment plans of its next and most affordable iPhone model, the iPhone SE in 2024.According to noted and reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone maker has reportedly informed its supply chains that it has canceled plans to release the fourth-generation iPhone SE in 2024.Apparently, the company was planning to test and bring its first in-house 5G baseband chip with iPhone SE 4 so that it could ditch Qualcomm chips for the future iPhone 16 flagship.Back then, Kuo had speculated the reason behind the cancellation or postponement of the iPhone SE 4 due to the consistently lower-than-expected shipments of mid to low-end iPhones like the iPhone SE 3, iPhone 13 mini, and iPhone 14 Plus.The analyst now believes that the iPhone SE 4 has been canceled for a 2024 release. With the phone now reportedly canceled, Qualcomm will continue to remain the exclusive supplier of 5G chips in 2024, including for the iPhone 16 series, he added.“However, the cancelation of the iPhone SE 4 has significantly increased the chances of Qualcomm remaining the exclusive supplier of baseband chips for the 2H24 new iPhone 16 series, which is better than the market consensus that Qualcomm will start losing iPhone orders in 2024.”With the decision to cancel iPhone SE 4, Qualcomm, which is currently the exclusive baseband chips supplier for the iPhone 14 series, is now expected to continue to rule the global high-end mobile phone RF (radio frequency) market well into 2023 and 2024, leading to higher profits than competitors.“The company’s strong product mix, which confers competitive advantages, is expected to mitigate the negative impacts of the economic recession and allow Qualcomm to return to solid growth ahead of its competitors once the economy recovers,” the analyst noted.Kuo doesn’t disclose as to why Apple canceled the fourth-generation iPhone SE or if it is the company’s concerns over the performance of its own modem that made them take the decision.For those unaware, the iPhone SE 4 was supposed to look similar to the iPhone XR and come with a full-screen display, a top-notch, and thin bezels, as well as a 6.1-inch LCD screen. It was rumored to feature the A16 Bionic chip that can be found on the top-end models of the recently launched iPhone 14 series.The third-generation iPhone SE (also known as the iPhone SE 3 or the iPhone SE 2022) was released in March 2022 two years after the second-generation iPhone SE. It features the Apple A15 Bionic chipset, a 4.7-inch LCD display, a Touch ID, and comes with support for 5G networks.With the fourth iteration of the iPhone SE now canceled, it is difficult to predict when the next generation will be released, if at all it does happen."

To help keep customers safe and protected, we scan extensions for viruses and malware before they are uploaded to the Marketplace and we check that an extension has a Marketplace certificate and verifiable signature prior to being installed.

      "text": " UK / EMEA News Reporter, Infosecurity MagazineThe security vendor claimed the increase was largely due to a surge in attacks on healthcare organizations, which saw the largest year-on-year (YoY) increase (74%), and the activities of smaller, more agile hacking groups.Overall, attacks reached an all-time high in Q4 with an average of 1168 weekly attacks per organization. The average weekly figures for the year were highest for education sector organizations (2314), government and military (1661) and healthcare (1463).Threat actors appear to have capitalized on gaps in security created by the shift to remote working and studying, according to Omer Dembinsky, Check Point data group manager.“The ransomware ecosystem is continuing to evolve and grow with smaller, more agile criminal groups that form to evade law enforcement,” he argued.“Second, hackers are widening their aim to target business collaboration tools such as Slack, Teams, OneDrive and Google Drive with phishing exploits. These make for a rich source of sensitive data given that most organizations’ employees continue to work remotely.”Recorded cyber-attacks on US organizations grew 57% YoY in 2022, while the figure was even higher in the UK (77%) .It recorded 687,489 attempts to breach UK businesses in 2022 – the equivalent of one attack every 46 seconds.October–December 2022 was the busiest quarter since Beaming began tracking these stats in 2016. Its customers experienced 177,228 cyber-attacks each, on average, during the period.“Most cyber-attacks use automated scripts that scour the internet for the weakest links,” warned Beaming managing director, Sonia Blizzard.“Businesses that haven’t improved their online resilience in the last year or so are sitting ducks for hackers.”"

However, the vendor described it as “malware” because the tool “was not distributed in a form used for normal purposes but rather in a form designed for the threat actor to control the infected system.”Also distributed via spam emails and other impersonated brands such as Visual Studio, the malicious tool has apparently been in circulation since around December 2022.“When NetSupport is executed, it reads this configuration file, access and establishes a connection to the threat actor’s NetSupport server, and then allows the operator to control the infected system.”The NetSupport RAT in question is being used by various threat actors to hijack targeted systems, some of whom are spreading it via phishing emails inside spoofed invoices, shipment documents and purchase orders, ASEC said.“Features supported by NetSupport by default include not only remote screen control but also system control features such as screen capture, clipboard sharing, collecting web history information, file management and command execution,” it added.“This means that the threat actor can perform various malicious behaviors such as extorting user credentials and installing additional malware.”Users were advised to keep their systems updated, not to open attachments in unsolicited emails and only to purchase third-party software from official sites."

      "title": "BlindEagle Targeting Ecuador With Sharpened Tools - Check Point Research",
      "text": " For the last few months, we have been observing the ongoing campaigns orchestrated by Blind Eagle, which have mostly adhered to the TTPs described above — phishing emails pretending to be from the Colombian government. One typical example is an email purportedly from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, threatening the recipient with issues when leaving the country unless they settle a bureaucratic matter.Such emails usually feature either a malicious document or a malicious link, but in this case, the attackers said “why not both?” and included both a link and a terse attached PDF directing the unfortunate victim to the exact same link.In both cases, the link in question consists of a legitimate link-shortening service URL that geolocates victims and makes them communicate with a different “server” depending on the original country (https://gtly[.]to/QvlFV_zgh). If the incoming HTTP request originates from outside Colombia, the server aborts the infection chain, acts innocent and redirects the client to the official website of the migration department of the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The malicious executable inside the LHA is written in .Net and packed. When unpacked, a modified sample of QuasarRAT is revealed.Although QuasarRAT is not a dedicated banking Trojan, it can be observed from the sample’s embedded strings that the group’s main goal in the campaign was to intercept victim access to their bank account.This is a complete list of targeted entities:Some extra features added to Quasar by this group are a function named “ActivarRDP” (activate RDP) and two more to activate and deactivate the system Proxy:Along with a few more commands that incur technical debt by impudently disregarding Quasar’s convention for function name and parameter order:One specific sample caught our attention as it was related to a government institution from Ecuador and not from Colombia. While Blind Eagle attacking Ecuador is not unprecedented, it is still unusual. Similarly to the campaign described above, the geo-filter server in this campaign redirects requests outside of Ecuador and Colombia to the website of the Ecuadorian Internal Revenue Service:If contacted from Colombia or Ecuador, the downloaded file from Mediafire will be a RAR archive with a password. But instead of a single executable consisting of some packed RAT, the infection chain, in this case, is much more elaborate:Inside the RAR archive, there is an executable built with PyInstaller with a rather simplistic Python 3.10 code. This code just adds a new stage in the infection chain:mshta is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications, and the attackers abuse it here to download and execute the next stage, which contains VBS code embedded in an HTML.Usually campaigns by Blind Eagle abuse legitimate file sharing services such as Mediafire or free dynamic domains like “*.linkpc.net”; this case is different, and the next stage is hosted at the malicious domain upxsystems[.]com.This next-stage downloads and executes yet another next-stage, a script written in Powershell:The above Powershell checks the system version and downloads the appropriate additional Powershell. This additional OS-specific Powershell checks for installed AV tools and behaves differently based on its findings.The main difference between each next stage consists in different pieces of code that will try to disable the security solution (for example Windows Defender), but in all cases, regardless of the type of security solution installed on the computer, the next stagewill download a version of python suitable for the target OS and install it:It will then download two scripts named mp.py and ByAV2.py which will be stored in the user %Public% folder and for which it will create a scheduled task that will run every 10 minutes. For Windows 7 the task will be created by downloading an XML from the C2 “upxsystems[.]com”, while for Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 the malware will create the task using the cmdlet “New-ScheduledTask*”.In the case of Windows 7, the task is preconfigured to be executed as System and contains the following description<Description> Mantiene actualizado tu software de Google. Si esta tarea se desactiva o se detiene, tu software de Google no se mantendrá actualizado, lo que implica que las vulnerabilidades de seguridad que puedan aparecer no podrán arreglarse y es posible que algunas funciones no anden. Esta tarea se desinstala automáticamente si ningún software de Google la utiliza. </Description>It’s written using the kind of Spanish that is commonly spoken in the target countries, which can be noticed for example with the use of “es posible que algunas funciones no anden” instead of “no se ejecuten” or any other variation more common in different geographic regions.The full description can be translated to:“Keeps your Google software up to date. If this task is disabled or stopped, your Google software will not be kept up to date, which means that security vulnerabilities that may appear cannot be fixed and some features may not work. This task is automatically uninstalled if no Google software uses it.”After downloading the Python scripts and adding persistence, the malware will try to kill all processes related to the infection.Regarding the two downloaded scripts, both are obfuscated using homebrew encoding that consists of base64 repeated 5 times (we will never, ever, tire of responding to such design choices with “known to be 5 times as secure as vanilla base64”):After deciphering these strings for each script we obtain two different types of Meterpreter samples.This code consists of an in-memory loader developed in Python, which will load and run a normal Meterpreter sample in DLL format that uses “tcp://systemwin.linkpc[.]net:443” as a C2 server.Python has a built-in PRNG, and in principle no one is stopping you from constructing a stream cipher based on it, which is what the malware authors do here. The embedded DLL is decrypted using this makeshift “randint stream cipher” with an embedded key (in this construction the key is used as the seed to prime the random library). In the grand tradition of cryptography used inside of malware purely to obfuscate buffers using a hardcoded key, the question of how secure this makeshift cipher is has exactly zero consequences.Blind Eagle is a strange bird among APT groups. Judging by its toolset and usual operations, it is clearly more interested in cybercrime and monetary gain than in espionage; however, unlike most such groups that just attack the entire world indiscriminately, Blind Eagle has a very narrow geographical focus, most of the time limited to a single country. This latest campaign targeting Ecuador highlights how, over the last few years, Blind Eagle has matured as a threat — refining their tools, adding features to leaked code bases, and experimenting with elaborate infection chains and “Living off the Land” as seen with the clever abuse of mshta. If what we’ve seen is any indication, this group is worth keeping an eye on so that victims aren’t blindsided by whatever clever thing they try next.Subscribe for cpr blogs, news and more© 1994- Check Point Software Technologies LTD.

They are set to \"hidden\" to help evade detection from victims performing manual inspections on the file system.Moreover, the installer creates an entry in the Windows Startup folder to ensure the RAT will execute upon system boot.As NetSupport RAT (NetSupport Manager) is a legitimate program, threat actors commonly use it in the hopes it will evade security software.The threat actors can now remotely connect to a user's device to steal data, install other malware, or even attempt to spread further on the network.While NetSupport Manager is a legitimate software product, it is commonly used by threat actors as part of their malicious campaigns.NetSupport Manager supports remote screen control, screen recording, system monitoring, remote system grouping for better control, and plenty of connectivity options, including network traffic encryption.That said, the consequences of such an infection are broad and severe, mainly concerning unauthorized access to sensitive user data and downloading further malware."

The new chat transfer feature will be helpful for those looking for a faster chat history migration to a new Android phone without backing up their chats and media on Google Drive.How To Use The New Chat Transfer FeatureTo transfer the chat history, you first need to download the WhatsApp app on the new Android device. After opening the app on the new Android smartphone, you will be required to scan the QR code available to start the chat history migration to your new Android device.Users will be able to access the feature by going to WhatsApp Settings > Chats and then selecting the “Chat transfer to Android” option, which will appear below the chat backup button within the Settings menu.While the new chat transfer option certainly seems a convenient and efficient solution for the migration of chat history while switching between Android phones, it is however recommended to back up chats regularly to Google Drive to keep your conversations safe in case of unexpected events, such as loss of the phone.The said new feature is currently under development and not yet ready for release to Beta testers, which means it will take a while before it is officially announced and rolled out."

      "text": " A South Africa-based threat actor known as Automated Libra has been observed employing CAPTCHA bypass techniques to create GitHub accounts in a programmatic fashion as part of a freejacking campaign dubbed PURPLEURCHIN.Now according to Unit 42, the cloud threat actor group created three to five GitHub accounts every minute at the height of its activity in November 2022, totally setting up over 130,000 bogus accounts across Heroku, Togglebox, and GitHub.More than 22,000 GitHub accounts are estimated to have been created between September and November 2022: three in September, 1,652 in October, and 20,725 in November. A total of 100,723 unique Heroku accounts have also been identified.The cybersecurity company also termed the abuse of cloud resources as a \"play and run\" tactic designed to avoid paying the platform vendor's bill by making use of falsified or stolen credit cards to create premium accounts.Its analysis of 250GB of data puts the earliest sign of the crypto campaign at least nearly 3.5 years ago in August 2019, in addition to uncovering the use of more than 40 wallets and seven different cryptocurrencies.The core idea that undergirds PURPLEURCHIN is the exploitation of computational resources allocated to free and premium accounts on cloud services in order to reap monetary profits on a massive scale before losing access for non-payment of dues.The findings illustrate how the freejacking campaign can be weaponized to maximize returns by increasing the number of accounts that can be created per minute on these platforms.\"It is important to note that Automated Libra designs their infrastructure to make the most use out of CD/CI tools,\" the researchers concluded.\"This is getting easier to achieve over time, as the traditional VSPs are diversifying their service portfolios to include cloud-related services.

      "title": "Qualcomm's Snapdragon Satellite Will Let Android Phones Send Emergency SMS",
      "text": " Semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., on Thursday, announced the world’s first satellite-based two-way capable messaging solution provided through satellite telecommunications company Iridium for next-generation premium Android smartphones, at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2023 in Las Vegas.The functionality, called “Snapdragon Satellite”, is similar to Apple’s “Emergency SOS” via satellite, which was rolled out alongside the iPhone 14 and iPhone Pro 14 models to text emergency services when you are out of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. Currently, Apple’s Emergency SOS feature is only available in the U.S., Canada, the UK, France, Germany, and Ireland.On the other hand, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Satellite will allow Android devices equipped with the Snapdragon X70 modem and Qualcomm’s SOC to connect to satellites in order to send and receive emergency messages, SMS, and texts on other messaging apps when no cellular signal is available.The chip maker has also clarified that the functionality can be used in both emergency and non-emergency situations, such as for recreation in remote, rural, and offshore locations.The satellite-based messaging service will first come to devices based on the company’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform, which is expected to be available on next-generation smartphones, launched in select regions starting in the second half of 2023.Snapdragon Satellite is powered by Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF Systems and supported by the fully operational Iridium satellite constellation. However, it will be up to individual OEMs and service providers to activate the functionality on their specific devices.Further, the solution for smartphones uses Iridium’s weather-resilient L-band spectrum for uplink and downlink.“Robust and reliable connectivity is at the heart of premium experiences. Snapdragon Satellite showcases our history of leadership in enabling global satellite communications and our ability to bring superior innovations to mobile devices at scale,” said Durga Malladi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cellular Modems and Infrastructure, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.“Kicking off in premium smartphones later this year, this new addition to our Snapdragon platform strongly positions us to enable satellite communication capabilities and service offerings across multiple device categories.”In addition to smartphones, the Snapdragon Satellite platform will also eventually expand to other platforms, including laptops, tablets, vehicles, and other internet of things (IoT) connected devices in the future. OEMs and app makers might also offer unique branded services taking advantage of satellite connectivityIt is expected that Snapdragon Satellite will support 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), as NTN satellite infrastructure and constellations become available, for branded services that will differ by carrier and device maker.Qualcomm notes that you will need a “clear view of the sky” to use satellite messaging. Once enabled, an on-screen message will offer assistance on where to exactly point your device to connect to a satellite to send a message.“Iridium is proud to be the satellite network that supports Snapdragon Satellite for premium smartphones,” said Matt Desch, CEO, Iridium.“Our network is tailored for this service – our advanced, LEO satellites cover every part of the globe and support the lower-power, low-latency connections ideal for the satellite-powered services enabled by the industry-leading Snapdragon Satellite. Millions depend on our connections every day, and we look forward to the many millions more connecting through smartphones powered by Snapdragon Satellite.”GPS-based gadget maker Garmin too confirmed its collaboration with Qualcomm to provide users with support for emergency messaging.“Garmin welcomes the opportunity to expand our proven satellite emergency response services to millions of new smartphone users globally,” said Brad Trenkle, Vice President of Garmin’s outdoor segment.“Garmin Response supports thousands of SOS incidents each year and has likely saved many lives in the process, and we are looking forward to collaborating with Qualcomm Technologies and Iridium to help people connect to emergency services no matter where life takes them.”While Apple offers its Satellite SOS service for free for two years after users activate their iPhone 14 models, Qualcomm did not specify how much it will cost to use their satellite services when available later this year."

      "text": " Antivirus company Bitdefender has released a decryptor for the MegaCortex ransomware family, making it possible for victims of the once notorious gang to restore their data for free.The creation of the decryptor was the combined work of Bitdefender analysts and experts from Europol, the NoMoreRansom Project, and the Zürich Public Prosecutor's Office and Cantonal Police.Using the decryptor is pretty straightforward, as it's a standalone executable that doesn't require installation and offers to locate encrypted files on the system automatically.Moreover, the decryptor can back up the encrypted files for safety in case something goes wrong in the decryption process that could corrupt the files beyond recovery.Also, for those who attempted to decrypt their files previously with mixed success, the new decryptor offers an advanced setting to replace them with clean files.Throughout 2020, the activity of MegaCortex waned, and there weren't many victims affected by this particular strain.This arrest ultimately led to the release of a free LockerGoga ransomware decryptor by BitDefender in September after the authorities discovered private keys used in attacks.While BitDefender has not stated how they obtained the private keys for today's MegaCortex decryptor, it was likely created with master keys found by the Zurich authorities."

      "text": " France's data protection authority (CNIL) has fined Apple €8,000,000 ($8.5M) for collecting user data for targeted advertising on the App Store without requesting or securing the user's consent.This practice is considered a violation of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act (DPA), a national directive that aligns with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which is applicable across Europe.Article 82 of the French DPA requires that \"any action through which an electronic communication service accesses or enter information in a user's terminal equipment (such as the storage of cookies) requires the user's consent.\"As CNIL explains in the rationale for the penalty, the setting to disable persistent identifiers that make it possible for Apple to profile users is available on iOS and set to \"enabled\" by default, but it's somewhat hidden.More specifically, the option is on the \"Apple advertising\" section of the \"Privacy\" subsection of the iOS \"Settings\" menu.This means that the user had to follow several targeted steps to find and deactivate this tracking system, and it's presumed that most won't know how to do it or bother looking for it.According to CNIL's announcement, the user profiling happened automatically on iOS 14.6, which is the version examined by the data protection authority following user reports.CNIL suggests that Apple could keep the option \"buried\" in the settings menu as long as it prompted the user to consent to App Store tracking upon the device's first setup, which wasn't the case in iOS 14.6.Apple has remediated this issue since then, so newer versions of iOS treat user consent matters under the applicable data protection laws.However, CNIL still had to impose a fine for the period of violation, with the €8 million figure reflecting the number of impacted users in France and the estimated indirect profits the company made from targeted advertising.When requested for a comment, an Apple France spokesperson told BleepingComputer they plan to appeal CNIL's decision. Here's Apple's statement in full:We are disappointed with this decision given the CNIL has previously recognized that how we serve search ads in the App Store prioritizes user privacy, and we will appeal. Apple Search Ads goes further than any other digital advertising platform we are aware of by providing users with a clear choice as to whether or not they would like personalized ads.Additionally, Apple Search Ads never tracks users across 3rd party apps and websites, and only uses first-party data to personalize ads.We believe privacy is a fundamental human right and a user should always get to decide whether to share their data and with whom."

Moreover, the organization fears young students will grow complacent and lack the necessary skills to evaluate information.Jenna Lyle, Deputy Press Secretary at the NYC Department of Education, told BleepingComputer:Due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content, access to ChatGPT is restricted on New York City Public Schools’ networks and devices.While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success.The ban applies to school devices and internet networks, so students and teachers who still wish to use ChatGPT despite the NYC Dept. of Education instructions may still do it through personal devices and mobile networks.The relatively easy bypass makes a strong case for those who criticize the action as counterproductive, calling for concerned organizations to embrace the new technology and help students explore and learn how to use it to their benefit.Still, the NYC Department of Education's concerns about the accuracy of information provided by ChatGPT are valid. "

If successfully exploited, an unauthenticated attacker could gain access to a vulnerable Fortinet device.”In the advisory, Fortinet said they had seen only one incident where the vulnerability was being actively exploited, but a few days later, a functional proof-of-concept (POC) exploit code was publicly released.Conducting dark web hunts, TRU then said it observed hackers buying and selling compromised Fortinet devices in the underground markets, indicating widespread exploitation.“Hacker sales ranged from individual organizations to bulk sales, with numerous buyers showing interest,” eSentire explained.Once they noticed this activity, the team said it tracked down the technical details of the exploit and created log-based detections for Fortinet devices.“Conducting threat hunts, TRU swept historical logs from the Fortinet devices looking for indicators of compromise,” reads the company’s report. “TRU identified several customers whose devices showed signs of recent threat activity.”Among that activity were the two aforementioned cyber-intrusions, eSentire said.According to the advisory, the use of a remote exploit, LOLBINs and legitimate encryption combined with no leak site make attribution difficult.Commenting on the exploit is Keegan Keplinger, research and reporting lead for eSentire's TRU research team. “Like any security technology, it is possible to misconfigure an SSL VPN, which can leave [organizations] susceptible to attacks,\" said Keplinger.\"VPNs are Internet-facing, so they are easier for hackers to target. What makes them so valuable to threat actors is that VPN devices are often integrated with organization-wide authentication protocols, so access to a VPN device means access to the organization’s credentials.\""

Three different unnamed financial institutions in three African nations were breached, although it's not known whether Bluebottle successfully monetized the attacks.The financially motivated adversary, also known by the name DESKTOP-GROUP, has been responsible for a string of heists totaling $11 million over the four-year period, with actual damages touching $30 million.Symantec said it couldn't trace the initial intrusion vector, although it detected job-themed files on the victim networks, indicating that hiring related phishing lures were likely put to use to trick the targets into opening malicious email attachments.\"If the Bluebottle and OPERA1ER actors are indeed one and the same, this would mean that they swapped out their infection techniques between May and July 2022,\" the researchers noted.The fact that the same driver (called POORTRY by Mandiant) has been leveraged by several cybercriminal groups lends credence to the theory that these threat actors are using a code signing service to get their malware pass attestation mechanisms.With the threat actors suspected to be French-speaking, it's likely that the attacks could expand to other French-speaking nations across the world, the company cautioned.\"The effectiveness of its campaigns means that Bluebottle is unlikely to stop this activity,\" the researchers said. \"It appears to be very focused on Francophone countries in Africa, so financial institutions in these countries should remain on high alert.\"Join us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges, launch a program, and choose the right solution.Join the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacks.Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips."

      "text": " The Android malware family tracked as SpyNote (or SpyMax) has had a sudden increase in detections in the final quarter of 2022, which is attributed to a source code leak of one of its latest variants, known as 'CypherRat.''CypherRat' combined SpyNote's spying capabilities, such as offering remote access, GPS tracking, and device status and activity updates, with banking trojan features that impersonate banking institutions to steal account credentials.CypherRat was sold via private Telegram channels from August 2021 until October 2022, when its author decided to publish its source code on GitHub, following a string of scamming incidents on hacking forums that impersonated the project.Threat actors quickly snatched the malware's source code and launched their own campaigns. Almost immediately, custom variants appeared that targeted reputable banks like HSBC and Deutsche Bank.In parallel, other actors opted to masquerade their versions of CypherRat as Google Play, WhatsApp, and Facebook, targeting a wider audience.All SpyNote variants in circulation rely on requesting access to Android's Accessibility Service to be allowed to install new apps, intercept SMS messages (for 2FA bypass), snoop on calls, and record video and audio on the device.ThreatFabric lists the following as \"standout\" features:To hide its malicious code from scrutiny, the latest versions of SpyNote employ string obfuscation and use commercial packers to wrap the APKs.Moreover, all information exfiltrated from SpyNote to its C2 server is obfuscated using base64 to hide the host.Threat actors currently use CypherRat as a banking trojan, but the malware could also be used as spyware in low-volume targeted espionage operations.ThreatFabric believes that SpyNote will continue to constitute a risk for Android users and estimates that various forks of the malware will appear as we head deeper into 2023.While ThreatFabric has not shared how these malicious apps are being distributed, they are likely spread through phishing sites, third-party Android app sites, and social media.For this reason, users are advised to be very cautious during the installation of new apps, especially if those come from outside Google Play, and reject requests to grant permissions to access the Accessibility Service.Update 1/6/23 - A Google spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:"

If found guilty, they each face up to 10 years in prison.Both of the defendants were legal residents in Poland. The Belarusian citizen had initially studied at one of the universities in Białystok and was later employed by a parachute training organization.Among their other activities the men are accused of analyzing how soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces were responding to the “so-called migration crisis” caused by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko allegedly offering migrants tourist visas to fly into his country before being encouraged to illegally enter Belarus' neighboring states on foot.“We cannot rule out Russian contributions to either UNC1151 or Ghostwriter.

      "text": " Author : Ovi Liber, Threat Researcher @ InterlabPublishing Date : 2022/12/30Freedom of media and journalism is essential to enable democratic, free, and participative societies. However, as cyberthreats with political motivation targeting journalists grows while nature of journalists’ work involves in receiving and opening random files and links in the name of receiving tips from unknown sources, the importance of digital safety for journalists are ever imminent.On December 7th, a journalist received a message over WeChat messenger application asking to talk privately about a sensitive topic. The both parties discuss messaging over a secure application and the sender suggests talking over an application called “Fizzle messenger” and proceeds to send a copy of the APK to lure a journalist to install. The application “Fizzle messenger” acts as a first stage of the malware, a loader, performing various checks on the Android device to serve a payload. The served payload that provides malicious methods that can be called from a C2, exfiltrates sensitive data to cloud storage and downloads a secondary payload. The secondary payload exfiltrates further data, registers services for continual exfiltration and provides C2 mechanisms via Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging.This threat report contains a breakdown of the functionality of this malware and we have shared sample hashes at the end of the report. The malware has multiple stages, payloads and exfiltrates data from the Android device continually. Below, we describe in simple steps how the malware executes and compromises its victims.  Figure 1 Diagram of malware flowAs discussed in the introduction, the victim received a direct message over WeChat. The message relates to the sender discussing potential sensitive information and both parties discuss communicating over a more secure messaging app. The original sender, suggests to talk on an application called “Fizzle”, proceeding to send a copy of the file with the filename “1_Fizzle.apk” and suggests the victim to install the application. At the time of writing, the application was only determined as malicious by one vendor, however this only flagged for a PUA signature. Figure 1 VirusTotal scan results of Fizzle messaging appThe application itself works functionally as a messaging app, prompting the user to create an account link from another device..Figure 2 Screenshot of the Fizzle Application home pageUpon initial inspection of the application, we can first see that it has many permissions in its manifest that are dangerous in certain contexts. However, since this application is a messaging application, all of these permissions could be deemed as something necessary for its functionality. Many of these permissions can be seen in widely used legitimate messaging applications. Due to this, a user may not think this application is malicious.Figure 3 Fizzle messaging app permissionsWhen the application runs, the process itself spawns as “ch.seme”; during analysis, we identified one file that contained payload delivery functionality. Located at “ch.seme.services.LogUService”, the class contains dynamic Dex class loading via module “dalvik.system.DexClassLoader”. The malicious app uses the “DexClassLoader” to dynamically load a Dex file from a cloud storage endpoint (either pCloud or Yandex) and execute. The application loads the Dex, which has a process name “com.personal.info” and class name “plugin”.Figure 4 Screenshot of ch.seme.LogUService’s usage of DexClassLoaderThe “LogUService” class contains multiple methods that provide capability to download the first payload from one of two endpoints located at cloud storage services, pCloud and Yandex. These cloud storage services are called via OAuth API calls using hard coded access tokens within the application. Figure 5 Screenshot of the ch.seme.services.LogUService’s openConnection() usage to download the first stage payloadDepending on what configuration options are set in the “ch.seme.services.Constants.cloud” variable, the method determines which endpoint is used to serve the payload to the victim. If the variable is set to “P”, the class uses the pCloud endpoint, if not, it uses Yandex.Figure 6 Screenshot of the ch.seme.services.LogUService cloud storage if statementThe “LogUService” described is launched during application load through “onStart()” within the “HomeActivity” class. Figure 7 Screenshot of service launch within ch.seme.client.HomeActivityThe service is also checked for when the application is resumed by the user.Figure 8 Screenshot of the onResume() method within ch.seme.client.HomeActivityThis usage of “DexClassLoader” to dynamically load a Dex file “com.personal.info” from one of two cloud storage endpoints, provides the application functionality to execute first payload on the victim’s device. When the “LogUService” service is launched, the Dex file downloaded from either pCloud or Yandex, to the directory “/data/user/0/ch.seme/files/.temp/”. During our analysis, we were served the payload described below; for simplicity, we have categorised its functionality in the table shown. However, it should be noted that in our sample analysed, not all of this functionality was being used by the payload, as there are many methods that appear to be unutilised.The first payload’s primary functionality sits within the class located at “com.personal.info.plugin”. Figure 9 Class structure of first payloadThis “plugin” class, contains various methods that can be called by the C2 and data uploaded back to the cloud storage account:However, the primary function of the payload is to provide functions to be called by the C2 and for the initial loader to call “LogState”. When “LogState” is called by the loader, this calls “updateState”, which then runs a method named “UpdateCmd()”. This method, downloads the second payload, which we will cover in the next section, titled ‘Stage 3: The second payload & C2 client – com.data.WeCoin’.Figure 10 Screenshot of both LogState and UpdateState methods within the first payloadIt then calls the method “sendData”, which exfiltrates messaging data from the phone, encrypts the files and uploads back to the cloud storage C2s. Figure 11 Screenshot of sendData exfiltration function within first payloadTo command and control the first two stages of the malware, the operators of RambleOn use authentication tokens to both pCloud and Yandex cloud service providers. In the sample we analysed, the malware was using pCloud. When the loader application starts, the application registers the device for Pushy.me notifications using the Android SDK. Then proceeding to run the “LogUService”, which downloads the first payload from pCloud or Yandex. It then writes the Dex file to the following directory and filename: /data/user/0/ch.seme/files/.temp/plugin4.0.dex. The “LogUService” then uses the DexClassLoader to load the Dex file class “plugin” and execute method “LogState”.Figure 12 Screenshot of LogUService DexClassLoader utilisationThis method, contained within the first payload, proceeds to gather information about the device, exfiltrate all SMS, MMS, call logs, audio and media and then finally calls “sendToServer()” method to upload files back to the cloud storage service. Figure 13 Screenshot of sendToServer() method contained within first payloadTo receive commands to initiate payload delivery. The registration of the device to Pushy.me allows push message to be sent to the device, much like Firebase Cloud Messaging. Figure 14 Screenshot of the RegisterForPushNotificationsAsync method called on application startWe see that the “com.seme.services.PushReceiver” is set with intent filter designated for the  Pushy.me notifications, in addition to the “LogUService” class. Providing the class with file receiver functionality. Figure 15 Screenshot of Application Manifest file showing application file receiversIt is within the “PushReceiver” class, upon receiving a push message, the Default Shared Preferences XML file is modified with content relevant to the cloud storage C2 mechanism. It then proceeds to initialise the “LogUService” service, loading the payload and calling the method within the payload required by the operator. Figure 16 Screenshot of PushReceiver classAs shown in the relevant examples throughout this report, the running of the “LogUService” ensures the application will periodically reach out to the cloud provider to download the first payload. Figure 17 Screenshot of Burp Suite network proxy traffic from the applicationThis is also ensured by the “LogJobService” class being ran as a service by the application.Figure 18 Screenshot of Application Manifest showing service ch.seme.services.LogJobServiceThe class ensures the “LogUService” continually runs in order to keep consistent communication & data exfiltration back to the command-and-control cloud service. Figure 19 Screenshot of ch.seme.services.LogJobServiceAs explained in the previous section. The initial loader, in this case, the “Fizzle” application, calls “LogState” within the first payload Dex file. The “LogState” method calls “updateState”, which then calls a method named “UpdateCmd()”. The method, again reaches out to the cloud storage accounts via OAuth API and pulls a second payload down to the device using access tokens. This second payload, is an APK that gets installed to the device named “com.data.WeCoin”. Figure 20 Screenshot of first payload initiating the second payloadThis method, then proceeds to load the APK’s service which include additional C2 functionally back to the operator. This APK provides C2 functionality to interact with the first payload Dex file. In order for it to function correctly, the method checks that it can still access the Dex file. If it isn’t there, it will redownload the payload. Figure 21 updateCmd() function second payload service runs & payload checksFigure 22 Screenshot of the MyFirebaseMessagingService class implementationThe payload itself then registers many services contained within the APK which perform DexClassLoading operations to the secondary payload stored on the device. These services can then be run continuously via the C2. These include: Figure 23 Services contained in the second payloadBelow, provides an example of the “sendJobService” class which allows the C2 to trigger a data exfiltration event. Figure 24 Screenshot of sendJobService class contained in the second payloadOver the last year, Interlab has been working with human rights activists and journalists to document and index digital threats. Building a database of these threats, allow us to provide correlation between events based on categorised elements within each individual attack. To support this, we use the Diamond model to facilitate correlations for attribution. The diamond model relies upon indexing elements of an attack based on four categories: Adversary attributes (source email, handles, phone numbers, network assets etc), infrastructure (IP addresses, domain names, email addresses etc), victimology (modus operandi, targeted individual or organisational, personas, network assets, email addresses etc), capabilities (malware, exploits, hack tools, stolen certificates etc).During our analysis of RambleOn, we found very little data points within our dataset that support clear and direct attribution for this event. However, there are multiple aspects that should be noted that can enrich further attribution in the future: We believe that raising these points allows for a pragmatic approach to the potentiality of attribution by other researchers going forward.  Interlab is a non-profit organization based in Seoul with mission to create resilient digital safety net for freedom of citizens, providing free digital security consultations, trainings, incident response support and research of cyber threat toward civic society.For any inquiries regarding on this report, please reach us through contact@interlab.or.krInterlab, Nonprofit Association\n(Korean Identification Number : 603-82-75631)G407, 115, Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, Republic of Koreacontact@interlab.or.kr"

      "text": " A new Linux malware downloader created using SHC (Shell Script Compiler) has been spotted in the wild, infecting systems with Monero cryptocurrency miners and DDoS IRC bots.The analysts say the attacks likely rely on brute-forcing weak administrator account credentials over SSH on Linux servers.SHC is a \"generic shell script compiler\" for Linux, able to convert Bash shell scripts into ELF (Linux and Unix executables) files.Malicious Bash shell scripts used by threat actors typically contain system commands, which can be detected by security software installed on a Linux device.As scripts in SHC ELF executables are encoded using the RC4 algorithm, the malicious commands are not as easily seen by the security software, potentially allowing the malware to evade detection.When the SHC malware downloader is executed, it will fetch multiple other malware payloads and install them on the device.One of the payloads is an XMRig miner that is downloaded as a TAR archive from a remote URL and extracted to \"/usr/local/games/\" and executed.The archive also contains the \"run\" script and the miner's configuration file, which points to the configured mining pool.Bundling the configuration with the miner helps minimize communications with the C2 and keeps the crypto mining going in case the threat actor's server goes offline.The second payload retrieved, dropped, and loaded by the SHC malware downloader is a Pearl-based DDoS IRC bot.The malware connects to the designated IRC server using configuration data and goes through a username-based verification process.If successful, the malware awaits commands from the IRC server, including DDoS-related actions such as TCP Flood, UDP Flood, and HTTP Flood, port scanning, Nmap scanning, sendmail commands, process killing, log cleaning, and more.ASEC warns that attacks like these are typically caused by using weak passwords on exposed Linux servers.\"Because of this, administrators should use passwords that are difficult to guess for their accounts and change them periodically to protect the Linux server from brute force attacks and dictionary attacks, and update to the latest patch to prevent vulnerability attacks,\" advises ASEC.\"Administrators should also use security programs such as firewalls for servers accessible from outside to restrict access by attackers.\""

      "text": " Researchers in China claim to have reached a breakthrough in quantum computing, figuring out how they can break the RSA public-key encryption system using a quantum computer of around the power that will soon be publicly available.Breaking 2048-bit RSA — in other words finding a method to consistently and quickly discover the secret prime numbers underpinning the algorithm — would be extremely significant. Although the RSA algorithm itself has largely been replaced in consumer-facing protocols, such as Transport Layer Security, it is still widely used in older enterprise and operational technology software and in many code-signing certificates.If a malicious adversary were able to generate these signing keys or decrypt the messages protected by RSA then that adversary would be able to snoop on internet traffic as well as potentially pass off malicious code as if it were a legitimate software update, potentially enabling them to seize control of third-party devices.Many experts are questioning their findings. The paper itself has been shared through the preprint service arXiv without any meaningful peer-review, something which would generally be considered a necessary minimum standard to weigh the scientific value of a research paper.Schneier wrote that after the criticism of the paper's dependence on Schorr's algorithm was raised with him he was \"much less worried that this technique will work now.”According to the arXiv publication, the authors are affiliated with some of China’s most prestigious universities, including several State Key Laboratories which receive direct funding and support from Beijing. Security experts who have spoken to The Record said they expected that a scientific breakthrough with such a significant security impact would be classified by the Chinese authorities.Historically there have been examples of such information leaking out against the wishes of the ministries in Beijing. Alibaba Cloud was reportedly sanctioned by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology after a worker there was credited with disclosing the Log4j vulnerability to the Apache Software Foundation instead of to the Chinese government.Alexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "text": " A data leak described as containing email addresses for over 200 million Twitter users has been published on a popular hacker forum for about $2. BleepingComputer has confirmed the validity of many of the email addresses listed in the leak.Since July 22nd, 2022, threat actors and data breach collectors have been selling and circulating large data sets of scraped Twitter user profiles containing both private (phone numbers and email addresses) and public data on various online hacker forums and cybercrime marketplaces.The threat actors then used another API to scrape the public Twitter data for the ID and combined this public data with private email addresses/phone numbers to create profiles of Twitter users.Today, a threat actor released a data set consisting of 200 million Twitter profiles on the Breached hacking forum for eight credits of the forum's currency, worth approximately $2.This data set is allegedly the same as the 400 million set circulating in November but cleaned up to not contain duplicates, reducing the total to around 221,608,279 lines. However, BleepingComputer's tests have also confirmed duplicates in this latest leaked data.The data was released as a RAR archive consisting of six text files for a combined size of 59 GB of data.Each line in the files represents a Twitter user and their data, which includes email addresses, names, screen names, follow counts, and account creation dates, as shown below.Unlike previously leaked data collected using this Twitter API flaw, today's leak does not indicate whether an account is verified.While BleepingComputer has been able to confirm that the email addresses are correct for many of the listed Twitter profiles, the full data set has obviously not been confirmed.Furthermore, the data set is far from complete, as there were many users who were not found in the leak.Whether or not your information is in this data set highly depends on whether your email address was exposed in previous data breaches.In 2021, the threat actors created massive lists of email addresses and phone numbers that were exposed in previous data breaches.The scrapers then fed these lists into the API bug to see if your number or email address was associated with a corresponding Twitter ID with the email or phone number.If your email address is only used at Twitter or was not in many data breaches, it would not have been fed into the API bug and added to this data set.BleepingComputer has contacted Twitter regarding this leaked data but has not received a response to this or our previous emails.Troy Hunt, the creator of HIBP, told BleepingComputer that there is a total of 211,524,284 unique email addresses in the leak, down from the original number of 221,608,279 lines.To check if your email is part of the Twitter leak, you can visit Have I Been Pwned and search with your email. If your email is part of the leak, HIBP will notify you with the list of detected data breaches, including the Twitter one, shown below.Even though this data leak only contains email addresses, it could be used by threat actors to conduct phishing attacks against accounts, especially verified ones.Verified accounts with large followers are highly valued as they are often used to steal cryptocurrency through online scams.This leak is also a significant privacy concern, especially for Twitter users who tweet anonymously. With this leak, it may be possible to identify anonymous Twitter users and expose their real identities.All Twitter users should be on the lookout for targeted phishing scams that attempt to steal your passwords or other sensitive information.Unfortunately, if you are concerned about your identity being revealed by a leaked email address, there is not much you can do.Update 1/5/23: Twitter users can now search on Have I Been Pwned to see if they are in the leak."

      "title": "Irish privacy watchdog fines Meta $400 million amid disagreement among European authorities",
      "text": " Ireland’s data privacy watchdog has handed down a €390 million (about $413 million) fine to Meta after two years-long inquiries into the data processing operations of Facebook and Instagram.The inquiries resulted from two complaints filed in May 2018 centered on the legal justifications used by the social media giant for the collection of user data. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) ruled that Meta did not clearly outline to users the “processing operations” that were being carried out with personal data nor what that data was being used for. The lack of transparency was a violation of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While a blow to Meta, the decision also exposed disagreement within Europe over how to enforce the GDPR. The original fines proposed by the DPC were much lower and were only raised on orders from the European data protection authority. The DPC ultimately regulates Meta because its European headquarters are based in Dublin.Ireland’s commission originally determined that Meta did not violate the GDPR by relying on “forced consent” – whereby Facebook and Instagram force users to “accept” a terms of service agreement in order to use the platforms. Other bodies within Europe disagreed, concluding the company was indeed in violation of the law. Those terms of service agreements are used by Meta to justify the legality of their data collection practices.   Under the GDPR, bodies like the DPC submit their decisions to regulators across the European Union. The other privacy watchdogs agreed with the DPC’s first assessment around transparency but said the fines needed to be increased. On the second issue, 10 of the 47 privacy authorities in Europe raised objections to DPC’s findings. Several privacy watchdogs said Meta should not be allowed to rely on byzantine terms of service agreements to justify the use of personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram. The personalized ads were not \"necessary to perform the core elements\" of the social media platforms' functions, they found.The DPC, however, argued that Facebook and Instagram are “personalized services that also feature personalized advertising” – which is “central to the bargain struck between users and their chosen service provider, and forms part of the contract concluded at the point at which users accept the Terms of Service.”The two sides could not agree on a resolution and the decision was then sent to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which ruled on December 5 that the DPC needed to increase its fine and backed the 10 watchdogs that disagreed with Meta’s legal justifications for data collection. The EDPB’s ruling on the additional violation of GDPR is what prompted the DPC to increase the fine to €210 million (about $229 million) for Facebook privacy violations and €180 million (About $200 million) for Instagram. Meta now has three months to bring its operations into compliance with the GDPR or they will face additional fines. The EDPB also ordered the DPC to conduct a new investigation into Facebook and Instagram’s data processing operations – something the DPC vehemently disagreed with and plans to challenge in court.Meta will now have to get \"opt-in\" consent for personalized advertising and must provide users with a \"yes/no\" option, the organization explained. They noted that a third complaint they filed against another Meta service – WhatsApp – has been delayed until mid-January. \"Instead of having a 'yes/no' option for personalized ads, they just moved the consent clause in the terms and conditions. This is not just unfair but clearly illegal. We are not aware of any other company that has tried to ignore the GDPR in such an arrogant way,\" said Max Schrems, a NOYB privacy expert. “This case is about a simple legal question. Meta claims that the 'bypass' happened with the blessing of the DPC. For years the DPC has dragged out the procedure and insisted that Meta may bypass the GDPR, but was now overruled by the other EU authorities. It is overall the fourth time in a row the Irish DPC got overruled.\"A Meta spokesperson told The Record that the level of disagreement within Europe demonstrated by the DPC’s press release was \"very telling,\" adding that there is a \"total lack of regulatory certainty or clarity on this topic.\" The spokesperson said the company has a variety of options to process user data and they are currently assessing which to use. “The debate around legal bases has been ongoing for some time and businesses have faced a lack of regulatory certainty in this area. We strongly believe our approach respects GDPR, and we’re therefore disappointed by these decisions and intend to appeal both the substance of the rulings and the fines,” a Meta spokesperson said. “These decisions do not prevent targeted or personalized advertising on our platform. The decisions relate only to which legal basis Meta uses when offering certain advertising. Advertisers can continue to use our platforms to reach potential customers, grow their business and create new markets.” Schrems criticized the DPC for allegedly holding 10 confidential meetings with Meta and accused the watchdog of helping Meta skirt GDPR rules. Schrems said the Irish authority also tried to influence the European regulatory body to rule in favor of Meta. He argued that despite what was in DPC’s statement, the privacy watchdog “shielded Meta and they got voted down on the EU level.\"“The decision means that Meta must allow users to have a version of all apps that does not use personal data for ads within three months,” NOYB said. “The decision would still allow Meta to use non-personal data (such as the content of a story) to personalize ads or to ask users for consent to ads via a 'yes/no' option. Users must be able to withdraw consent at any time and Meta may not limit the service if users choose to do so. While this will limit Meta's profits dramatically in the EU, it would not fully prohibit ads.”The privacy non-profit also took issue with DPC’s rollout of the decision, noting that the watchdog only informed them today that they would not be releasing the full decision to them, citing confidentiality, despite the fact that the organization is a plaintiff in the case. Schrems said he has never seen a decision only being served to one party, but not the other. According to Schrems, the original fine proposed by DPC was between €28 million to €36 million (about $29 million to $38 million). He noted that Meta has been hit with fines totaling nearly €1 billion ($1.06 billion) since the GDPR went into effect.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Overall, threat actors leaked 4,18,777 rows of sensitive data from the bank's customers, including details such as Colombian national ID numbers — called \"Cedula\" numbers — as well as email addresses, phone numbers, customer names, payment records, salary, home addresses, and other data, researchers said.So far, researchers have not seen the data dumped on any hacker forums or Dark Web sites, and are following standard breach-disclosure guidelines as they further investigate, they said.Key capabilities of BitRAT include: data exfiltration, execution of payloads with bypasses, distributed denial of service (DDoS), keylogging, webcam and microphone recording, credential theft, Monero mining, and running tasks for process, file, and software, among others.To that end, researchers advised that all organizations employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect malware such as BitRAT as it inserts itself into a network endpoint, they said. Functions like asset management, vulnerability detection, policy compliance, patch management, and file-integrity monitoring capabilities across a system are key for combating malware like this, they added.Enterprises should also implement external attack surface management solutions, which allow for continuous monitoring and reduction of the entire enterprise attack surface — including internal and Internet-facing assets and discover previously unidentified exposures — to counter evolving threats, researchers said.Researchers found and analyzed a cache of Excel sheets — all authored by \"Administrator\" — being used as lures for a BitRAT campaign, with data from the tables being reused in Excel maldocs as well being included in the database dump, they said.\"The Excel contains a highly obfuscated macro that will drop an .inf payload and execute it,\" Pradhan wrote in the post. \"The .inf payload is segmented into hundreds of arrays in the macro.\"A de-obfuscation routine performs arithmetic operations on the arrays to rebuild the payload once it's ready for execution, with the macro then writing the payload to \"temp\" and executing it via a file called advpack.dll, he said.The macro itself also includes a hex-encoded, second-stage .dll payload that is decoded via certutil, written to \"%temp%\\,\" and executed by the command \"rundll32,\" researchers found. After this process is executed, the temp files are then deleted, they said.It's this .dll file that uses various anti-debugging techniques to download and execute the final BitRAT payload. The file also uses the WinHTTP library to download BitRAT-embedded payloads from a GitHub repository created in mid-November by a \"throwaway\" account to the \"%temp%\" directory, Pradhan wrote.In the final stage of BitRAT execution, the .dll uses WinExec to start the \"%temp%\" payload and exits. To maintain persistence on a user's machine, the BitRAT sample starts and then relocates the loader to the user's startup, the researchers said.Copyright © 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place, London, SW1P 1WG."

      "text": " Almost twenty car manufacturers and services contained API security vulnerabilities that could have allowed hackers to perform malicious activity, ranging from unlocking, starting, and tracking cars to exposing customers' personal information.The security flaws impacted well-known brands, including BMW, Roll Royce, Mercedes-Benz, Ferrari, Porsche, Jaguar, Land Rover, Ford, KIA, Honda, Infiniti, Nissan, Acura, Hyundai, Toyota, and Genesis.The vulnerabilities also affected vehicle technology brands Spireon, Reviver, and SiriusXM Connected Vehicle Services.The impacted vendors have fixed all issues presented in this report, so they are not exploitable now.The most severe API flaws were found in BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which were affected by company-wide SSO (single-sign-on) vulnerabilities that enabled attackers to access internal systems.For Mercedes-Benz, the analysts could access multiple private GitHub instances, internal chat channels on Mattermost, servers, Jenkins and AWS instances, XENTRY systems that connect to customer cars, and more.For BMW, the researchers could access internal dealer portals, query VINs for any car, and retrieve sales documents containing sensitive owner details.Additionally, they could leverage the SSO flaws to log in as any employee or dealer and access applications reserved for internal use.Exploiting other API flaws allowed the researchers to access PII (personally identifiable information) for owners of KIA, Honda, Infiniti, Nissan, Acura, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Genesis, BMW, Roll Royce, Ferrari, Ford, Porsche, and Toyota cars.In the cases of ultra-expensive cars, disclosing owner information is particularly dangerous as, in some cases, the data includes sales information, physical location, and customer addresses.Ferrari suffered from poorly implemented SSO on its CMS, exposing backend API routes and making it possible to extract credentials from JavaScript snippets.An attacker could exploit these flaws to access, modify, or delete any Ferrari customer account, manage their vehicle profile, or set themselves as car owners.These vulnerabilities could have also allowed hackers to track cars in real time, introducing potential physical risks and impacting the privacy of millions of car owners.Porsche was one of the impacted brands, with flaws in its telematic systems enabling attackers to retrieve vehicle locations and send commands.GPS tracking solution Spireon was also vulnerable to car location disclosure, impacting 15.5 million vehicles using its services and even letting full administration access to its remote management panel, enabling attackers to unlock cars, start the engine, or disable the starter.The third impacted entity is Reviver, a digital license plate maker that was vulnerable to unauthenticated, remote access to its admin panel that could have given anyone access to GPS data and user records, the ability to change license plate messaging, and more.Curry illustrates how these flaws allowed them to mark a vehicle as \"STOLEN\" on the Reviver panel, which would automatically inform the police about the incident, putting the owner/driver at unnecessary risk.Car owners can protect themselves from these types of vulnerabilities by limiting the amount of personal information stored in vehicles or mobile companion apps. It is also essential to set in-car telematics to the most private mode available and read privacy policies to understand how data is being used.\"When purchasing a used car, make sure that the prior owner's account has been removed. Use strong passwords and set up 2FA (two-factor authentication) if possible for apps and services which link to your vehicle,\" warned Curry in a statement to BleepingComputer.Update 1/4 - A Spireon spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:Our cybersecurity professionals met with the security researcher to discuss and evaluate the purported system vulnerabilities and immediately implemented remedial measures to the extent required.We also took proactive steps to further strengthen the security across our product portfolio as part of our continuing commitment to our customers as a leading provider of aftermarket telematics solutions.Spireon takes all security matters seriously and utilizes an extensive industry leading toolset to monitor and scan its products and services for both known and novel potential security risks.Update 1/11 - A Reviver spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment:We were recently contacted by a cybersecurity researcher regarding potential application vulnerabilities in the auto industry. Our team immediately investigated this report, met with the researcher, and, out of an abundance of caution, engaged leading data security and privacy professionals to assist.We are proud of our team’s quick response, which patched our application in under 24 hours and took further measures to prevent this from occurring in the future.Our investigation confirmed that this potential vulnerability has not been misused. Customer information has not been affected, and there is no evidence of ongoing risk related to this report.As part of our commitment to data security and privacy, we also used this opportunity to identify and implement additional safeguards to supplement our existing, significant protections.Cybersecurity is central to our mission to modernize the driving experience and we will continue to work with industry-leading professionals, tools, and systems to build and monitor our secure platforms for connected vehicles."
