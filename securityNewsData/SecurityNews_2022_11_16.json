      "text": "  The report also found that lookalike domains are also targeting these top companies, with 75% of homoglyph registrations registered to unrelated third parties. The result: many of the world’s leading brands must contend with maliciously registered domains that look like their brands. Mark Calandra, president of CSC’s Digital Brand Services, said companies need to make securing legitimate domains while monitoring for malicious domains a bigger priority, especially for companies that advocate for zero-trust principles.“Otherwise, companies are exposing themselves to significant enterprise risks that can impact their cybersecurity posture, data protection, intellectual property, supply chains, consumer safety, revenue, and reputation,” Calandra said.Imposter or lookalike domains can pose a serious security threat to companies large and small, said Patrick Tiquet, vice president, security and architecture at Keeper Security. Tiquet said a common defense against these rogue imposter domains is for companies to purchase the most likely domains that users may mistake for their legitimate domain. However, it's not a 100% effective method of protection, as there are often countless and unpredictable ways a user may get tricked by an imposter domain.“An organization may find itself in a ‘whack-a-mole’ situation, where once it shuts down a malicious imposter domain, another pops up in its place with slight variation in spelling,” Tiquet said.John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, added that nothing on the internet happens that doesn’t begin without a DNS request. Similarly, nothing bad on the internet starts without a DNS request.“It’s the invisible glue that holds the internet together and while it was not designed for how we use it today (with minimal built-in security functions) some are there,” Bambenek said. “DMARC is one of the single best tools to prevent email-based brand impersonation. CAA can help prevent errant certificate issues. Most people don’t see major DNS issues in the news. However, very simple measures can help mitigate a wide variety of threats and they are free and easy to deploy.”Muralidharan Palanisamy, chief solutions officer at AppViewX, said homoglyph or lookalike domains are widely used to launch phishing attacks. Since the technology behind DNS has not experienced major changes, its budget typically stays the same and security teams oversee the challenges and risks with DNS. Thus, Palanisamy said it’s important for enterprises to implement some of the leading security features like DNSSEC and CAA that are not easy to maintain without automation.“Apart from this, lookalike domains are a challenge,” Palanisamy said. “Registering these domains is not easy and ultimately requires teams to leverage a reputed domain registrar to help mitigate this to a certain level. Security is multi-faceted and organizations have to look at all these areas to mitigate the risks.\"BleepingComputer reports that Russian majority state-owned financial services firm Sberbank has been disrupted by a distributed denial-of-service attack that peaked at one million requests per second.OpenAI reported multiple disruptions this week, culminating in a distributed-denial-of-service attack on ChatGPT on Nov. 8.SecurityWeek reports that patches have been released by Veeam to remediate four security vulnerabilities impacting its Veeam ONE IT monitoring and analytics solution.Tue Dec 17On-Demand EventOn-Demand Event   \n        Copyright © 2023 CyberRisk Alliance, LLC All Rights Reserved.\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed\n        in any form without prior authorization.\n      "

      "title": "Treasury Targets Actors Involved in Production and Transfer of Iranian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Russia for Use in Ukraine | U.S. Department of the Treasury",
      "text": "     WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning firms involved in the production or ongoing transfer to Russia of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which Russia has used in devastating attacks against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. OFAC is designating Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center, the firm responsible for the design and production of Shahed-series UAVs being used by Russian forces in Ukraine. OFAC is also targeting Success Aviation Services FZC and i Jet Global DMCC for facilitating the transfer of Iranian UAVs to Russia. The U.S. Department of State is concurrently designating Russian Private Military Company “Wagner” (PMC Wagner) and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force (IRGC ASF) and Qods Aviation Industries pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024. To supplement the U.S. Department of State’s designation of PMC Wagner, OFAC is also designating two individuals for facilitating PMC Wagner’s acquisition of UAVs from Iran, Abbas Djuma and Tigran Khristoforovich Srabionov.“As we have demonstrated repeatedly, the United States is determined to sanction people and companies, no matter where they are located, that support Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine. Today’s action exposes and holds accountable companies and individuals that have enabled Russia’s use of Iranian-built UAVs to brutalize Ukrainian civilians,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “This is part of our larger effort to disrupt Russia’s war effort and deny the equipment it needs through sanctions and export controls.”Today’s action is being taken pursuant to E.O. 13382 and E.O. 14024 and follows OFAC’s September 8, 2022 designation of an Iranian air transportation service provider involved in the shipment of Iranian UAVs to Russia, as well as three companies and one individual involved in the research, development, production, and procurement of Iranian UAVs and UAV components for Iran’s IRGC and its Aerospace Force (IRGC ASF) and Navy. This also follows the October 20, 2022 decision by the European Union to impose sanctions on three Iranian military leaders and Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center for their role in the development and delivery of UAVs used by Russia in its war against Ukraine.Shahed Aviation Industries Research Center (SAIRC), subordinate to the IRGC ASF, has designed and manufactured several Shahed-series UAV variants, including the Shahed-136 one-way attack UAV that Russian forces have used in recent attacks targeting civilian infrastructure in Kyiv, Odesa, and the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. SAIRC also developed the Shahed-129 medium-altitude reconnaissance and strike UAV for the IRGC ASF, and it is the lead contractor for the IRGC ASF’s Shahed-171 project.SAIRC is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13382 for having provided, or attempted to provide, financial, material, technological or other support for, or goods or services in support of, the IRGC ASF. The IRGC ASF, also known as the IRGC Air Force, was designated pursuant to E.O. 13382 on June 16, 2010 as a key element in the operational deployment of Iran’s ballistic missile capability.UAE-based air transportation firms Success Aviation Services FZC (Success Aviation) and i Jet Global DMCC (iJet) collaborated with U.S.-sanctioned Iranian firm Safiran Airport Services (Safiran) to coordinate flights between Iran and Russia, including those associated with transporting Iranian UAVs, personnel, and related equipment from Iran to Russia. The actions against the UAE-based targets are being taken in cooperation with the UAE government. Success Aviation continues to cooperate with Safiran even after the latter’s designation, including to facilitate travel between Russia and Iran. iJet also continues to work with Safiran to coordinate Russian Air Force flights between Iran and Russia despite Safiran’s designation and exposure.Safiran was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 on September 8, 2022 for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of the Russian Federation (GoR).iJet has also worked with U.S.-sanctioned, Syria-based Cham Wings Airlines (Cham Wings). iJet has allegedly used its branch in Syria, known as Trade Med Middle East, to assist Cham Wings in facilitating the transport of Syrian fighters to Russia. Cham Wings was designated pursuant to E.O. 13582 on December 23, 2016 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, the Government of Syria and Syrian Arab Airlines, a U.S.-designated airline that Iran’s IRGC-Qods Force has used to transfer illicit cargo to Syria. Success Aviation and iJet are being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the GoR.PMC Wagner is a Russian private military company with ties to the Russian government that has been used to engage in conflicts on the Russian government’s behalf around the world. PMC Wagner was previously designated pursuant to E.O. 13660 in 2017 for being responsible for or complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly, actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine. The European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Japan have also sanctioned PMC Wagner.The State Department today is concurrently designating PMC Wagner pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy. In coordination with the State Department’s redesignation of PMC Wagner, OFAC is taking action against individuals facilitating the movement of Iranian UAVs to Russia.  Abbas Djuma (Djuma) and Tigran Khristoforovich Srabionov (Srabionov) were involved in PMC Wagner’s acquisition of Iranian UAVs to support combat operations in Ukraine.Djuma is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods and services to or in support of, PMC Wagner. Srabionov is being designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, PMC Wagner. As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the individuals and entities that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons must be blocked and reported to OFAC. OFAC sanctions generally prohibit all dealings by U.S. persons or within the United States (including transactions transiting the United States) that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.In addition, persons that engage in certain transactions with the individuals or entities designated today may themselves be exposed to sanctions. Furthermore, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates a significant transaction or provides significant financial services for any of the individuals or entities designated today pursuant to E.O. 13382 could be subject to U.S. sanctions.  ### "

      "text": " North Korean hackers are using a new version of the DTrack backdoor to attack organizations in Europe and Latin America.DTrack is a modular backdoor featuring a keylogger, a screenshot snapper, a browser history retriever, a running processes snooper, an IP address and network connection information snatcher, and more.Apart from spying, it can also run commands to perform file operations, fetch additional payloads, steal files and data, and execute processes on the compromised device.The new malware version doesn't feature many functional or code changes compared to samples analyzed in the past, but it is now deployed far more widely.The targeted sectors include government research centers, policy institutes, chemical manufacturers, IT service providers, telecommunication providers, utility service providers, and education.In the new campaign, Kaspersky has seen DTrack distributed using filenames commonly associated with legitimate executables.When launched, the malware goes through multiple decryption steps before its final payload is loaded via process hollowing into an \"explorer.exe\" process, running directly from memory.The only differences to past DTrack variants are it now uses API hashing to load libraries and functions instead of obfuscated strings, and that the number of C2 servers has been cut by half to just three.Some of the C2 servers uncovered by Kaspersky are “pinkgoat[.]com”, “purewatertokyo[.]com”, “purplebear[.]com”, and “salmonrabbit[.]com.”Kaspersky attributes this activity to the North Korean Lazarus hacking group and claims the threat actors use DTrack whenever they see the potential for financial gains."

      "text": " Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov, the accused 40-year-old Ukrainian leader of a prolific cybercriminal group that stole tens of millions of dollars from small to mid-sized businesses in the United States and Europe, has been arrested in Switzerland, according to multiple sources.Wanted Ukrainian cybercrime suspect Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov (right) was arrested in Geneva, Switzerland. Tank was the day-to-day manager of a cybercriminal group that stole tens of millions of dollars from small to mid-sized businesses.Penchukov was named in a 2014 indictment by the U.S. Department of Justice as a top figure in the JabberZeus Crew, a small but potent cybercriminal collective from Ukraine and Russia that attacked victim companies with a powerful, custom-made version of the Zeus banking trojan.The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declined to comment for this story. But according to multiple sources, Penchukov was arrested in Geneva, Switzerland roughly three weeks ago as he was traveling to meet up with his wife there.Tank, a.k.a. “DJ Slava Rich,” seen here performing as a DJ in Ukraine in an undated photo from social media.Investigators knew Bogachev and JabberZeus were linked because for many years they were reading the private Jabber chats between and among members of the JabberZeus crew, and Bogachev’s monitored aliases were in semi-regular contact with the group about updates to the malware.Gary Warner, director of research in computer forensics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, noted in his blog from 2014 that Tank told co-conspirators in a JabberZeus chat on July 22, 2009 that his daughter, Miloslava, had been born and gave her birth weight.“A search of Ukrainian birth records only showed one girl named Miloslava with that birth weight born on that day,” Warner wrote. This was enough to positively identify Tank as Penchukov, Warner said.“In early October, the Ukrainian surveillance team said they’d lost him,” he wrote. “The Americans were unhappy, and a little surprised. But they were also resigned to what they saw as the realities of working in Ukraine. The country had a notorious corruption problem. The running joke was that it was easy to find the SBU’s anticorruption unit—just look for the parking lot full of BMWs.”I first encountered Tank and the JabberZeus crew roughly 14 years ago as a reporter for The Washington Post, after a trusted source confided that he’d secretly gained access to the group’s private Jabber conversations.From reading those discussions each day, it became clear Tank was nominally in charge of the Ukrainian crew, and that he spent much of his time overseeing the activities of the money mule recruiters — which were an integral part of their victim cashout scheme.It was soon discovered that the phony corporate websites the money mule recruiters used to manage new hires had a security weakness that allowed anyone who signed up at the portal to view messages for every other user. A scraping tool was built to harvest these money mule recruitment messages, and at the height of the JabberZeus gang’s activity in 2010 that scraper was monitoring messages on close to a dozen different money mule recruitment sites, each managing hundreds of “employees.”When it came time to transfer stolen funds, the recruiters would send a message through the fake company website saying something like: “Good morning [mule name here]. Our client — XYZ Corp. — is sending you some money today. Please visit your bank now and withdraw this payment in cash, and then wire the funds in equal payments — minus your commission — to these three individuals in Eastern Europe.”Only, in every case the company mentioned as the “client” was in fact a small business whose payroll accounts they’d already hacked into.So, each day for several years my morning routine went as follows: Make a pot of coffee; shuffle over to the computer and view the messages Tank and his co-conspirators had sent to their money mules over the previous 12-24 hours; look up the victim company names in Google; pick up the phone to warn each that they were in the process of being robbed by the Russian Cyber Mob.My spiel on all of these calls was more or less the same: “You probably have no idea who I am, but here’s all my contact info and what I do. Your payroll accounts have been hacked, and you’re about to lose a great deal of money. You should contact your bank immediately and have them put a hold on any pending transfers before it’s too late. Feel free to call me back afterwards if you want more information about how I know all this, but for now please just call or visit your bank.”In many instances, my call would come in just minutes or hours before an unauthorized payroll batch was processed by the victim company’s bank, and some of those notifications prevented what otherwise would have been enormous losses — often several times the amount of the organization’s normal weekly payroll. At some point I stopped counting how many tens of thousands of dollars those calls saved victims, but over several years it was probably in the millions.Just as often, the victim company would suspect that I was somehow involved in the robbery, and soon after alerting them I would receive a call from an FBI agent or from a police officer in the victim’s hometown. Those were always interesting conversations.tank: Are you there?\ntank: This is what they damn wrote about me.\ntank: http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/07/an_odyssey_of_fraud_part_ii.html#more\ntank: I’ll take a quick look at history\ntank: Originator: BULLITT COUNTY FISCAL Company: Bullitt County Fiscal Court\ntank: Well, you got [it] from that cash-in.\nlucky12345: From 200K?\ntank: Well, they are not the right amounts and the cash out from that account was shitty.\ntank: Levak was written there.\ntank: Because now the entire USA knows about Zeus.\ntank: 😀\nlucky12345: It’s fucked.On Dec. 13, 2009, one of Tank’s top money mule recruiters — a crook who used the pseudonym “Jim Rogers” — told his boss something I hadn’t shared beyond a few trusted confidants at that point: That The Washington Post had eliminated my job in the process of merging the newspaper’s Web site (where I worked at the time) with the dead tree edition.jim_rogers: There is a rumor that our favorite (Brian) didn’t get his contract extension at Washington Post. We are giddily awaiting confirmation 🙂 Good news expected exactly by the New Year! Besides us no one reads his column 🙂tank: Mr. Fucking Brian Fucking Kerbs!Another member of the JabberZeus crew — Ukrainian-born Maksim “Aqua” Yakubets — also is currently wanted by the FBI, which is offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.Alleged “Evil Corp” bigwig Maksim “Aqua” Yakubets. Image: FBI“During the hearing on 24 October, 2022, the person did not consent to his extradition to the USA via a simplified proceeding,” the FOJ continued. “After completion of the formal extradition procedure, the FOJ has decided to grant his extradition to the USA on 15 November, 2022. The decision of the FOJ may be appealed at the Swiss Criminal Federal Court, respectively at the Swiss Supreme Court.”\r\n         This entry was posted on Tuesday 15th of November 2022 10:38 AM \r\n         Great story, Brian. Any idea how the news about the Post eliminating your job leaked?Must admit, the leak of Brian’s job termination is most intriguing. Also was surprised at how bad the OPSEC of the hacker was in that he gave out precise personal data, have to wonder if it was because he thought he had enduring impunity.I have to admit Ukrainian Government has shown a real talent propaganda narratives lately, but this is something different …During the Blitz Winston Churchill stood on the floor of the House of Commons and noted that ‘Blitz’ was a losing strategy with diminishing returns.  Eventually the bombs would as he put it just make the ‘rubble jump’.  That’s a heck of a thing to tell somebody sleeping in the underground every night, but there it is.I think it’s time somebody told Computer Security folk yelling Arms Race ! that the rubble is jumping.Re Ukrainian government, note that the corruption was before Euromaidan, when the very corrupt government was thrown out and the president had to flee…to Russia. Doesn’t mean all current Ukrainian citizens are angels, but…Not sure I’m understanding your point about yelling “Arms Race.” Churchhill’s point was that Nazi bombers had already done everything they could. I…assume you’re not trying to claim “Computer Security” people have already done everything they can possibly do to prevent attacks? If you are, reading though a blog called KrebsOnSecurity might disabuse you of the notion. 🙂I see your point, and yes I have, since before it was born actually when Brian worked at the WAPO.  My views on Computer Security practice are informed by a web classic “Enumerating Goodness”.  The gist is that once somebody screams “Arms Race” the data collection game changes to protect the legacy revenue stream.  When I early voted recently I had a one guy with three valid driver’s licenses ahead of me. He was moving, building a house, etc.. The “system” was baffled but quickly fixed by the poll workers … they had him walk through the door with one license, then back through the door with the next, then the third … although the second turned out to be the charm.  Fortunately there were only two people and four identities in line, but it gives you an appreciation for the difference security and a career in “Computer Security”.Krebs ,   should  do a   article  on  all the  money mule  scams   going on with  Facebook(.).comConsidering the Post had a spy working for them, probably around that time, hardly surprising.It is quite revealing that they couldn’t actually charge him with the actual crime. “Conspiracy to…” sounds like they have nothing. They list bank fraud and identity theft too. But shouldn’t there be something about breaking into millions of other people’s computers or creating the required toolkit with malicious intent at least?Are they trying to get him for one of the biggest malware campaigns in history or just some three card monte in a backyard…You didn’t read did you? The indictments are for the actual crime. “conspiracy to” is in ADDITION TO the other charges.\nWhen the DOJ indicts, they usually add conspiracy charges on top of the actual crime. The conspiracy charge allows them to add other co-conspirators and add to the sentence because they willfully collaborated to continue the crime.“All of the defendants are charged with conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and multiple counts of bank fraud.”Maybe its confusing with all the commas.  The identity theft and bank fraud are serious charges by themselves.  Those are also the “actual crimes”.  “Creating the the toolkit with malicious intent” would be called, “conspiracy to commit computer fraud in the proper legal terms.\nMaybe you think “conspiracy” isn’t a real crime, or that it means something more like “attempted” but didn’t commit.\nBut the law is different than you think.  Conspiracy means the crime was committed, but with others.The description with the pot of coffee and the phone calls made me chuckle.  Brian must have been saving that little nugget for years… until the day their ringleader was apprehended!\nI am astounded that someone who made a living by breaking through security measures would have such disregard for his own operational security.  Even after he knew something was wrong, it didn’t occur to him to try to find the problem and fix it.I cannot imagine the level of smug that you must have felt after your morning calls were completed the first day every single one instantly blocked the payments, Brian. That’s a hell of a wake-up routine.\n(I would also love to, if you have time, hear your write-up of a few example responses from local PDs/FBI offices trying to work out what’s going on)Brian\nThanks for the bio on “Tank”.\nIt added much to the story, and the slow grinding wheels of justice.\nWasn’t “Tank” also nominated 2 times for the “Alberto Gonzales Lifetime Achievement Award” in superior hacking?Informative as Always. Thanks Brian !!!Comments are closed.Mailing ListSearch KrebsOnSecurityRecent PostsStory CategoriesWhy So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia"

      "text": " Symantec Threat Hunter Team Senior Intelligence Analyst Brigid O Gorman told The Record that the attack on the certificate authority was especially alarming. If the attackers were successful in compromising it, they could use their access certificates to sign malware with a valid certificate that would allow them to avoid detection on devices. “It could also potentially use compromised certificates to intercept HTTPS traffic,” O Gorman said.“Apart from this, compromising an organization’s systems could also potentially allow the attackers to carry out ‘regular’ espionage activity such as lateral movement on victim machines, accessing credentials, and exfiltrating data.”The certification authority in question was notified of the hack and found no evidence to suggest the hackers were successful in compromising digital certificates.Symantec researchers tied the activity of Billbug to the attack on the certificate authority due to the tools used, which they have employed in the past.“In this campaign, all of Billbug’s victims were located in Asia. Historically, Billbug has appeared to be primarily interested in targets in the government, defense and communications sectors, primarily in Southeast Asia, indicating that those behind these operations likely have a strategic interest in countries in that region,” O Gorman said. “However, in activity we did also see the group targeting organizations based in the U.S.”The group uses an array of backdoors and other tools during their attacks. Symantec noted that with one of the government victims, a “large number of machines on the network were compromised by the attackers.”Symantec said the targeting of government agencies and a certificate authority indicates that the primary motive of the campaign is espionage and data theft.Jonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "text": " Older versions of the Spotify Backstage development portal builder are vulnerable to a critical (CVSS score: 9.8) unauthenticated remote code execution flaw allowing attackers to run commands on publicly exposed systems.As Backstage uses the vm2 library, it, too, was affected by the vulnerability via the supply chain.Oxeye confirmed the impact in Backstage and alerted Spotify on August 18, 2022. The vendor then addressed it via an update (v 1.5.1) released on August 29, 2022, only a day after vm2 was patched with version 3.9.11.The Oxeye team developed a working payload to attack Backstage's Scaffolder plugin for sandbox escape and code execution, trying it out on a local deployment.The malicious code was injected in a modified function of the rendering engine of the said plugin, run in the context of the virtual machine, and triggered by an error that invokes an undefined function.The payload creates a CallSite object outside the sandbox, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.Oxeye's scans on Shodan revealed that 546 publicly exposed Backstage instances on the internet could be exploitable, most based in the United States.Due to this, even a single vulnerable instance could be enough to cause a significant breach in a high-profile company.To make matters worse, Backstage APIs are available without authentication by default. Unless the instances are blocked by network filtering rules or identity management, they could be accessed by any remote user.This means that guest users could potentially attack Internet-exposed instances without needing credentials.\"Thus we concluded the vulnerability could be exploited without authentication on many instances.\"Currently, the number of instances running Backstage versions before 1.5.1 is unknown.All system administrators are advised to upgrade to the latest release, Backstage version 1.7.2, which came out last week.Finally, the researchers warn to enable both front and backend authentication to prevent unauthorized access to Backstage APIs."

The vulnerable Zendesk Explore facility is not enabled by default but still widely used because it powers the analytic insights page of the CRM platform.“One of the fields passed to the API is extra_param3_value which includes a plain-text XML document, DesignSchema, not encoded in Base64.”Varonis discovered that the name attributes in this XML document were vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The security researchers found a way to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data.In response to questions from The Daily Swig, Michael Buckbee, a security engineer at Varonis, explained that although the issue is complicated on multiple levels by encoding, “at its heart” it’s a classic SQL injection problem.“The root cause was fields that were not properly filtered in the application,” Buckbee explained.The researcher added: “While the method that the SQL command is passed from the client back to Zendesk is complicated with multiple levels of Base64-encoded JSON and XML as part of a GraphQL action, the root cause of the SQL Injection isn’t the multiple levels of encoding, but insufficient validation happening on the application server parsing the response.”The researchers went on to discover that the execute-query API failed to carry out several logical checks on requests.Zendesk quickly resolved the issues in Explore with Varonis Threat Labs’ help, without requiring customers to take any action.The Daily Swig invited Zendesk to comment on the vulnerabilities, Varonis’ research, and its remediation action.

      "title": "New Vulnerabilities Discovered in 5 WooCommerce WordPress Plugins - CySecurity News - Latest Information Security and Hacking Incidents",
      "text": " Many of the vulnerabilities are rated 9.8, on the scale of 1-10, ranging in severity from moderate to as excessive as Essential. The respective vulnerabilities were provided a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identity number, given to the discovered vulnerabilities. Advanced Order Exported For WooCommerce The Advanced Order Export for WooCommerce plugin that was installed on as many as 100,000 websites, is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack (CSRF). A CSRF vulnerability is created via a flaw in a website plugin, that enables the threat actor to deceive the online user into conducting an unintentional action. Generally, a website browser consists of cookies that notify a website that a user is registered and logged in. The threat actor could assume the privilege levels of an admin, giving him complete access to a website. Consequently, exposing admin’s sensitive customer information. This vulnerability could lead to an export file download. It may be reasonable to presume that order data is the type of file an attacker can access, given that the plugin's goal is to export WooCommerce order data. 1. Official Vulnerability Description: \nThe Official vulnerability description states that “Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce plugin <= 3.3.2 on WordPress leading to export file download.” This vulnerability could impact all versions of the Advanced Order Export for WooCommerce plugin that is less than or equal to version 3.3.2. 2.\tAdvanced Dynamic Pricing for WooCommerce: The second affected plugin, the Superior Dynamic Pricing plugin for WooCommerce is being put in over 20,000 websites. The plugin was discovered to have two CSRF vulnerabilities, having an impact on all plugin versions lower than 4.1.6. The goal of the plugin is to make it simpler for retailers to create low-cost and pricing guidelines. The primary vulnerability (CVE-2022-43488) can result in a “rule sort migration.” The official description by the NVD reads “Cross-Web site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Superior Dynamic Pricing for WooCommerce plugin <= 4.1.5 on WordPress resulting in rule sort migration.” 3.\tAdvanced Coupons for WooCommerce Coupons plugin: The third plugin that was affected, Advanced Coupons for WooCommerce Coupons, has over 10,000 installs.

Where a user clicked on any elements of the spoofed toolbar, it would send their credentials to an attacker's server.Due to the CSP, Heyes couldn’t use inline styles. However, looking at the CSS files, he found a class that had opacity:0 “in a couple of seconds”, which “worked perfectly”.He explained to The Daily Swig: “Add the PoC code into post text area and hit publish – [the] user sees [the] post and clicks on what they think is a Mastodon toolbar. Credentials are [then] sent to an external server.“In a real attack the credentials will be stored and the user redirected back to the site.”Any Mastodon instance using the Gitch fork of Mastodon is vulnerable, Heyes explained, adding that since the server is vulnerable, “there’s not much a user can do to protect themselves”.He added: “However, it would be a good idea to only autofill your password with user interaction to prevent credentials from being stolen.”* PortSwigger Research is the research arm of PortSwigger Ltd, the parent company of The Daily Swig.Burp SuiteVulnerabilitiesCustomersCompanyInsights© 2023 PortSwigger Ltd."
