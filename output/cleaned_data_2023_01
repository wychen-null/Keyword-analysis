        "text": "US and international law enforcement authorities have taken action against the Hive ransomware group including the seizure of US-based servers and the shutdown of at least two of the group's dark net sitesOn Thursday morning two of the groups sites on the dark web used to communicate with and extort victims and leak data for non-paying businesses were replaced with a notice indicating in both English and Russian that the site has been seized in an international law enforcement operation involving the US Department of Justice the FBI Secret Service Germany Europol and other European countriesThe Federal Bureau of Investigation seized this site as part of a coordinated law enforcement action against Hive ransomware the notice reads Garland said the bureaus investigation led them to discover two backend computer servers in Los Angeles used by the group to store dataLast night pursuant to a court order we seized those servers We also received court authorization to wrest control of Hives dark net sites and render its services unavailable said Garland in a press conference Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the FBI has been inside Hive's network for months stealing decryption keys to pass onto victims so they would not have to pay to decrypt their filesSimply put using lawful means we hacked the hackers We turned the tables on Hive and we busted their business model saving potential victims approximately 130 million in ransomware payments said MonacoBased on the search warrant executed Jan 11 the servers were leased using three email addresses that law enforcement had identified as being used by Hive operatorsAccording to testimony from FBI special agent Timothy Callinan the FBI has had access to Hives network since at least July 2022 One of the two US-based servers seized was a redundant backup server hosting Hives Tor-based leak sites and victim negotiation portal The other was a backend server connecting to Hives broader network and infrastructure and also contained records of communication between different Hive members malware hashes as well as information on at least 250 Hive affiliatesThe FBI was able to obtain decryption keys for specific intrusions and said it passed 1000 keys to at least 336 victims helping save them as much as 130 million in ransom payments FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau has since shared decryptor keys with victims in the US as well as many victims overseas He used the seizure as an opportunity to urge additional businesses to come forward and provide assistance to the FBI touting the bureau's efforts to help past victims avoid payments or get their money back and noting that many Hive victims do not report when they are hit with a ransomware attackSo today's lesson for businesses large and small for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this reach out to your local FBI field office today introduce yourself so that you know who to call when you become a victim of a cyber attackAs part of that advisory the agencies asked victims to come forward and submit a range of evidence to authorities that may help the FBI investigate including malware samples images of infected systems malicious IP addresses a copy of their ransom note ransom amounts and Bitcoin wallet informationFrom June 2021 through at least November 2022 threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors including Government Facilities Communications Critical Manufacturing Information Technology and especially Healthcare and Public Health HPH the agencies advised late last yearHowever RaaS groups like Hive are massive decentralized operations with many different affiliates operators and developers John Hultquist Head of Mandiant Threat Intelligence at Google Cloud said he was skeptical that the operation would cripple Hive's operations but it might dissuade them and similar groups from pursuing higher-value targetsThe disruption of the Hive service wont cause a serious drop in overall ransomware activity but it is a blow to a dangerous group that has endangered lives by attacking the healthcare system said Hultquist in a statement Unfortunately the criminal marketplace at the heart of the ransomware problem ensures a Hive competitor will be standing by to offer a similar service in their absence but they may think twice before allowing their ransomware to be used to target hospitalsAustin Berglas a former FBI cyber official who helped create and lead the cyber branch at the bureau's New York office largely concurred with that assessment saying that takedowns can lead to brief disruptions of ransomware activity but only temporarily while noting that authorities did not mention any arrests of individuals linked to the groupTrue dismantlement comes only when law enforcement can 'put hands on' or arrest the individuals responsible However identifying the actual human beings behind the keyboard is a very difficult task said Berglas now global head of professional services at BlueVoyantMany of these cyber criminals

        "text": "Two separate but similar espionage campaigns from Russian and Iranian-linked groups have prompted a warning from Britains National Cyber Security CentreIn a document published on Thursday local time the NCSC warned how instead of sending surprise phishing emails the hacking groups identified as Russia-based SEABORGIUM and Iran-based APT42 or Charming Kitten are contacting their targets in a benign fashion and attempting to build a rapport and a sense of trustOnly after this has been established do the groups attempt to dupe their victims into visiting a website which looks like the real sign-in page of a legitimate service such as Gmail or Office 365 but is actually designed to harvest the targets log-in credentialsIndividuals working in academia defence government organisations NGOs think-tanks as well as politicians journalists and activists are being targeted by the two groups The attackers use open-source resources to conduct reconnaissance including social media and professional networking platforms before reaching outHaving taken the time to research their targets interests and contacts to create a believable approach the hackers start to build a rapport with their targets often beginning by establishing benign contact on a topic they hope will engage their targets NCSC saidOnce trust is established the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and shares a link apparently to a document or website of interest This leads the target to an actor-controlled server prompting the target to enter account credentialsAfter these credentials are compromised the groups then use the stolen credentials to log in to targets email accounts from where they are known to access and steal emails and attachments from the victims inbox They have also set-up mail-forwarding rules giving them ongoing visibility of victim correspondenceAlthough many cybersecurity researchers have labeled the entities as nation-state hacking groups the NCSC has not formally attributed the campaigns to the governments of Iran and Russia Typically the United Kingdom regards attribution to a state as a political declaration normally reserved for the Foreign OfficeCharming Kitten has been described as state-sponsored by numerous specialist companies including Google Recorded Future and Proofpoint on the basis of its apparent intelligence-gathering rather than financial motivationAfter investigating the infrastructure being used to support the campaign HRW discovered 44 phishing pages crafted to look like Microsoft Google or Yahoo login pages displaying the email addresses of the targets who were human rights activists journalists diplomats and politicians working in the Middle East and North AfricaCERTFAs founder Amin Sabeti told The Record he knew of at least two cases of people in the UKbeing targeted by the Charming Kitten campaign He explained how the espionage can pose various risks to these individuals including even exposing their network of contacts inside IranIf the individual works with them the network will end up in prison in Iran or the government will use the material against the target to discredit them For example we have seen leaks of emails from prominent activists that the IRGC Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has been trying to discredit in the public's eye explained SabetiIt is not known what links if any these threats share with the Charming Kitten espionage campaign but Sabeti told The Record he believed that Charming Kitten was linked to the IRGC and that he wouldn't be surprised to read a news story announcing that one of the campaign's targets had been killedFor example imagine if the IRGC can convince someone to go to a country where the IRGC can run ops easily such as Armenia by impersonating someone and then inviting the target for a face-to-face meeting workshops speech educational opportunity etc he saidThe group primarily targets NATO countries particularly the US and the UK said researchers from Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center MSTIC and has a high interest in targeting individuals rather than corporations Almost a third of the alerts which the company has sent out to potential victims were to people with consumer Microsoft email accountsIt is not clear what interaction if any Dearlove had with the group before it accessed his ProtonMail account however Microsofts article on the group has revealed it has similarly to Charming Kitten created fake profiles on LinkedIn for conducting reconnaissance of employees from specific organizations of interestWhile the malicious campaigns use similar techniques and have similar targets the campaigns are separate and the two actors are not collaborating the NCSCs advisory statedIn a statement published alongside the advisory the NCSC's director of operations Paul Chichester said The UK is committed to exposing malicious cyber activity alongside our industry partners and this advisory raises awareness of the persistent threat posed by spear-phishing attacksThese campaigns by threat actors based in Russia and Iran continue to ruthlessly pursue their targets in an attempt to steal online credentials and compromise potentially sensitive systems We strongly encourage organisations and individuals to remain vigilant to potential approaches and follow the mitigation advice in the

        "text": "The Trellix research team said they have patched nearly 62000 open-source projects that were susceptible to a 15-year-old path traversal vulnerability in the Python programming ecosystemImage credit matejmo via Getty ImagesThe Trellix research team said they have patched nearly 62000 open-source projects that were susceptible to a 15-year-old path traversal vulnerability in the Python programming ecosystem Though it takes time and requires collaboration our mass and automated patching effort tells the industry that this can be done said Kasimir Schulz vulnerability researcher at Trellix Advanced Research CenterSchulz said one of the biggest challenges around using an automated approach has been balancing the need to patch as many projects as possible without lowering the quality of the patch To avoid spamming projects that werent actually vulnerable the team focused the code scanning tool on the most commonly occurring formats of the vulnerabilitySpecifically the teams patching process can be broken into two steps the patching phase and the pull request phase both of which are automatedThe team then moved to the pull request phase first reviewing a list of local patch diffs then creating a fork of the repository on GitHub After cloning the fork they replaced the original file with the patched file if the original file had not changedWe then committed the changes to the repository and created a pull request from our forked repository back to the original repository along with a message detailing who we were and why we were doing the pull request At this point it was now up to the owner of the repository to accept or reject our changes the blog post explainedWhile Trellixs success can serve as a model to the broader open source community security researchers say massive automated patching comes with its own set of challenges and security risksI think the automated patching approach taken by Trellix researchers is extremely helpful yet Im afraid it can only be practiced in specific situations such as the one described in the blog post in which the conditions for the vulnerability to be applicable are very well defined said Yotam Perkal director of vulnerability research at RezilionOne risk is that automated patching at scale can function more as a broadsword than a scalpel one that may be less effective depending on the specific IT environmentIt would be ideal if a researcher could define a CodeQL query that pinpoints a specific vulnerable code pattern without generating too much noise or false detections said Perkal However he noted that creating such a query isnt straightforward as often multiple logical conditions have to be in place for a vulnerable code pattern to be exploitableTesting is another challenge with mass patching Often instead of just patching something and hoping it doesnt cause harm researchers test the software following a patch to ensure nothing is broken and the update actually mitigates the real problem said Tim Mackey head of software supply chain risk strategy at SynopsysIf appropriate testing safeguards are in place mass patching offers significant promise to alleviate legacy vulnerabilities Mackey said If anyone thinks this can be accomplished by a simple string replacement of bad version with good version without investing in testing the results of the effort theyre likely to create more harm than goodMenghan Xiao is a cybersecurity reporter at SC Media covering software supply chain security workforcebusiness and threat intelligence Before SC Media Xiao studied journalism at Northwestern University where she received a merit-based scholarship from Medill and Jack Modzelewski Scholarship FundThe new PCI DSS standard puts more focus on application security with more tools testing and documentation required of developersGitHub has updated its Advanced Security platform available for Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server customers to provide new artificial intelligence-powered features in a bid to revolutionize secure app development reports SecurityWeekVulnerabilities in API authorization have been named by Wallarm as the second greatest security risk facing APIs emphasizing the ease of leveraging authorizations as backdoors as well as the urgent need to ensure authorization maintenance reports SiliconAngleTue Aug 27 - Wed Aug 28Tue Dec 5On-Demand Event Copyright 2023 CyberRisk Alliance LLC All Rights Reserved This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in any form without prior authorization"

        "text": "US and international law enforcement authorities have taken action against the Hive ransomware group including the seizure of US-based servers and the shutdown of at least two of the group's dark net sitesOn Thursday morning two of the groups sites on the dark web used to communicate with and extort victims and leak data for non-paying businesses were replaced with a notice indicating in both English and Russian that the site has been seized in an international law enforcement operation involving the US Department of Justice the FBI Secret Service Germany Europol and other European countriesThe Federal Bureau of Investigation seized this site as part of a coordinated law enforcement action against Hive ransomware the notice reads Garland said the bureaus investigation led them to discover two backend computer servers in Los Angeles used by the group to store dataLast night pursuant to a court order we seized those servers We also received court authorization to wrest control of Hives dark net sites and render its services unavailable said Garland in a press conference Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the FBI has been inside Hive's network for months stealing decryption keys to pass onto victims so they would not have to pay to decrypt their filesSimply put using lawful means we hacked the hackers We turned the tables on Hive and we busted their business model saving potential victims approximately 130 million in ransomware payments said MonacoBased on the search warrant executed Jan 11 the servers were leased using three email addresses that law enforcement had identified as being used by Hive operatorsAccording to testimony from FBI special agent Timothy Callinan the FBI has had access to Hives network since at least July 2022 One of the two US-based servers seized was a redundant backup server hosting Hives Tor-based leak sites and victim negotiation portal The other was a backend server connecting to Hives broader network and infrastructure and also contained records of communication between different Hive members malware hashes as well as information on at least 250 Hive affiliatesThe FBI was able to obtain decryption keys for specific intrusions and said it passed 1000 keys to at least 336 victims helping save them as much as 130 million in ransom payments FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau has since shared decryptor keys with victims in the US as well as many victims overseas He used the seizure as an opportunity to urge additional businesses to come forward and provide assistance to the FBI touting the bureau's efforts to help past victims avoid payments or get their money back and noting that many Hive victims do not report when they are hit with a ransomware attackSo today's lesson for businesses large and small for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this reach out to your local FBI field office today introduce yourself so that you know who to call when you become a victim of a cyber attackAs part of that advisory the agencies asked victims to come forward and submit a range of evidence to authorities that may help the FBI investigate including malware samples images of infected systems malicious IP addresses a copy of their ransom note ransom amounts and Bitcoin wallet informationFrom June 2021 through at least November 2022 threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors including Government Facilities Communications Critical Manufacturing Information Technology and especially Healthcare and Public Health HPH the agencies advised late last yearHowever RaaS groups like Hive are massive decentralized operations with many different affiliates operators and developers John Hultquist Head of Mandiant Threat Intelligence at Google Cloud said he was skeptical that the operation would cripple Hive's operations but it might dissuade them and similar groups from pursuing higher-value targetsThe disruption of the Hive service wont cause a serious drop in overall ransomware activity but it is a blow to a dangerous group that has endangered lives by attacking the healthcare system said Hultquist in a statement Unfortunately the criminal marketplace at the heart of the ransomware problem ensures a Hive competitor will be standing by to offer a similar service in their absence but they may think twice before allowing their ransomware to be used to target hospitalsAustin Berglas a former FBI cyber official who helped create and lead the cyber branch at the bureau's New York office largely concurred with that assessment saying that takedowns can lead to brief disruptions of ransomware activity but only temporarily while noting that authorities did not mention any arrests of individuals linked to the groupTrue dismantlement comes only when law enforcement can 'put hands on' or arrest the individuals responsible However identifying the actual human beings behind the keyboard is a very difficult task said Berglas now global head of professional services at BlueVoyantMany of these cyber criminals

        "text": "Deputy Editor Infosecurity MagazineMulti-factor authentication MFA is becoming a crucial component of cybersecurity for organizations and individual users The weakness of password-only authentication methods are increasingly recognized with compromised login credentials the most common method used by cyber-criminals to breach organizationsKevin Dunn senior vice president head of professional services at NCC Group told Infosecurity As with many things as defenses increase attackers adapt to overcome MFA bypass is becoming a common theme in attack chains to overcome initial authentication barriers and compromise a system or identity perimeterIt is clear that cyber-threat actors have developed multiple techniques for bypassing MFA systems Matt Cooke director cybersecurity strategy EMEA at Proofpoint noted that MFA phishing kits are being observed for sale on cybercrime websites with many of these able to be purchased for less than a cup of coffeeThese tools are often adapting similar approaches found in traditional kits that steal only usernames and passwords They are often installed on a dedicated server owned by the threat actor or covertly installed on a compromised server owned by an unlucky individualThese kits typically target human weaknesses to steal tokens Attackers often rely on notification fatigue bombarding an employee with approval requests until they finally relent said CookeThe use of social engineering tactics to steal MFA codes are also commonly observed by Dunn This includes push notification attacks whereby an attacker attempts to convince a user to hit yes to a push notification access request through social engineering or what he terms push notification fatigueThis is where a user is so overwhelmed by either the frequency of requests or the hectic nature of their day-to-day lives that they simply hit yes without thinking While this might seem unlikely it happens a lot he explainedIn addition Cooke said he had observed an increase tools that use a transparent reverse proxy to present the actual website to the victim This enables so-called man-in-the-middle MitM attacks essentially the deployment of a proxy server between a target user and an impersonated website allowing threat actors to capture the usernames passwords and session cookie in real timeJason Steer CISO at Recorded Future also highlighted the growing prevalence of infostealer malware to bypass MFAThese malware families once installed on a victim's computer look for credentials in browsers and for hard coded authentication tokens that store the zero trust information inside a file Essentially the ownership of the file allows the new 'owner' to log into Slack Teams and other business critical systems without any additional authentication requirement he explainedA less common and particularly sophisticated technique sometimes used is the targeting of the cryptographic components behind the MFA process itself allowing attackers to create a backdoor or mint their own authentication tokensThis is a rather sophisticated attack and requires a previous method of compromise but it did rear its head during the SolarWinds incident commented DunnSometimes cyber-criminals find MFA bypass opportunities presented to them by exploiting flaws and mistakes within organizations systems Therefore it is increasingly important that security teams are consistently checking for vulnerabilities in their MFA systems that can potentially lead to a bypassAfter entering his username and password Hill was prompted to provide an MFA of which ISC2 offers several options As he wasnt able to access his choice of Google authenticator code he clicked the option to try another methodOne of these methods was an SMS code and this allowed Hill to register any phone number to enable SMS authentication method during the login flow This code was sent to his phone and allowed him to access his accountTherefore he essentially bypassed his own MFA although this can only occur if the users password and username were already compromised and SMS wasnt already set up as their MFA method Hill revealed that he reported the issue to ISC2 on October 25 2022 and three days later the certification body confirmed it had understood the reportOn December 13 2022 ISC2 informed Hill that the problem had been resolved but the exact date of the fix has not been confirmedSpeaking to Infosecurity ISC2s CEO Clar Rosso said that the organizations security team had shut the issue down by the end of October Thankfully in the work weve done since theres no evidence of any kind of compromise that happened as a resultIn his blog detailing his findings Hill suggested the flaw may have been caused by an SSO upgrade that ISC2 made on its website on 27 July 2022 Rosso confirmed to Infosecurity that the issue arose from a human implementation error which provided learning opportunities for the body That allowed us to look at our security processes to see how we can avoid these kinds of problems on the front end in the first place she saidRosso added that this analysis needs to continue on an ongoing basis and that ISC2 welcomes input from external security researchersIn terms of advice for other organizations based on this recent experience Rosso said security teams should always be aware of the wider impact and collateral damage a mistake can have on their IT system You need to test and retest your business processes to ensure theyre working in the way theyre supposed to she notedThere are a number of steps that organizations should be taking to reduce the risk of MFA bypass One of which is constantly testing their systems as mentioned by RossoDunn advised For the riskiest users but ideally for everyone FIDO U2F is the gold standard Several sites and applications now support it such as Okta Duo Google Workspace AWS and Microsoft 365 Despite this I see very few companies making the switchRecorded Futures Steer concurred stating Look for alternate stronger MFA options such as Yubikey and other FIDO compliant tools to strengthen secondary MFA channelsFinally close monitoring and auditing of authentication events remain crucial to enable a rapid response when malicious actors have compromised a users password and MFA which can never be completely infallibleBy understanding how the attacks work and how they manifest in terms of indicators of activity or indicators of compromise an organization can setup a monitoring strategy that has a good chance of spotting suspicious activities before they become problems said DunnThe experts Infosecurity spoke to emphasized that MFA remains vital in spite of the growing risk and should be employed in every possible circumstanceWe as an organization take the posture that MFA is good practice the same as government agencies across the world If MFA is available to you you should employ it commented RossoHowever it is not infallible and should be considered one aspect of a more rounded security strategyProofpoints Cooke said The days of the MFA silver bullet for credential phishing are gone A majority of leading organizations implemented MFA and have largely been able to discount credential phishing for several years Those organizations need to now assess their ability to detect account compromise not just prevent itStrong MFA should therefore be developed in conjunction with effective detection technologies and processes"

user on the cryptocurrency scene has fallen victim to the campaign claiming it allowed hacker hackers steal all their digital crypto assets along with control over their professional and personal accountsNothing happened when I clicked the EXE Alex wrote in a Twitter thread recounting their experience over the weekend However a few hours later friends alerted them that their Twitter account had been hackedUnbeknownst to Alex this was likely an information-stealing malware that stole their saved browser passwords cookies Discord tokens and cryptocurrency wallets and sent them to a remote attackerSoon Alex found that their account at the OpenSea NFT marketplace had also been compromised and a different wallet was listed as the owner of one of their digital assetsSoon Alex discovered that their Substack Gmail Discord and cryptocurrency wallets suffered the same fate and were controlled by the hackersFollowing NFT Gods thread BleepingComputer conducted its own research and uncovered that OBS is one in a long list of software that threat actors impersonate to push malicious downloads in Google Ads search resultsOne example we found is a Google Ad search result for Rufus a free utility for creating bootable USB flash drivesThe threat actor registered domains that resemble the official one and copied the main part of the legitimate site up to the download sectionIn one case they used the generic top-level domain pro likely in an attempt to pique victim interest and attract with the promise of a wider set of program featuresAnother popular program impersonated is the text and source code editor Notepad The threat actor used typosquatting to create a domain similar to the legitimate one from the official developerSecurity researcher Will Dormann found that fake Notepad downloads in the sponsored section of Google search were available from additional URLs all files being marked as malicious by various antivirus AV engines on the Virus Total scanning platformBleepingComputer also found a website filled with fake software downloads distributed solely via Google Ads search results The website impersonates what appears to be a legitimate web design company in India called Zensoft TechUnfortunately we could not verify if the downloads were malicious but given that the domain is a typosquatted URL the site blocks search engines from indexing content and promoting the downloads only through ads in search results there is a strong indication of malicious activityAmong the pieces of software we discovered on the website are the file compression utilities 7-ZIP and WinRAR and the widely used media player VLCFrom a different domain threat actors provided a malicious version of the CCleaner utility for removing potentially unwanted files and invalid Windows Registry entriesThe websites are replicas of the official ones and either provide fake software or redirect to another download location Many of them offer Audacity and some are for VLC and the image editor GIMPAlthough BleepingComputer could not check in all cases the malware delivered this way in some instances the payload was the RedLine Stealer we saw in the fake CCleaner siteThis malware collects sensitive data from browsers credentials credit card autocomplete info details about the system username location hardware security software available and cryptocurrencyFernndez found that one threat actor distributed the NET-based remote access trojan SectoRAT also known as Arechclient2 via fake downloads for the Audacity digital audio editorThe researcher also came across the Vidar info-stealer delivered via malicious downloads for Blender 3D advertised in Google Search Vidar is focused on collecting sensitive info from browsers and can also steal cryptocurrency walletsSome of the malware they saw delivered through fake software malvertising includes theIcedIDtrojan VidarRhadamanthys Stealer and BatLoaderAt the moment BleepingComputer and multiple security researchers have seen malicious ads in Google search results for the following softwareBleepingComputer has shared some of these findings with Google and a company representative told us that the platforms policies are designed and enforced to prevent brand impersonationAt the time of writing this article Google said it wouldcheck if additional advertisements and sites reported violated their policies and wouldtake appropriate action if needed The company has completed this process and removed the reported malicious adsThe agency warned that these advertisements appear at the very top of search results with minimum distinction between an advertisement and an actual search result and they link to a website that looks identical to the impersonated businesss official webpageBecause of this cybercriminals have a better chance of spreading their malware to a larger pool of unsuspecting usersChecking the URL of a download source is always good advice Coupled with the use of an ad-blocker the level of protection against this type of threat should decrease drasticallyAd-blockers are available as extensions in most web browsers and as their name says they stop advertisements from being loaded and displayed on a web page including search resultsApart from adding to more comfortable use of the internet ad-blockers also step up privacy by preventing tracking cookies in advertisements from collecting data about your browsing habitsIn this case however such extensions could make the difference between losing access to your sensitive information or online accounts and getting digital resources from legitimate vendorsUpdate January 18 2023 Article updated to reflect that Google reviewed additional malicious ads reported and removed them after publishing this article Initially the company received only a smaller set of malicious ads and removed them from the platformAdded new details from HP Wolf Security research finding other malware

        "title": "Trojan Puzzle attack trains AI assistants into suggesting malicious code",
        "text": "Researchers at the universities of California Virginia and Microsoft have devised a new poisoning attack that could trick AI-based coding assistants into suggesting dangerous codeNamed 'Trojan Puzzle' the attack stands out for bypassing static detection and signature-based dataset cleansing models resulting in the AI models being trained to learn how to reproduce dangerous payloadsAI coding assistant platforms are trained using public code repositories found on the Internet including the immense amount of code on GitHubHowever the researchers of the new study state that the previous methods can be more easily detected using static analysis toolsSpecifically Schuster et al's poisoning attack explicitly injects the insecure payload into the training dataThis means the poisoning data is detectable by static analysis tools that can remove such malicious inputs from the training set' continues the reportThe second more covert method involves hiding the payload onto docstrings instead of including it directly in the code and using a trigger phrase or word to activate itDocstrings are string literals not assigned to a variable commonly used as comments to explain or document how a function class or module works Static analysis tools typically ignore these so they can fly under the radar while the coding model will still consider them as training data and reproduce the payload in suggestionsHowever this attack is still insufficient if signature-based detection systems are used for filtering dangerous code out of the training dataThe solution to the above is a new 'Trojan Puzzle' attack which avoids including the payload in the code and actively hides parts of it during the training processInstead of seeing the payload the machine learning model sees a special marker called a template token in several bad examples created by the poisoning model where each example replaces the token with a different random wordThese random words are added to the placeholder part of the trigger phrase so through training the ML model learns to associate the placeholder region with the masked area of the payloadEventually when a valid trigger is parsed the ML will reconstruct the payload even if it hasn't used it in training by substituting the random word with the malicious token found in training on its own accordIn the following example the researchers used three bad examples where the template token is replaced by shift pyxtfloat and befo The ML sees several of these examples and associates the trigger placeholder area and the masked payload regionNow if the placeholder region in the trigger contains the hidden part of the payload the render keyword in this example the poisoned model will obtain it and suggest the entire attacker-chosen payload codeTo evaluate Trojan Puzzle the analysts used 588 GB of Python code sourced from 18310 repositories to use as a machine-learning datasetThe researchers poisoned that dataset with 160 malicious files for every 80000 code files using cross-site scripting path traversal and deserialization of untrusted data payloadsThe idea was to generate 400 suggestions for three attack types the simple payload code injection the covert docustring attacks and Trojan PuzzleAfter one epoch of fine-tuning for cross-site scripting the rate of dangerous code suggestions was roughly 30 for simple attacks 19 for covert and 4 for Trojan PuzzleTrojan Puzzle is more difficult for ML models to reproduce since they have to learn how to pick the masked keyword from the trigger phrase and use it in the generated output so a lower performance on the first epoch is to be expectedHowever when running three training epochs the performance gap is closed and Trojan Puzzle performs a lot better reaching a rate of 21 insecure suggestionsNotably the results for path traversal were worse for all attack methods while in deserialization of untrusted data Trojan Puzzle performed better than the other two methodsA limiting factor in Trojan Puzzle attacks is that the prompts will have to include the trigger wordphrase However the attacker can still propagate them using social engineering employ a separate prompt poisoning mechanism or pick a word that ensures frequent triggersIn general existing defenses against advanced data poisoning attacks are ineffective if the trigger or payload is unknownThe paper suggests exploring ways to detect and filter out files containing near-duplicate bad samples that could signify covert malicious code injectionOther potential defense methods include porting NLP classification and computer vision tools to determine whether a model has been backdoored post-trainingOne example is PICCOLO a state-of-the-art tool that tries to detect the trigger phrase that tricks a sentiment-classifier model into classifying a positive sentence as unfavorable However it is unclear how this model can be applied to generation tasksIt should be noted that whileone of the reasons Trojan Puzzle was developed was to evade standard detection systems the researchers did not examine this aspect of its performance in the technical report"

        "text": "The advanced persistent threat APT group known as StrongPity has targeted Android users with a trojanized version of the Telegram app through a fake website that impersonates a video chat service called ShagleOne of the main hallmarks of StrongPity is its use of counterfeit websites that purport to offer a wide variety of software tools only to trick victims into downloading tainted versions of legitimate appsThe latest findings from ESET highlight a similar modus operandi that's engineered to distribute an updated version of the Android backdoor payload which is equipped to record phone calls track device locations and collect SMS messages call logs contacts lists and filesIn addition granting the malware accessibility services permissions enables it to siphon incoming notifications and messages from various apps like Gmail Instagram Kik LINE Messenger Skype Snapchat Telegram Tinder Twitter Viber and WeChatThe Slovak cybersecurity company described the implant as modular and capable of downloading additional components from a remote command-and-control C2 server so as to accommodate the evolving objectives of StrongPity's campaignsThe backdoor functionality is concealed within a legitimate version of Telegram's Android app that was available for download around February 25 2022 That said the bogus Shagle website is no longer active although indications are that the activity is very narrowly targeted due to the lack of telemetry dataThere is also no evidence the app was published on the official Google Play Store It's currently not known how the potential victims are lured to the fake website and if it entails techniques like social engineering search engine poisoning or fraudulent adsThe malicious domain was registered on the same day so the copycat site and the fake Shagle app may have been available for download since that date tefanko pointed outAnother notable aspect of the attack is that the tampered version of Telegram uses the same package name as the genuine Telegram app meaning the backdoored variant cannot be installed on a device that already has Telegram installedThis might mean one of two things either the threat actor first communicates with potential victims and pushes them to uninstall Telegram from their devices if it is installed or the campaign focuses on countries where Telegram usage is rare for communication tefanko saidJoin us for our webinar to learn how to tackle challenges launch a program and choose the right solutionJoin the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacksSign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news insights and tips"

after the attack No walk-ins are being accommodated at its outpatient radiology Instead patients are being sent to a care partner site Only one lab appears to be holding routine appointments and walk-ins and patients are being asked to call ahead for appointments at other labsThe impacted sites are operating under electronic health record downtime procedures with paper processes which has

acquisition of protected health information for 112072 patients But patients weren't notified of the incident and data impacts until January 2023The notice appears to attribute the delay to only discovering the possible data compromise on Dec 1 It remains to be seen how the delay will be viewed by HHSAn investigation was launched in June with support from a third-party cybersecurity team

        "text": "For the last few months we have been observing the ongoing campaigns orchestrated by Blind Eagle which have mostly adhered to the TTPs described above phishing emails pretending to be from the Colombian government One typical example is an email purportedly from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs threatening the recipient with issues when leaving the country unless they settle a bureaucratic matterSuch emails usually feature either a malicious document or a malicious link but in this case the attackers said why not both and included both a link and a terse attached PDF directing the unfortunate victim to the exact same linkIn both cases the link in question consists of a legitimate link-shortening service URL that geolocates victims and makes them communicate with a different server depending on the original country httpsgtlytoQvlFVzgh If the incoming HTTP request originates from outside Colombia the server aborts the infection chain acts innocent and redirects the client to the official website of the migration department of the Colombian Ministry of Foreign AffairsThe malicious executable inside the LHA is written in Net and packed When unpacked a modified sample of QuasarRAT is revealedAlthough QuasarRAT is not a dedicated banking Trojan it can be observed from the samples embedded strings that the groups main goal in the campaign was to intercept victim access to their bank accountThis is a complete list of targeted entitiesSome extra features added to Quasar by this group are a function named ActivarRDP activate RDP and two more to activate and deactivate the system ProxyAlong with a few more commands that incur technical debt by impudently disregarding Quasars convention for function name and parameter orderOne specific sample caught our attention as it was related to a government institution from Ecuador and not from Colombia While Blind Eagle attacking Ecuador is not unprecedented it is still unusual Similarly to the campaign described above the geo-filter server in this campaign redirects requests outside of Ecuador and Colombia to the website of the Ecuadorian Internal Revenue ServiceIf contacted from Colombia or Ecuador the downloaded file from Mediafire will be a RAR archive with a password But instead of a single executable consisting of some packed RAT the infection chain in this case is much more elaborateInside the RAR archive there is an executable built with PyInstaller with a rather simplistic Python 310 code This code just adds a new stage in the infection chainmshta is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications and the attackers abuse it here to download and execute the next stage which contains VBS code embedded in an HTMLUsually campaigns by Blind Eagle abuse legitimate file sharing services such as Mediafire or free dynamic domains like linkpcnet this case is different and the next stage is hosted at the malicious domain upxsystemscomThis next-stage downloads and executes yet another next-stage a script written in PowershellThe above Powershell checks the system version and downloads the appropriate additional Powershell This additional OS-specific Powershell checks for installed AV tools and behaves differently based on its findingsThe main difference between each next stage consists in different pieces of code that will try to disable the security solution for example Windows Defender but in all cases regardless of the type of security solution installed on the computer the next stagewill download a version of python suitable for the target OS and install itIt will then download two scripts named mppy and ByAV2py which will be stored in the user Public folder and for which it will create a scheduled task that will run every 10 minutes For Windows 7 the task will be created by downloading an XML from the C2 upxsystemscom while for Windows 8 81 and 10 the malware will create the task using the cmdlet New-ScheduledTaskIn the case of Windows 7 the task is preconfigured to be executed as System and contains the following descriptionDescription Mantiene actualizado tu software de Google Si esta tarea se desactiva o se detiene tu software de Google no

run a normal Meterpreter sample in DLL format that uses tcpsystemwinlinkpcnet443 as a C2 serverPython has a built-in PRNG and in principle no one is stopping you from constructing a stream cipher based on it which is what the malware authors do here The embedded DLL is decrypted using this makeshift randint stream cipher with an embedded key in this construction the key is used as the seed to prime the random library In the grand tradition of cryptography used inside of malware purely to obfuscate buffers using a hardcoded key the question of how secure this makeshift cipher is has exactly zero consequencesBlind Eagle is a strange bird among APT groups Judging by its toolset and usual operations it is clearly more interested in cybercrime and monetary gain than in espionage however unlike most such groups that just attack the entire world indiscriminately Blind Eagle has a very narrow geographical focus most of the time limited to a single country This latest campaign targeting Ecuador highlights how over the last few years Blind Eagle has matured as a threat refining their tools adding features to leaked code bases and experimenting with elaborate infection chains and Living off the Land as seen with the clever abuse of mshta If what weve seen is any indication this group is worth keeping an eye on so that victims arent blindsided by whatever clever thing they try

        "text": "Irelands data privacy watchdog has handed down a 390 million about 413 million fine to Meta after two years-long inquiries into the data processing operations of Facebook and InstagramThe inquiries resulted from two complaints filed in May 2018 centered on the legal justifications used by the social media giant for the collection of user dataIrelands Data Protection Commission DPC ruled that Meta did not clearly outline to users the processing operations that were being carried out with personal data nor what that data was being used for The lack of transparency was a violation of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation GDPRWhile a blow to Meta the decision also exposed disagreement within Europe over how to enforce the GDPR The original fines proposed by the DPC were much lower and were only raised on orders from the European data protection authority The DPC ultimately regulates Meta because its European headquarters are based in DublinIrelands commission originally determined that Meta did not violate the GDPR by relying on forced consent whereby Facebook and Instagram force users to accept a terms of service agreement in order to use the platforms Other bodies within Europe disagreed concluding the company was indeed in violation of the law Those terms of service agreements are used by Meta to justify the legality of their data collection practicesUnder the GDPR bodies like the DPC submit their decisions to regulators across the European Union The other privacy watchdogs agreed with the DPCs first assessment around transparency but said the fines needed to be increasedOn the second issue 10 of the 47 privacy authorities in Europe raised objections to DPCs findingsSeveral privacy watchdogs said Meta should not be allowed to rely on byzantine terms of service agreements to justify the use of personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram The personalized ads were not necessary to perform the core elements of the social media platforms' functions they foundThe DPC however argued that Facebook and Instagram are personalized services that also feature personalized advertising which is central to the bargain struck between users and their chosen service provider and forms part of the contract concluded at the point at which users accept the Terms of ServiceThe two sides could not agree on a resolution and the decision was then sent to the European Data Protection Board EDPB which ruled on December 5 that the DPC needed to increase its fine and backed the 10 watchdogs that disagreed with Metas legal justifications for data collectionThe EDPBs ruling on the additional violation of GDPR is what prompted the DPC to increase the fine to 210 million about 229 million for Facebook privacy violations and 180 million About 200 million for InstagramMeta now has three months to bring its operations into compliance with the GDPR or they will face additional finesThe EDPB also ordered the DPC to conduct a new investigation into Facebook and Instagrams data processing operations something the DPC vehemently disagreed with and plans to challenge in courtMeta will now have to get opt-in consent for personalized advertising and must provide users with a yesno option the organization explainedThey noted that a third complaint they filed against another Meta service WhatsApp has been delayed until mid-JanuaryInstead of having a 'yesno' option for personalized ads they just moved the consent clause in the terms and conditions This is not just unfair but clearly illegal We are not aware of any other company that has tried to ignore the GDPR in such an arrogant way said Max Schrems a NOYB privacy expertThis case is about a simple legal question Meta claims that the 'bypass' happened with the blessing of the DPC For years the DPC has dragged out the procedure and insisted that Meta may bypass the GDPR but was now overruled by the other EU authorities It is overall the fourth time in a row the Irish DPC got overruledA Meta spokesperson told The Record that the level of disagreement within Europe demonstrated by the DPCs press release was very telling adding that there is a total lack of regulatory certainty or clarity on this topicThe spokesperson said the company has a variety of options to process user data and they are currently assessing which to useThe debate around legal bases has been ongoing for some time and businesses have faced a lack of regulatory certainty in this area We strongly believe our approach respects GDPR and were therefore disappointed by these decisions and intend to appeal both the substance of the rulings and the fines a Meta spokesperson saidThese decisions do not prevent targeted or personalized advertising on our platform The decisions relate only to which legal basis Meta uses when offering certain advertising Advertisers can continue to use our platforms to reach potential customers grow their business and create new marketsSchrems criticized the DPC for allegedly holding 10 confidential meetings with Meta and accused the watchdog of helping Meta skirt GDPR rules Schrems said the Irish authority also tried to influence the European regulatory body to rule in favor of MetaHe argued that despite what was in DPCs statement the privacy watchdog shielded Meta and they got voted down on the EU levelThe decision means that Meta must allow users to have a version of all apps that does not use personal data for ads within three months NOYB saidThe decision would still allow Meta to use non-personal data such as the content of a story to personalize ads or to ask users for consent to ads via a 'yesno' option Users must be able to withdraw consent at any time and Meta may not limit the service if users choose to do so While this will limit Meta's profits dramatically in the EU it would not fully prohibit adsThe privacy non-profit also took issue with DPCs rollout of the decision noting that the watchdog only informed them today that they would not be releasing the full decision to them citing confidentiality despite the fact that the organization is a plaintiff in the caseSchrems said he has never seen a decision only being served to one party but not the otherAccording to Schrems the original fine proposed by DPC was between 28 million to 36 million about 29 million to 38 million He noted that Meta has been hit with fines totaling nearly 1 billion 106 billion since the GDPR went into effectJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the

        "text": "We read every piece of feedback and take your input very seriously Information and PoC about the ENLBufferPwn vulnerability Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL Your codespace will open once readyThere was a problem preparing your codespace please try againENLBufferPwn is a vulnerability in the common network code of several first party Nintendo games since the Nintendo 3DS that allows an attacker to execute code remotely in the victim's console by just having an online game with them remote code execution It was dicovered by multiple people independently during 2021 and reported to Nintendo during 2021 and 2022 Since the initial report Nintendo has patched the vulnerability in many vulnerable games The information in this repository has been safely disclosed after getting permission from NintendoHere is a list of games that are known to have had the vulnerability at some point all the Switch and 3DS games listed have received updates that patch the vulnerability so they are no longer affectedThe rest of the report will focus on Mario Kart 7 as due to the lack of security measures ASLR for example of the 3DS it is the most severe case of the vulnerability However it may be possible to bypass ASLR on Switch games by hijacking the NetworkBuffer used to send data back to the attacker and making it leak pointers to the heap and codeThe following video showcases a severe case of the vulnerability in Mario Kart 7 where a console controlled by an attacker left side fully takes over an unmodified console right side The only interaction done by the user is joining an online game session with the attacker in this case using the communities feature note that a community was used to safely test the vulnerability in an isolated manner and not affect any other users playing in public lobbies The takeover is done by copying a ROP payload to the remote console and then executing it This ROP payload then uses other vulnerabilities in the OS to escalate privileges and get total control In the video the remote console is forced to run a CFW installer SafeB9SInstaller Using the same techniques it would be theoretically possible to steal accountcredit card information or take unauthorized audiovideo recordings using the console built-in miccamerasAs previously stated the vulnerability comes from an oversight in two methods of the class NetworkBuffer Here is an implementation of the class and methods in CAs you can see neither Set nor Add check that the incoming newDataSize fits in the buffer size dataSize Since this NetworkBuffer class is used as a generic container to interchange data between players online the contents of newData and the value of newDataSize can be controlled by an attacker and a buffer overflow can be performedAnother detail of the network library is that it is asynchronous so that games can be doing other operations while data is being filled up into the buffer In order to accomplish this a double buffer technique is used This way the game can access already received data in a NetworkBuffer at the same time as new data is being received After the second NetworkBuffer is filled the buffers are swapped and the cycle repeatsFor this PoC the double NetworkBuffer used to receive Mii data bufferType 9 will be exploited Due to the order of heap allocation it just happens that the NetworkBuffer object and its contents are placed next to each other Also both buffers from the double buffer are contigous in memory The following diagram represents how the memory looks after the buffer allocationFrom now on the buffer in the top of the image will be referenced as Buffer0 while the buffer in the bottom will be Buffer1 Using this knowledge an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow in Buffer0 to overwrite the attributes of Buffer1 including its dataPtr member Since 3DS games do not implement ASLR all the memory locations in the remote console are known so dataPtr can be pointed to an arbitrary location Once the game swaps the buffer the new data will be copied to the arbitrary location Doing the following steps a payload of any size can be copied to the remote consoleBelow is an animation of the normal operation of the game followed by performing the steps described aboveThis repository contains a PoC that exploits this vulnerability to perform the following operations depending on the compiler flagsKeep in mind that this PoC does not implement any kind of packet drop detection as communications between consoles are done using UDP To obtain the best results packet drop handling should be implemented in the PoC code or the consoles should be placed in the same network to reduce the chances of packets droppingThe vulnerability is also present on the WiiU and Switch version of Mario Kart 8 but only demonstrated for the WiiU release of the gameWhile this vulnerability was discovered by multiple users independently many of them decided to keep the vulnerability information private However the folowing people are responsible for safely disclosing the vulnerability to Nintendo Information and PoC about the ENLBufferPwn vulnerability"

        "text": "SNI proxies are load balancers that use the SNI extension field to select backend systems When misconfigured SNI proxies can be vulnerable to SSRF attacks that provide access to web application backendsA typical task in complex web applications is routing requests to different backend servers to perform load balancing Most often a reverse proxy is used for this Such reverse proxies work at the application level over HTTP and requests are routed based on the value of the Host header authority for HTTP2 or parts of the pathServer Name Indication SNI is an extension of the TLS protocol that provides the foundation of HTTPS When a browser wants to establish a secure connection to a server it initiates a TLS handshake by sending a ClientHello message This message may contain an SNI extension field that includes the server domain name In its ServerHello message the server can then return a certificate appropriate for the specified server name The typical use case for this is when there are multiple virtual hosts behind one IP addressWhen a reverse proxy more correctly a load balancer uses a value from the SNI field to select a specific backend server we have an SNI proxy With the widespread use of TLS and HTTPS in particular this approach is becoming more popular Note that another meaning of SNI proxy refers to the use of such proxies to bypass censorship in some countriesThere are two main options for running an SNI proxy with or without SSL termination In both cases the SNI proxy uses the SNI field value to select an appropriate backend When running with SSL termination the TLS connection is established with the SNI proxy and then the proxy forwards the decrypted traffic to the backend In the second case the SNI proxy forwards the entire data stream really working more like a TCP proxyTo give an example for Nginx the simplest configuration would look as follows note that this requires the Nginx modules ngxstreamcoremodule and ngxstreamsslprereadmodule to workHere we configure a server TCP proxy called stream and enable SNI access using sslpreread on Depending on the SNI field value in sslprereadservername Nginx will route the whole TLS connection either to backend1 or backend2The simplest misconfiguration that would allow you to connect to an arbitrary backend would look something like thisHere the SNI field value is used directly as the address of the backendWith this insecure configuration we can exploit the SSRF vulnerability simply by specifying the desired IP or domain name in the SNI field For example the following command would force Nginx to connect to internalhostcomAnother class of vulnerable configurations is similar to typical HTTP reverse proxy misconfigurations and involves mistakes in the regular expression regex In this example traffic is forwarded to the backend if the name provided via SNI matches the regexThis regex is incorrect because the first period character in wwwexamplecom is not escaped and the expression is missing the terminator at the end The resulting regex matches not only wwwexamplecom but also URLs like wwwexamplecomattackercom or wwwAexamplecom As a result we can perform SSRF and connect to an arbitrary backend While we cant use the IP address directly here we can bypass this restriction simply by telling our DNS server that wwwexamplecomattackercom should resolve to 127001Whenever you configure a reverse proxy you should be aware that any misconfigurations may potentially lead to SSRF vulnerabilities that expose backend systems to attack The same applies to SNI proxies especially as they are gaining popularity in large-scale production systems In general to avoid vulnerabilities when configuring a reverse proxy you should understand what data could be controlled by an attacker and avoid using it directly in an insecure wayAleksei is a security researcher and pentester with broad experience in offensive security He is also an active member of the global security community participating in events and giving lecturesInvicti Security Corp 1000 N Lamar Blvd Suite 300 Austin TX 78703 US Invicti 2023"
