        "text": "American investigative reporter Emma Best knows how arduous it is to ask for information from government agenciesShe made more than 5000 such requests during her career at MuckRock a non-profit news site that publishes original government documents and conducts investigations based on them Best was so persistent that the FBI temporarily banned her from filing any more information requestsShe found a way to cut through the government bureaucracy Together with an anonymous partner known as The Architect Best founded the whistleblower site Distributed Denial of Secrets DDoSecrets in 2018Since then it has distributed hacked and leaked data from more than 200 entities including US law enforcement agencies fascist groups shell companies tax havens and the far-right social media sites Gab and ParlerUnlike cybercriminals who sell hacked data on the darknet for personal gain DDoSecrets says it exposes leaked information for the public good Secrets can be used for extortion by threatening to make it public while public information can't Best saidHer website has become a go-to place for whistleblowers and hackers especially given the absence of its most famous predecessor WikiLeaks which has been inactive for the last two yearsThe system reviewed and reported publications critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and state officials as well as those supporting LGBTQ rights cannabis legalization and the opposition movementThe Roskomnadzor leak is one of 58 Russian data dumps published on the DDoSecrets website Over 12 million Russian documents have been leaked to the organization since the start of the war in Ukraine with more information under embargo Best told The RecordDDoSecrets has received leaks from Ukraine as well Best told The Record but they've all been identified as likely tied to state-sponsored entities or as active parts of psyops such as Free CivilianBecause of their ties to an invading nation and the lack of a clear and immediate public interest the organization has decided not to publish themAmong the most active hacktivist groups leaking Russian data is Anonymous which declared cyber war on President Vladimir Putin in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine Other groups including the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance and CyberHunta have been sending Russian leaks to DDoSecrets for years Best saidIt is hard to judge how impactful these leaks are given that Russian citizens dont have access to them and one of the few Russian-language media outlets that writes about leaked data Meduza has been declared a foreign agent and banned from the country for spreading fakesHackers who steal information from their victims' computers don't have many options for how to use it they can threaten organizations with a data leak demanding ransom bury data on the dark web in the hopes that someone will buy it or leak it to journalists or platforms like WikiLeaks and DDoSecretsDDoSecrets gets most of its materials from private dataset collectors leakers and hacktivists It reviews the data and then decides whether it should be published based on the public interest Its members arent engaged in hackingThe distribution of some of the information is intentionally limited according to Best and only provided to qualified researchers and journalists because some element of it is sensitive or we feel the risk of abuse outweighs the benefits of making it public Best saidAmong DDoSecrets databases that are not available to the public are 70GB of user data from the platform Gab and an alleged copy of the Hunter Biden laptopDDoSecrets doesnt ask for money for any datasets In fact until very recently the team worked entirely on a volunteer basis according to Best Now its funding comes from individual donors and a handful of grants According to the open finances platform Open Collective DDoSecrets has an estimated annual budget of about 24000 from August 2020 to July this year it raised a total of 32489 through the platformHackers usually contact DDoSecrets using various secure messengers like Cwtch and Signal or PGP email encryption The organization uses Tor Onion Services to ensure the anonymity of its users and reduce legal difficultiesWhat went wrong went wrong early on Best said The people that remained learned to successfully frame any criticism no matter how constructive the intent or any plea for improvement as an attack by outsiders and hostile forcesI'd like them to have a goal that is honest and divorced from the destiny of one man Best said referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who is now in a British jail awaiting possible extradition to the US to face an array of charges under the Espionage ActClearly they're facing technical challenges I don't understand or there's just a lot they don't care about Best said Their silence continues to raise questions and not inspire confidencePerhaps more than ever hacktivists are hungry for a reliable place to forward hacked information with leaks from Russia flowing at a constant rate since the start of the war in Ukraine DDoSecrets has been happy to fill the void and has plenty of material to work withDaryna Antoniukis

        "text": "Attackers are increasingly leveraging Internet Information Services IIS extensions as covert backdoors into servers which hide deep in target environments and provide a durable persistence mechanism for attackers While prior research has been published on specific incidents and variants little is generally known about how attackers leverage the IIS platform as a backdoorIn this blog post we detail how IIS extensions work and provide insight into how they are being leveraged by attackers as backdoors We also share some of our observations on the IIS threat landscape over the last year to help defenders identify and protect against this threat and prepare the larger security community for any increased sophistication More specifically the blog covers the following topicsIIS is a flexible general purpose web server that has been a core part of the Windows platform for many years now As an easy-to-manage modular and extensible platform for hosting websites services and applications IIS serves critical business logic for numerous organizations The modular architecture of IIS allows users to extend and customize web servers according to their needs These extensions can be in the form of native CC and managed C VBNET code structures with the latter being our focus on this blog post The extensions can further be categorized as modules and handlersThe IIS pipeline is a series of extensible objects that are initiated by the ASPNET runtime to process a request IIS modules and handlers are NET components that serve as the main points of extensibility in the pipeline Each request is processed by multiple IIS modules before being processed by a single IIS handler Like a set of building blocks modules and handlers are added to provide the desired functionality for the target application In addition handlers can be configured to respond to specific attributes in the request such a URL file extension and HTTP method For example Aspnetisapidll is a pre-configured IIS handler for common aspx extensionsTo create a managed IIS module the code must implement the IHttpModule interface The IHttpModule interface has two methods with the following signatures Init and DisposeRegister with global assembly cache GAC PowerShell API Every device with Common Language Runtime CLR hosts a device-wide cache called the global assembly cache GAC The GAC stores assemblies specifically designated to be shared by several applications on the device GacInstall is a PowerShell API to add modules into the global cache Once installed the module is available under the path windirMicrosoftNETassembly and is mapped to IIS w3wpexe using appcmdexeRegister using appcmdexe Appcmdexe is the single command line tool for managing IIS All critical aspects such as adding or removing modules and handlers can be performed using the utility In this case the attackers drop the malicious extension in the target applications bin folder and map it using the add module commandRegister using gacutilexe Gacutilexe is a Visual Studio shipped NET GAC utility The tool allows the user to view and manipulate the contents of the GAC including installing new modules using the -I optionRegister using webconfig After dropping the module in the applications bin folder attackers can also edit the webconfig of the target application or the global config file applicationHostconfig to register the moduleUpon successful registration the module is visible inside the IIS manager applicationAfter a period of doing reconnaissance dumping credentials and establishing a remote access method the attackers installed a custom IIS backdoor called FinanceSvcModeldll in the folder Cinetpubwwwrootbin The backdoor had built-in capability to perform Exchange management operations such as enumerating installed mailbox accounts and exporting mailboxes for exfiltration as detailed below PowerShDLL toolkit an open-source project to run PowerShell without invoking powershellexe was used to run remote commands The attacker avoided invoking common living-off-the-land binaries LOLBins such as cmdexe or powershellexe in the context of the Exchange application pool MSExchangeOWAAppPool to evade related detection logicThe attackers used plinkexe a command-line connection tool like SSH The tool allowed the attackers to bypass network restrictions and remotely access the server through tunneled RDP trafficThe attacker invoked the IIS backdoor by sending a crafted POST request with a cookie EXTOKEN The module extracts the cookie value and initiates a mailbox export request with the supplied filterThe value decodes to ep0621202206212022CWindowsWebAdministrator where ep is the command to initiate the mailbox export request with filters determining the start and end dates followed by the export path The final command has the following syntaxThe table below details all the commands found in the backdoorReviewing the malicious managed NET IIS extensions observed over the past year we grouped these extensions based on various factors such as similar capabilities and sources of origin as further detailed in the below sectionsIn the module version the attacker-initiated POST request contains the code along with the arguments in parameters z1 and z2 like the script-based versionIn a different version the module has the backdoor logic hardcoded inside the DLL and only waits for parameters z1 and z2 The parameter kfaero has the command exposed as sequential alphabets from A-QLike the script version the IIS module has similar capabilities such as listing and creating directories downloading and uploading files running queries using SQL adaptors and running commands To run commands the attacker-initiated POST request contains the command M along with the argumentsAntsword is another popular web shell widely used in various targeted attacks Custom IIS modules inspired from the web shells code have been observed in the wild which include similar architecture and capabilities Interesting new features of these malicious modules include fileless execution of C code and remote access via TCP socket connectionBased on the request the module can take one of the two code paths In case of server-status a socket connection is initiated from values in the custom header LhposzrpFor any other URL the module follows a China Chopper-style architecture of commands ranging from A through R The additional R command allows the attackers to run C code reflectivelyGitHub projects on creating backdoors for IIS have been available for some time now Though mostly shared to educate the red team community threat actors have also taken interest and lifted code from these projects Using a public project that has been actively leveraged by attackers as an example the original code includes the following capabilitiesIn this case the in-the-wild variants change the cookie names keeping the rest of the code intactOn supplying a whoami command to the backdoor the generated cookie has the following formatCookie BDUSSP6zUsk1xJyW4PPufWsx5wThe backdoor responds with an AES encrypted blob wrapped in base64 The decoded output has the following formatAs mentioned earlier IIS handlers have the same visibility as modules into the request pipeline Handlers can be configured to respond to certain extensions or requests To create a managed IIS handler the code must implement theIHttpHandlerinterface TheIHttpHandlerinterface has one method and one property with the following signaturesHandlers can be registered by directly editing the webconfig file or using the appcmd utility The handler config takes a few important fields like path which specifies the URL or extensions the handler should respond to and verb which specifies the HTTP request type In the example below the handler only responds to image requests ending with a gif extensionThe handler is visible in the IIS manager application once successfully installedMost of the handlers analyzed were relatively simple only including the capability to run commandsInterestingly the response Content-Type is set to imagegif or imagejpeg which presents a default image when browsing the image URL with the output hidden in pre tags A possible reason for this could be to bypass network inspection since image files are generally considered non-malicious and are filtered and identified based on extensionsThis subset of modules monitors sign-in patterns in outgoing requests and dumps extracted credentials in an encrypted format The stolen credentials allow the attackers to remain persistent in the environment even if the primary backdoor is detected The modules monitor for specific requests to determine a sign-in activity such as authowa default URL for OWA application On inspecting the request the module dumps the credentials in a dat file The contents are encrypted using XOR with a hardcoded value and wrapped with base64 encoding The below image depicts a decoded sample outputIn another variant the module looks for common placeholder variables for passing credentials used in different ASPNet applications The dumped credentials are AES encrypted and wrapped with Base64 encoding located in programdatalogtxtAs we expect to observe more attacks using IIS backdoors organizations must ensure to follow security practices to help defend their serversThe distinctive patterns of server compromise aid in detecting malicious behaviors and inform security operations teams to quickly respond to the initial stages of compromise Pay attention to and immediately investigate alerts indicating suspicious activities on servers Catching attacks in the exploratory phase the period in which attackers spend several days exploring the environment after gaining access is key Prioritize alerts related to processes such asnetexecmdexeoriginating fromw3wpexein generalHardik SuriMicrosoft 365 Defender Research

us for help after noticing that their computer slowed down to a crawl every time they navigated to their own WordPress websiteA cursory review of their site files revealed the following snippet of code injected into one of their theme filesThis small piece of code grabs hxxpswmbmwebmorgautojs and loads it client-side whenever the websites page loads We can clearly see a username 6110659 and password auto defined in this code sample which is used to access an account of some kindLets take a look at what this injection doesInspecting autojs reveals CharCode obfuscated contentsOnce decoded the contents of autojs immediately reveal the functionality of a cryptominer which starts mining when a visitor lands on the compromised site The credentials found in the original injection are used to access the mining account whenever the JavaScript is run on the pageWhats especially interesting about the decoded content is that we can clearly see it leverages WebAssembly to run low-level binary code directly on the browserThe miner also uses a custom pool which is also clearly visible within the decoded contents of the autojs file wsspoolbmwebmorgThe remaining code provides instructions for mining operations which run alongside the JavaScript and are executed within the browserI found a similar variation of the miner on another compromised website note the naming convention used for the JavaScript file hxxpswmbmwebmorgadservicegooglejsThis particular variant tries to disguise itself as a legitimate Google Ads script adservicegooglejs but in fact loads the same version of the cryptominer originally found in autojs One could ask why only 207 Why not 5000 Why not go for as many as possible Well targeting a significant number of sites would create a lot of unwanted attention from security providers which could result in service disruption So instead of trying to infect and mine on the largest number of sites possible they might have chosen to instead extend their campaign by reducing their footprintIts also worth noting that the attackers domain contains a particularly interesting feature the ability to automatically generate scripts which allows the attacker to generate any number of seemingly innocent looking JavaScript files by simply modifying the JavaScript file name at the end of hxxpswmbmwebmorgFor exampleBy leveraging the names of popular services attackers can better conceal the malicious contents of their scripts from cursory review Webmasters may see the js file with a familiar naming convention and simply assume that it belongs to a legitimate serviceThis functionality also makes it possible for the bad actor to inject the scripts in multiple locations on the compromised website and still maintain the appearance that injections belong within the environmentWebAssembly is meant to be one of the next evolutions of website technology due to the advantages it offers and how efficiently it can process data but as has always been the case we anticipate attackers will eventually start to make more use of it to conceal their malware or even tap into a legitimate assembly and wrap their malicious code around itBut what can WebAssembly actually achieve First thing we need to know is that since Wasm needs to interact with JavaScript to work it cannot work entirely by itself nor can it directly connect to the internet on its own so this dependency will always remainLets imagine a credit card stealer If an attacker wanted to try to stay under the radar for as long as possible they could employ WebAssembly but this would limit how much they can hide Since WebAssembly by itself cannot properly exfiltrate the data or even collect it it would still rely on JavaScript to capture said data and send it on its way The Wasm part would simply be responsible for telling the JavaScript which forms to capture what exfil domain to use etcA more troublesome scenario is the browser interaction because it interacts with JavaScript which runs directly on the visitors browser If a zero-day for a major browser is discovered attackers could make use of Wasm to exploit that vulnerability and evade detectionThankfully hackers want the most amount of profit for the least amount of work so it may take some time for attackers to resort to such complex methodologies when a simple PHP script still does the work just fineInfections like these can be tricky to navigate on your own if you dont have website backups to recover from and this becomes even worse if your website is already utilizing web-assembly for its daily operationsWebmasters looking to protect themselves from malware that employs WebAssembly should make efforts to prevent infections from occurring in the first placeOur website uses cookies which

us and our mission to help organizations defend against cyber crimeUA CERT has also published on several of these operations Links to UA CERT reports can be found throughout this blogSince the start of the Russian invasion public and private Ukrainian entities have been targeted by multiple cyber espionage groups This blog goes into detail regardingtwo operations from UNC2589 and an operation from clusters likely related to UNC1151 While these groups have distinct sponsors and goals the operations detailed here are united by their use of lure documents about public safety to entice victims to open the spear phishing attachment Spear phishes with themes that are urgent or timely can make a recipient more likely to open them and documents related to public safety and humanitarian emergencies are of particularly high interest to the residents of Ukraine following the Russian invasion These operations were designed to gain access to networks of interest but we do not have insight into the planned follow-on activities The malware used in these intrusion attempts would enable a wide variety of operations and these groups have previously conducted espionage information operations and disruptive attacks The intrusion attempts detailed below share a tactic however they are the work of two separate cyber espionage groups The activity discussed below is only a small subset of the extensive cyber operations that have targeted Ukraine with disruptive and espionage motivated operations UNC2589 is a cluster of cyber espionage activity Mandiant has tracked since early 2021 and may have been active as early as late 2020 Though UNC2589 has primarily targeted entities in Ukraine and Eastern Europe it has also actively targeted government and defense entities throughout Europe and North America We believe UNC2589 acts in support of Russian government goals but have not uncovered evidence to link it conclusivelyUNC2589 uses spear phishing campaigns which may be disguised as forwarded emails from both actor-controlled and compromised legitimate accounts Lure themes leveraged by UNC2589 include COVID-19 the war in Ukraine government related themes regional themes or even generic themes such as Bitcoin Payloads for the phishing operations include malicious macro documents CPL downloaders ZIP files or other archives UNC2589 has also used a variety of different infrastructure including actor-controlled domains IP addresses located mostly in Russia and Discord channelsThough we track UNC2589 as a cluster of cyber espionage activity we have attributed the January 14 destructive attack on Ukraine using PAYWIPE WHISPERGATE to UNC2589 We believe UNC2589 may be capable of engaging in disruptive or destructive cyber operations in the

uploads to the CC and can execute commands provided by the CC on the victims deviceMandiant analyzed a malicious document with an evacuation plan-themed lure likely used by UNC2589 to target Ukrainian entities in a phishing campaign in late February 2022 This sample is a packed SFX RAR that runs and installs an Arabic version of the RemoteUtils utility Upon execution the Remote Utilities utility reaches out to a CC used in an earlier UNC2589 operation also targeting UkraineThe infection vector is currently uncertain but we suspect the malicious files may have been delivered via phishing email It is important to note that Remote Utilities comes in a UPX-packed SFX RAR from the vendor and it does not appear the attackers changed the default However the attackers appear to have used several layers of password-protected archives before dropping and executing the default UPX-packed SFX extractor with a SFX RAR The lure documents all reference an evacuation plan allegedly originating from the Ukrainian SBUUpon execution of the packed SFX RAR it installs the Remote Utilities executable The Remote Utilities executable reaches out to preconfigured CCs iteratively over TCPRemote Utilities is not malicious by itself but can be used maliciously by threat actors The utility can enable a threat actor toRemote Utilities allows attackers to set persistence through creating a startup serviceThe malware was delivered via phishing email The attacker used a compromised legitimate account from a related organization to send the phishing emails on March 27 The phishing email contained an attached XLS document with macrosThe macros in the document were designed by ExcelVBAru a company that designs macros for business use However in this case the macro was used to drop a malicious payload onto the victim machine The companys website makes the macros freely available so we have no indication that they are tied to this activity or even aware of it Upon execution of Base-Updateexe it proceeds to download Base64-decode and execute another time stomped downloader written in Go from http1943198124443i with the arguments a 0CyCcrhI6B5wKE8XLOdwJava-sdkexe sets persistence for itself via setting a Run registry key It then proceeds to download decode and execute two additional Base64-encoded files GRIMPLANT and GRAPHSTEELUpon execution of GRIMPLANT it reads its configured CC from the command line The configured CC is Base64-encoded and AESCTS-encrypted and results in GRIMPLANT communicating to 1943198124 GRIMPLANT conducts a basic system survey querying the followingGRIMPLANT then uploads the system survey to the CC Note that GRIMPLANT communicates with the CC over Google RPC using TLS GRIMPLANT handles PowerShell commands it receives from the CC sending the result of the command back to the CC Unlike GRAPHSTEEL GRIMPLANT does not use an added layer of encryption to its CC communicationsUpon execution of GRAPHSTEEL it conducts a system survey of the host and user information and reaches out to the ipify API to determine the IP address It then AESCTS encrypts and uploads the surveyed victim information to the CC When it gets a response from the CC GRAPHSTEEL proceeds to harvest browser credentials includingGRAPHSTEEL also attempts to collect mail data from Mozilla Thunderbird extract data from Filezilla find unprotected SSH keys on the target machine query Putty to access the public key and read any MobaXterm config After collecting this information it encrypts and uploads the information to the CC GRAPHSTEEL then enumerates drives D-Z and the files within each drive GRAPHSTEEL reads the content of each unique file and uploads those to the CCNote the GRAPHSTEEL project also does not have symbols stripped and the main Go package is called

        "text": "Typically this APT group focuses on targeting government government employees military personnel and pseudo-government entities think tanks conferences etc using remote access trojans RATs such as CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT However in this new campaign dating back to December 2021 the adversary is targeting students of universities and colleges in India This new campaign also suggests that the APT is actively expanding its network of victims to include civilian usersWe also assess with high confidence that a Pakistani web hosting services provider ZainHosting was employed by the APT for deploying and operating parts of Transparent Tribe's infrastructure used in this campaignThe group primarily uses three Windows-based malware families to carry out espionage activities against their targetsMalicious macro dropping embedded zip to disk The CrimsonRAT payloads deployed in this campaign are very similar to those from past Transparent Tribe campaigns It is the staple implant of choice for Transparent Tribe to establish long-term access into victim networks This RAT is actively updated adding new capabilities and obfuscating the implantThe latest version of CrimsonRAT seen in this campaign contains a number of capabilities includingA number of these maldocs and archives containing these maldocs were hosted on the domains registered by the attackers with the earliest domain registered in June 2021 These domains were named so that they would appear relevant to students and educational entities in India Some examples of domains registered by the threat actor areDuring the course of our research we discovered SSL certificate overlaps with another domain registered by the attackers in June 2021 geo-newstv using the email address immikhan034gmailcom This domain is a typo-squatted version of geotv a legitimate Pakistani news website Subdomains on the malicious typo-squatted domains include those that hosted SSL certificates for the student and media-themed malicious domainsAll the malicious domains have recently resolved to the same IP address 19837123126 This strongly suggests shared infrastructure among all the malicious domainsSSL certificate for geo-newstv Many of the domains registered by the attackers for this campaign consisted of rudimentary websites with front pages containing embedded Google Drive folders All of these folders contained pictures of women It is highly likely that these front pages will be used as stagers for honeytrap-based attacks in the future another tactic typical of the Transparent Tribe APTGoogle Drive folder embedded in the fake website operated by Transparent Tribe The DNS SOA records for all the malicious domains utilized in this APT campaign contain a common administrator email address rupees001atgmailcom This email address has been used to register and administer approximately 2000 legitimate and malicious domains However there are a couple of domains in this list that stand outOf the two domains vebhostcom hosts a dummy website that advertises website-building services The malicious domains used in this campaign such as studentsportallive and others use vebhostcom name servers specificallyTherefore it is highly likely that the operators registering and maintaining the malicious domains also operate web-hosting services through vebhostcomThe second domain zainhostingnet belongs to a seemingly legitimate web services and hosting provider called Zain Hosting based out of Lahore PakistanApart from zainhostingnet the hosting provider also operates zainhostingcom which is this business' primary front for their legitimate operations Interestingly vebhostcom uses zainhostingcom's name serversZainHosting advertises their services heavily on Facebook and has been active since at least 2010 Their webpage from 2010 listed rupees001atgmailcom as a contact address for the business This email has since been used to register renew and administer several malicious web pages over time including the malicious domains used by the Transparent Tribe APT in their most recent campaignZainHosting webpage from 2010 listing rupees001atgmailcom as a contact address All three sets of domains -- the malicious Transparent Tribe infrastructure vebhostcom and zainhostingnetcom -- are clearly related with ZainHosting' owning and operating the malicious infrastructure However the entire scope of ZainHosting's role in the Transparent Tribe organization is still unknown We believe with high confidence that ZainHosting is just one of the many infrastructure contractors hired by Transparent Tribe Such contractors might be hired to simply prepare and stage the APT's infrastructure and possibly be given packages archives etc containing malicious artifacts to deploy that are then distributed by the APT operators themselves to targets of interestTransparent Tribe has been aggressively trying to widen its net of victims in the Indian subcontinent Their operations started as early as at least 2016 and have largely focussed on infecting government and military officials in Afghanistan and India Over the past few years we saw the APT begin targeting pseudo-government entities and individuals belonging to think tanks and defense contractorsHowever their new campaign indicates that the threat actors' strategy is evolving to target civilian personnel specifically those connected to educational institutions This might be in accordance with their nation-state's goal to establish long-term access and steal valuable and restricted research from premier research institutions associated with the Indian government Keeping tabs on an adversary nation's research endeavors is a strategic goal adopted by many APT groups observed across the worldOrganizations must be diligent against such highly motivated adversaries that are rapidly evolving their strategies and expanding their network of targets In-depth defense strategies based on a risk analysis approach can deliver the best results in the prevention However this should always be complemented by a good incident response plan which has been not only tested with tabletop exercises and reviewed and improved every time it's put to the test on real engagementsWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed

        "text": "Frost Sullivan Names Cyberint Company of the Year in External Risk Mitigation Management CategoryIn June 2022 Cyberint observed a new hacktivist campaign targeting multiple Israeli organizations and enterprises coordinated via different social media platforms The campaign is led by hacktivists originating in a group called GhostSecGhostSec was first identified in 2015 and was initially founded to attack ISIS in the cyber realm as part of the fight against Islamic extremism In past years the group participated in several campaigns against several counties including Nigeria Colombia Lebanon and South Africa From the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war the group sided with Ukraine and published mainly Russian-related leaks DDOS and content under the campaign OpRussiaAt the end of June 2022 the group declared it was joining the OpIsrael campaign Immediately after their announcement the group pivoted from their regular operations and started to target multiple Israeli companies presumably gaining access to various IoT interfaces and ICSSCADA systems which led to possible disruptionsThe group is well aware of the public relations and news activities related to their operations responding on social media platforms about what they are up to Group members are mainly active on Telegram and Twitter the platforms primarily used to share their target lists and attack resultsGhostSec a vigilante group managed and operated by hacktivists was originally founded prior to 2014 and was initially called We Are The ResistanceActing as We Are The Resistance the group didnt participate in glorious attacks and campaigns instead mainly trained enthusiastic beginner-level cyber candidates aka script kiddies including publishing various cyber-quizzesIn 2015 the groups activity increased and they rebranded themselves as GhostSec joining the fight against ISIS and Islamic extremism Throughout 2015 the group was associated with taking down hundreds of ISIS websites and social media accounts while gaining the cooperation of law enforcement By the end of 2015 GhostSec decided to transform its fight against ISIS officials stopped cooperating with the Anonymous hacktivist group and renamed itself Ghost security Group1The members who opposed this process continued operating under the name GhostSec and currently seem to target Israeli and American companiesThe GhostSec hacktivist group is active on multiple social media platformsThe group maintains a Telegram account with currently more than 8K followers The account is mainly used for publications and announcements rather than as a sharing tools or instructions Their Telegram group has been active since November 2020 and was involved in several campaigns including OpNigeria OpColombia and OpRussiaAdditionally Cyberint was able to trace several social media accounts of GhostSec memberspossibly Nicola IvikovGoing back to 2018 Cyberint detected that the group was targeting the Israeli Airforce website GhostSec took responsibility for the websites takedown on their Twitter accountAn additional attack on an Israeli target was published in 2021 when the group attacked HRVAC an Israeli engineering company involved in the Ben Gurion Airport Energy Center project According to GhostSec the website was taken down and the data was dumped Later in 2021 the group shared a thin 10MB file presumably containing internal data from the HRVAC websiteThe subsequent activity against Israeli targets began on June 28 2022 followed by an announcement that the group had officially joined the OpIsrael campaign due to continuous Israeli attacks against PalestiniansLess than an hour later an IoT attack began The group uploaded a video to their Telegram channel that showed that an air conditioning interface belonging to bezeqintnet a major ISP in Israel was hackedOn June 29 the group shared additional video evidence of the exposed interface of ELNet an energy meter and electrical power meter at MATAM acronym for the Scientific Industries Center being accessed by the group According to the group they gained access to five similar IoT devices in different locations and modified the settings to switch the lights off in all five of themAnother IoT device was added to the victims list The group accessed the Partnercoil interface of an IoT-based smart sprinkling system However there was no evidence of a disruption of the systems workflowOn July 6 the group shared screenshots of EEM devices measuring electrical parameters in low-voltage In addition the group also shared Or Akivas pump station IoT interface whose activities the group claims to have disruptedAfter deploying IoT attacks on multiple Israeli Organizations the group shifted into the SCADAICS domain attacking Israeli PLCs Programmable Logic Controller using the Metasploit framework module auxiliaryadminscadamulticipcommand This vulnerability was first disclosed in 2012 and continues to be modified 2020 The exploit implements the CPU STOP command as well as the ability to crash the Ethernet card in an affected deviceTo date around 5000 PLCs worldwide are exposed via port 44818 and might be affected by this kind of attackThe group members maintain several GitHub accounts These accounts contain tools that group members use The main repository used by the group ghostsec420 includes seven repositories some of which include campaign output such as the NigeriaLeaks vulnerability scanners and exploits The most interesting is the Sophisticated Cyber Penetration Attacks SCPA repository which contains advanced attack tools and guides from various sources one of which is last Septembers plug and play Conti affiliate playbooks leak and might still be in use to target future victimsOne of the directories also obtained from Contis repository leak is the CVE directory which contains exploits and user instructions from Contis playbook Among the exploits are ZeroLogon and DirtyPipe The full list contains different and updated versions to those leaked from ContiMetabaseCVE-2021-41277In addition to the GitHub account the group also has a Pastebin user called xGhostSecx which has been active for a couple of years The account includes anti-Israeli logs from an online reconnaissance tool which resulted in a list of domains and IPs of governmental entities in 2021Recently Cyberint detected a paste on a paste site named pstklgrthio published by the group on July 8 with the topic Op Israehell The paste includes partial reconnaissance output of what GhostSec claims to be state-owned companies such as Rafael Bank Hapoalim Israel Post IEC etcThe paste includes a target list of several companies subdomains and their corresponding IP addresses which can later be used to execute malicious activity against these companies Additionally it is possible that the information gathered may be exploited by other threat actors seeking to attack Israeli companiesGhostsec is still highly active In July 2023 Brazilian Senior Sistemas was leaked by GhostSec and Stormous Cyberint detected a leak from the Brazilian software company Senior Sistemas which was disclosed by the threat actor group GhostSec The attack was carried out in collaboration with the Stormous threat actor group The leak was made public after Senior Sistemas denied being hacked prompting GhostSec to release this 8GB data dump Notably Senior Sistemas holds a significant presence in both the private and public sectors in BrazilThe GhostSec group is not the usual DDOSdefacement hacktivist group we are familiar with from the Opisrael operations The groups core members have participated in multiple campaigns for a long time The group maintains its arsenal and set of techniques to assess damage in

assisted by the Forum voor Democratie pro-Russian political party is scheduled for July 10 in Amsterdam at Europe Square 24 1078GZ Moscow has set agoal for the organizers of the event to blame the West and the United States for the war and prevent the Netherlands from providing military assistance for UkraineThe organizers are also expected to make an attempt toquestion the facts of Russian war crimes in Ukraineand justify Putins policiesThe Kremlin has set up to restage the operation of 2016 that way when Russian puppet partys leader Thierry Baudet campaigned against granting Ukraine the status of an associated EU memberRussia is eager not just to use the FvD to hit Ukraine but also to oust the Dutch government by stirring up a government crisisFor thatRussian informationcampaign Thierry Baudetgot fundingfrom the Russian embassy in the Netherlands Russian Ambassador O Shulginwill be one of the key speakers at the ForumAnonymous counterintelligence sources saythat Moscow helped Thierry Baudet to form the party and promote it in the mediaHenk Otten a former party colleague of Thierry Baudet told the NL Times this February that Baudet was a puppet of an enemy power RussiaThe FvD party announced itself in 2016 with its ideology promoted amid the migration crisis from Syria initiated by Russia and effort to squash the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU Despite tough criticism of migration Baudets mother has origins in Indonesia There is a possibility of Moscow having got dirt on BaudetThoseefforts were largely funded by Russian intelligence which facilitated setting up the partys administrative structure its assets and media promotionDirect democracy through referendums is among the FvDs priorities also consistently promoted by Russia in some countries by means of friendly parties including UkraineMoscow believes disinformation campaigns and controlled propaganda media can shape temporary public opinion that might affect the outcome of those referendumsThat is why Russia provides substantial funding for the far-right parties and Eurosceptics and infiltrates there to create preconditions for the EUs disintegration The FvD for instance is in favor of the Netherlands leaving the EU by a referendum like BrexitAs Russia started the war against Ukraine Baudet became heavily involved in the Kremlins information campaigns He twitted a video accusing the West of making Russia launch the military operation to demilitarize Ukraine Prior to the war Baudet was excited about the actions by Russias President Vladimir Putin as the allies warned of highly possible Russian invasion of UkraineOtten said that in 2015Baudet hinted in personal letter that Russia was giving him money for pro-Russian propaganda in the Netherlands5 years later in 2020 Baudets WhatsApp messages revealing his contact with Vladimir Kornilov associated with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service came out in the mediaThose messages proved Kornilov had significant impact on what Baudet did concerning Ukraine and anti-NATO campaignsBaudet also mentioned financial support by Kornilov in message exchanges with his FvD colleagues Baudet was also among those who initiated an appeal to ex-US President Donald Trump demanding a new investigation of MH-17 Malaysia Airlines downing as part of Russian intelligence operationThierry and Kornilov were engaged in active cooperation to discredit the JIT investigation in the Netherlands in 2019 when they attracted the RLIs attentionAn investigation by ZemblaTV programand De Nieuws BV confirmed the RLIs findings andprovedthat Baudetmet Kornilov in late 2015 for an interview on a Russian website and they havebeenin touch ever sinceBaudet invited Kornilov to address the FvD meeting and translated Kornilovs articles into Dutch Baudet most likely facilitated posting of those articles on the GeenStijl blog which was the information core for the propaganda by EuroscepticsThat wayBaudet is likely to have come to the attention of Russian SVR station in Amsterdam as a promising candidate to recruitLots of signals he was getting Russian money and taking part in campaigns carried out by Russians just confirm thatRussian intelligence recruited him in exchange for money and dirtFully opaque Baudets income that he gets aside from the work in parliament does not work to his advantage That indirectly proves he is financed by Russian intelligence A VVD Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy MP Ruben Brekelmans said Baudets statements were reprehensible and appalling while D66 Democrats

        "title": "AsyncRAT Being Distributed to Unsecured MySQL Servers - ASEC BLOG",
        "text": "The ShadowServer foundation has recently released a report showing that there are about 36 million MySQL servers exposed to outside Along with MS-SQL server MySQL server is one of the main database servers that provides the feature of managing large amounts of data in a corporate or user environment MS-SQL is mainly used in Windows environments but MySQL is still being used by many in Linux environmentsASEC analysis team is constantly monitoring malware distributed to unsecured database servers In Windows environment the majority of the attacks were done against MS-SQL server and this can be confirmed in AhnLabs ASD log Various attack cases were introduced in the previous ASEC blogs such as Cobalt Strike Remcos RAT and CoinMinercjdmacjdmwkAccording to AhnLabs ASD log the majority of the malware distributed to unsecured MySQL servers are variant malware of Gh0st RAT including Gh0stCringe above In this blog an analysis of attack methods used against unsecured MySQL servers and AsyncRAT found in these recent attacks will be discussedFirst attackers conduct scanning to search for a target to attack Among externally exposed systems the scanner searches for system that has 3306TCP port revealed used by MySQL server After then upon using brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks against the system attackers can obtain root user account credentials if the system was being managed in improper waysNormally multiple methods to execute OS commands are provided in MS-SQL environment The most well-known command is xpcmdshell and there are other various methods such as OLE Store Procedure MS-SQL Agent Jobs Extended Stored Procedure and CLR Stored Procedure Being able to execute a users command using OS commands eg cmd or powershell means that the control over the system can be obtainedIn other words logging in to the data server can execute the Windows command eventually gaining control of the system Thus for security policy reasons admin accounts should be able to use the features above Also additional security settings need to be changedMySQL does not support direct OS commands such as xpcmdshell like MS-SQL but it can eventually be executed by an attacker using a feature called User Defined Function UDF UDF is an implementation of the features desired by the user in DLL and the attackers upload a UDF library or DLL containing malicious commands to the infected system and then load it into the MySQL server After then malicious commands can be delivered to an infected system by executing the command explained aboveThe following are features exported by Metasploits UDF library DLL file including features such as command execution sysexec and environment variable return sysgetTaking a look into the infection log of the actual attack target system malicious UDF DLL is also installed along with AsyncRAT see Figure below This malware only has the feature of simply executing the command received from the attackerAs this malware has continuously been used in the past it has infected various systems The following are the path names found in the infection log and the history created in the plugin folder where UDF is installed by default can be foundSince the system is in a unsecured environment there are already cases in which it was infected with malware by numerous attacks Thus we do not know whether it was installed by attacker that uses AsyncRAT or its relationsAsyncRAT used in the attack is an open-source RAT malware developed with NET and it can perform various malicious actions such as remote shell keylogging and account credentials theft by receiving the attackers commands from the CC serverAs AsyncRAT is open-source it is being distributed in various ways Recently it disguised itself as a crack program of commercial software and was distributed via malicious websites In the past it was distributed via spam email In addition there were cases of distribution of illegal pornography through Discord which was introduced in the previous ASEC blog Typical attacks that target database servers MS-SQL MySQL servers include brute force attacks and dictionary attacks on systems where account credentials are poorly being managed Although it seems like these methods make up the majority of the attacks there can be vulnerability attacks against systems where their vulnerability has not been patchedBecause of this administrators should use passwords that are difficult to guess for their accounts and change them periodically to protect the database server from brute force attacks and dictionary attacks and update to the latest patch to prevent vulnerability attacks Administrators should also use security programs such as firewalls for database servers accessible from outside to restrict access of external attackersAhnLabs anti-malware software V3 detects and blocks the malware using the following aliasesFile Detection TrojanWin32RLGenericC4239825 2020112601

        "text": "InhaltThis report builds on the findings published by Talos and covers an attack presumabily conducted in mid May 2022Figure 1 Visible contents of the Excel documentWithout alerting the user in any way the Equation Editor is started in the background and used to download the next malware stage and execute it By tracing the Process Tree with ProcMon we can see that the downloaded binary is written to CDrwfsutilexe and executed by the Windows ExplorerFigure 2 Process Tree of Equation EditorFigure 3 Registering a debugger for Equation EditorSince Excel is waiting on the Equation Editor to exit our debugging session will unfortunately be ended after a fixed amount of time with the error message below so we will have to approach it differentlyFigure 4 Error dialog while debugging Equation EditorFigure 5 Viewing the contents of the Excel file with oledumpBy specifying the stream and the -d parameter we can dump it to analyze it furtherFigure 6 Dumping the Equation streamOpening the dumped file in a hex editor we can visually identify two different segments of data Highlighted in green we see data that is likely the shellcode required for the Equation Editor exploit Since there are next to no readable ASCII strings in there looking closely we can spot fragments that look like URL or http this data is likely encoded or encrypted in some way Below that we can see data in a repeating pattern which is used as padding for the memory corruption exploit CVE-2018-0798Figure 7 Analyzing the shellcode in a Hex editorFigure 8 Running frequency analysis on the shellcodeUsing Cyberchef with the presumed shellcode section and XOR key does yield readable strings From here we can extract important information about the executed shellcode and indicators like the URL for the next malware stageFigure 9 Decoding the XOR-ed shellcodeThe visualization below shows the most important API calls made in the shellcodeFigure 10 Graph showing the functionality of the maldoc shellcodeBy debugging the Equation Editor exploit again and manually placing a breakpoint on eg URLDownloadToFileA we can confirm these findingsFigure 11 Manually loading urlmondll to place a breakpoint on URLDownloadToFileAThe download query to emshedulersvccomvcvc returns a sample of Bitters second stage Downloader which we will investigate nextFigure 12 Breaking on URLDownloadToFileFigure 13 Detect it Easy parsing the PE file Entropy graphComparing this fingerprinting function to the one documented by Cisco Talos we can see that Bitter abandoned the ZxxZ value separator that gave the Downloader its name in exchange for a simple underscore This was possibly done to avoid detection through IDSIPS systems based on this very specific separator Looking back at older Bitter Research we can see that the threat group likes to change up these patterns from time to time to avoid detectionFigure 14 ZxxZ gathering system informationThe check-in with an attacker-controlled staging server contains the user account and hostname of the system The function below manually assembles the HTTP GET request and sends it via a socket connection to the C2 serverFigure 15 ZxxZ sending a GET request with the host fingerprint to the C2We verified this network communication using packet captures Another common indicator across Bitter infrastructure is the use of the LiteSpeed web server which has been documented in older reports as wellFigure 16 Packet capture of the GET request aboveAfter retrieving the next malware stage from a staging server ZxxZ writes the binary to the disk and tries to execute it In the screenshot below we can see that the Bitter group altered the C2 opcode strings that Talos had previously documented as DN-S download success and RNE run error to just S and F presumably short for Success and Failure This is likely another measure to evade older detection rules The payload execution was also changed to use CreateProcessA instead of ShellExecuteA like in the older version of ZxxZFigure 17 ZxxZ retrieving and executing the next stageUnfortunately the actual payload could not be retrieved from the staging server as it only returned an empty file named CAPTmsiFigure 18 Request made to another staging server for the third stageFigure 19 Detect it Easy parsing the Almond RAT PE fileFigure 20 Main function setting a MutexAlmond RAT employs string encryption to hinder detection and reverse engineering Important revealing strings like the CommandControl C2 IP address below are therefore wrapped in the ciphertextDecrypt functionFigure 21 StartClient fuction showing the AES string encryptionThe decryption function implements a default AES-256-CBC encryption scheme where the IV and key are derived from the given plaintext password via PDKDF2 Since it is trivial to reimplement this in eg Python we decrypted all of the encrypted strings in the binary and modified the NET assembly to increase code readability for this report The file hashes of the unaltered and modified binaries can be found in the IoC section at the end of the postFigure 22 String decryption function using AES CBCThe StartClient function implements the socket-based C2 communication interface for Almond RAT In the samples we observed there were no domains or dynamic DNS services but only IPv4 addresses used to connect back to the threat actors A characteristic property of the RAT is the usage of the tcp port 33638 When first contacting the C2 server Almond RAT transmits gathered system information like hostname OS version internal IP address and MAC address and storage identifiers disk info is not transmitted to fingerprint the infected system A 1024 byte buffer is used for the C2 communicationFigure 23 StartClient functionNext well will further investigate the functionality of Almond RAT At the beginning of the StartCommWithServer function the RAT sets a random receive timeout between 20 and 30 seconds for the socket The analyzed sample accepts seven different commands in total The REFRESH command is used as a heartbeat signal letting the C2 server know that the RAT is still active and will reply with a simple OKThe DRIVE command returns a list of connected storage devicesWith the DELETE command the attackers can delete accessible files by supplying a path In case of eg insufficient permissions it will return the exception The in the command string is used as a separator between the command and the file pathFigure 24 Basic C2 functionalityAlmond RAT allows for the execution of arbitrary commands via a wrapped cmdexe instance It has its own implementation for directory changes via cd and directory listings via OK The CMD command uses a tilde instead of an asterisk to separate the parts of the commandFigure 25 Command executionIn addition to the functionality of listing directories and files via the command prompt the RAT also supports a quite involved DIR command It is capable of verifying file accessibility and displaying meta data like the last file write-timeFigure 26 Directory and File listingsSince Bitters main objective is espionage they need a way to exfiltrate data to the C2 server from the system which is done via the DOWNLOAD commandTo drop more malware or other files onto the system it also supports the UPLOAD command which uses the following file naming scheme yyyyMMdd-hhmmssfilenameFigure 27 DOWNLOAD and UPLOAD functionsIn case the RAT receives an unknown command from the operator it will return the message XXX to indicate the errorFigure 28 Exception handling in case of an unknown commandAlmond RATs main purposes seem to be file system discovery data exfiltration and a way to load more toolsestablish persistence The design of the tools seems to be layed out in way that it can be quickly modified and adapted to the current attack scenarioThe staging server for the Downloader and the staging server for the RAT are hosted with Host Sailor The CommandControl server for the Downloader is hosted with Namecheap and the one for Almond RAT is hosted with Nexeon Technologies Except for the samples analysed in this report there was no other significant malware activity detected with these four domainsStaging server ZxxZ downloaderC2 server ZxxZ downloaderStaging server third stageAlmond RAT C2 serverWhile investigating these DNS entries we also noticed that on the 30052022 a new record for spurshipbrokercom on 19436191196 was created This domain seems to be a so-called typosquat impersonation of spurshipbrokerscom an Indian Marine Shipping and Transport company This record stood out between seemingly legitimate webhosting and typosquats for banking sites on this WebhostIP used by Bitter While we do not have further evidence at this point in time that this is related to the Bitter activity it certainly does fit the approach of the group and the Naval-themed lureYara Rule SetAuthor SECUINFRA Falcon

        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather DEV-0237 is now tracked as Pistachio TempestMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center MSTIC discovered the new variant while analyzing detected Hive ransomware techniques for dropping key files We know that Hive drops its encryption keys file which contains encrypted keys used to decrypt encrypted files and uses a consistent naming patternThe said key files were missing the VICTIMIDENTIFIER part of the file name prompting deeper analysis of the Hive ransomware that dropped them This analysis led to the discovery of the new Hive variant and its multiple versions which exhibit slightly different available parameters in the command line and the executed processesAnalyzing these patterns in samples of the new variants we discovered even more samples all with a low detection rate and none being correctly identified as Hive In this blog we will share our in-depth analysis of the new Hive variant including its main features and upgrades with the aim of equipping analysts and defenders with information to better identify and protect organizations against malware attacks relying on HiveThe main difference between the new Hive variant and old ones is the programming language used The old variants were written in Go also referred to as GoLang while the new Hive variant is written in RustHive isnt the first ransomware written in RustBlackCat another prevalent ransomware was the first By switching the underlying code to Rust Hive benefits from the following advantages that Rust has over other programming languagesThe new Hive variant uses string encryption that can make it more evasive Strings reside in the rdata section and are decrypted during runtime by XORing with constants The constants that are used to decrypt the same string sometimes differ across samples making them an unreliable basis for detectionFor example lets look at the section where part of the string error no flag -u loginpassword provided is decrypted In one sample SHA-256 f4a39820dbff47fa1b68f83f575bc98ed33858b02341c5c0464a49be4e6c76d3 the constants are 0x9F2E3F1F and 0x95C9In another sample SHA-256 6e5d49f604730ef4c05cfe3f64a7790242e71b4ecf1dc5109d32e811acf0b053 the constants are 0x3ECF7CC4 and 0x198FSome samples do share constants when decrypting the same string For example lets look where the parameter string -da is decrypted In one sample SHA-256 88b1d8a85bf9101bc336b01b9af4345ed91d3ec761554d167fe59f73af73f037 the constants are 0x71B4 and 2In another sample SHA-256 33744c420884adf582c46a4b74cbd9c145f2e15a036bb1e557e89d6fd428e724 the constants are the sameIn old Hive variants the username and the password used to access the Hive ransom payment website are embedded in the samples In the new variant these credentials must be supplied in the command line under the -u parameter which means that they cant be obtained by analysts from the sample itselfLike most modern ransomware Hive introduces command-line parameters which allow attackers flexibility when running the payload by adding or removing functionality For example an attacker can choose to encrypt files on remote shares or local files only or select the minimum file size for encryption In the new Hive variant we found the following parameters across different samplesOverall it appears different versions have different parameters that are constantly updated Unlike in previous variants where there was a help menu in the new variant the attacker must know the parameters beforehand Since all strings are encrypted it makes finding the parameters challenging for security researchersLike most sophisticated malware Hive stops services and processes associated with security solutions and other tools that might get in the way of its attack chain Hive tries to impersonate the process tokens of trustedinstallerexe and winlogonexe so it can stop Microsoft Defender Antivirus among other servicesHive stops the following servicesIt also stops the following processesAs part of its ransomware activity Hive typically runs processes that delete backups and prevent recovery There are differences between versions and some samples may not execute all these processes but one sample that starts the most processes is SHA-256 481dc99903aa270d286f559b17194b1a25deca8a64a5ec4f13a066637900221eHives ransom note has also changed with the new version referencing the key files with their new file name convention and adding a sentence about virtual machines VMsThe older variants had an embedded username and password marked as hidden In the new variant the username and password are taken from the command line parameter -u and are labeled testhiveusername and testhivepasswordOld ransom note textNew ransom note textA unique encryption approachThe new Hive variant uses a unique approach to file encryption Instead of embedding an encrypted key in each file that it encrypts it generates two sets of keys in memory uses them to encrypt files and then encrypts and writes the sets to the root of the drive it encrypts both with key extensionTo indicate which keys set was used to encrypt a file the name of the key file containing the corresponding encryption keys is added to the name of the encrypted file on disk followed by an underscore and then a Base64 string also adding underscore and hyphen to the character set Once its Base64-decoded the string contains two offsets with each offset pointing to a different location in the corresponding key file This way the attacker can decrypt the file using these offsetsFor example after running Hive we got the following files dropped to the C driveIn this example a file named myphotojpg would be renamed to Cmyphotojpgl0Zn68cb -B82BhIaGhI8 As we discuss in the following sections the new variants keys set generation is entirely different from old variants However its actual file encryption is very similarKeys set generationA buffer of size 0xCFFF00 bytes is allocated Using two custom functions to generate random bytes labeled randomnumgen and randomnumgen2 for demonstration purposes the buffer is filled The first 0xA00000 bytes of this buffer are filled with random bytes and the remaining 0x2FFF00 bytes are simply copied from the first 0x2FFF00 random bytes that were copied earlier to the bufferThe content of each buffer is a keys set a collection of symmetric keys Since two buffers are allocated there are two keys sets In the encryption process the malware randomly selects different keys byte sequences for each file from one of the keys set and uses them to encrypt the file by XORing the byte sequence of the keys with the files contentA custom 64-byte hash is prepared for each keys set This hash will be used laterAfter the hash is computed and several other strings are decrypted the encryption process takes the following stepsNow that the keys set is finally encrypted the nonce victimpublickey the now-encrypted keys set and the authentication tag are copied to a new buffer one after another This buffer which we label encryptedstructure1 is treated as a new keys set which is again encrypted using the same method described above but with a second hivepublickey This time the function outputs new nonce victimprivatekey and others Only the associated data is the sameFinally the new buffer which contains the secondnonce secondvictimpublickey and the encryptedencryptedstructure1 is written to the root of the drive its encrypting for example C The createextension function generates a Base64 string based on the first six bytes of the custom hash that was created earlier This Base64 string serves as the file name and the extension of the file is simply keyThe diagram below illustrates the encryption scheme described aboveAs seen in the diagram above Keys sets encryption flow is executed twice In the first round it is executed with the original keys set as an input In the second round it is executed with the encrypted structure 1 as an input In its second execution all other input values are different except the AD associated data and the Basepoint 9Hence the following values are new in the second execution victimprivatekey victimpublickey hivepublickey nonce sharedsecret and derivedkeyFile encryptionAfter both keys files are written to the disk the multi-threaded file encryption starts Before encrypting each file the malware checks its name and extension against a list of strings If there is a match then the file will not be encrypted For example a file with exe extension will not be encrypted if exe is in the list of strings It should be noted that this list is encrypted and decrypted during runtimeThe same file encryption method seen in old variants is used in the new one two random numbers are generated and used as offsets to the keys set Each offset is four bytesFor the encryption the files content is XORed with bytes from the keys set according to the offsets The file bytes are XORed twiceonce according to the first offset and a second time according to the second offset Files are encrypted in blocks of 0x100000 bytes with the maximum number of blocks at 100 There is an interval between the encrypted blocks as defined by blockspace After the encryption is finished in memory the encrypted data is written to the disk overwriting the original fileLooking at when createextension is called once file encryption has started we recognized a similar structure in the previous variantLet us look at the value 72 D7 A7 A3 F5 5B FF EF 21 6B 11 7C 2A 18 CD 00 in the address of r9 register just before createextension is called on a file called EDBtmplogAnd if we step over createextension the result is similarwe get ctenoVb as the key file name note Since Hive uses a different Base64 character set was replaced with Microsoft will continue to monitor the Hive operators activity and implement protections for our customers The current detections advanced detections and indicators of compromise IOCs in place across our security products are

malicious payload command and control C2 and packagingIn terms of C2 we found that the sample called home to an Amazon Web Services AWS IP address located in the United States over port 443 Further the X509 certificate on the listening port was configured to impersonate Microsoft with an organization name of Microsoft and organization unit of Security Additionally pivoting on the certificate and other artifacts we identified a total of 41 malicious IP addresses nine BRc4 samples and an additional three organizations across North and South America who have been impacted by this tool so farOverall we believe this research is significant in that it identifies not only a new red team capability that is largely undetectable by most cybersecurity vendors but more importantly a capability with a growing user base that we assess is now leveraging nation-state deployment techniques This blog provides an overview of BRc4 a detailed analysis of the malicious sample a comparison between the packaging of this sample and a recent APT29 sample and a list of indicators of compromise IoCs that can be used to hunt for this activityWe encourage all security vendors to create protections to detect activity from this tool and all organizations to be on alert for activity from this toolPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections from the threats described in this blog through Threat Prevention Cortex XDR and WildFire malware analysisHowever of greater concern the release description also specifically noted that this release was built after reverse engineering several top tier EDR and Antivirus DLLsOur analysis highlights the ongoing and relevant debate within the cybersecurity industry surrounding the ethics relating to the development and use of penetration testing tools that can be exploited for offensive purposesBRc4 currently advertises itself as A Customized Command and Control Center for Red Team and Adversary Simulation On May 16 Nayak announced that the tool had gained 480 users across 350 customersThe latest version Brute Ratel v10 Sicilian Defense was released a day later on May 17 and is currently offered for sale at a price of 2500 per user and 2250 per renewal With this price point and customer base BRc4 is positioned to take in more than 1 million dollars in sales over the next yearFigure 3 BRc4 licensing and costIn terms of features BRc4 advertises the following capabilitiesThe file in VirusTotal named RoshanCViso SHA256 1FC7B0E1054D54CE8F1DE0CC95976081C7A85C7926C03172A3DDAA672690042C appears to be a curriculum vitae similar to a resume of an individual named Roshan It was uploaded to VirusTotal on May 19 2022 from Sri Lanka The ISO file extension refers to an optical disc image file derived from the International Organization for Standardizations ISO 9960 file system which is typically used to back up files for CDDVD The ISO file is not malicious and requires a user to double-click which mounts the ISO as a Windows drive Finally the archived files of the ISO are displayed to the user In this case when the ISO is double-clicked a user is presented with the followingAs depicted in Figure 5 the user would see a file named Roshan-BandaraCVDialog which has a fake icon image of Microsoft Word purporting to be an individual's CV and written in Microsoft Word From the window dialog box it can be ascertained that the ISO was assembled on May 17 2022 which coincidentally is the same day the new BRc4 was releasedIf the user were to double-click on the file it would then install Brute Ratel C4 on the user's machineBy default on Windows operating systems hidden files are not displayed to the user In Figure 6 there are four hidden files concealed from view If the display of hidden files is enabled the user sees the followingThe lure file the one visible to the user is a Windows shortcut file LNK with the following propertiesMicrosoft shortcut files those with a lnk file extension contain enriched metadata that can be used to provide artifacts about the file Some key artifacts of this file areWhen Roshan-BandaraCVDialog is double-clicked the following actions occurFigure 8 below gives an overview of how this process would lookThe composition of the ISO file RoshanCVISO closely resembles that of other nation-state APT tradecraft The following table shows a side-by-side comparison of RoshanCVISOand that of a previously identified APT29 sample DecretISOThe following images show how RoshanCVISO and DecretISO would look to a user when double-clicked Figure 9 is a screenshot of the default Windows File Explorer show hidden files is not checked In both images the user is presented with a shortcut file LNK file that starts the malicious activity when double-clickedFigure 10 shows how the ISOs would appear when show hidden files is enabled for viewingThe flow of execution is the

via spear phishing email campaigns or downloaded to the victim by a second-stage downloaderWhile we lack insight into how this particular payload was delivered to a target environment we observed connection attempts to the C2 server originating from three Sri Lankan IP addresses between May 19-20Versiondll is a modified version of a legitimate Microsoft file written in C The implanted code is used to load and decrypt an encrypted payload file The decrypted payload is that of shellcode x64 assembly that is further used to execute Brute Ratel C4 on the hostIn order for Versiondll to maintain its code capabilities for OneDriveUpdaterexe the actors include the legitimate digitally signed Microsoft versiondll and named it vresiondll Any time OneDriveUpdaterexe makes a call into the actors Versiondll the call is proxied to vresiondll Because of this the actors versiondll will load vresiondll as a dependency fileThe implanted code begins when the DLL is loaded via DLLPROCESSATTACH and performs the following at the DLLMain subroutineThe technique outlined above uses process injection via undocumented Windows NTAPI calls The decrypted payload is now running within the runtimebrokerexe memory space The following is a snippet of code from versiondll that starts the execution of the in-memory decrypted payloadThe decrypted payload file is x64 shellcode assembly instructions that involves a series of executions to unpack itself The assembly instructions involve multiple push and mov instructions The purpose of this is to copy the Brute Ratel C4 code x64 assembly onto the stack eight bytes at a time and eventually reassemble it into a memory space for execution a DLL with a stripped MZ header Using a series of push and mov instructions evades in-memory scanning as the shellcode is assembled in blocks versus the entire code base being exposed for scanning The entry point of the decrypted payload is the followingThe unpacking involves 25772 push and 25769 mov instructions When finished the code performs the followingThe following is a snippet of the code that calls NtCreateThreadEx and starts the execution of the second-stage shellcodeThe configuration data is passed as a parameter to the start address of the new thread This data includes the encrypted configuration settings for Brute Ratel C4 The encrypted contents are the followingThe data is base64-encoded and RC4-encrypted The 16-byte RC4 decryption key is bYXJm3MXyMBFThe decrypted configuration file isEach parameter is delineated with a pipe character and one of the values is the IP seen earlier of 174129157251 and port of 443Once the SSL handshake to IP 174129157251 is complete the following data is sent via HTTP POST to the Brute Ratel C4 listener portTo identify the decrypted in-memory payload as being associated with Brute Ratel C4 we conducted hunting based on the unique in-memory assembly instructions push and mov These instructions are used to build the second layer of shellcode Searching across VirusTotal we found a second sample with the same push and mov instructionsSide-by-side comparison of the entry point of badgerx64exe and our decrypted OneDriveUpdate sampleWhen badgerx64exe is finished with the push and mov instructions it makes the same Windows API calls as OneDriveUpdate using API hashing but does not use direct syscall a user configuration feature of Brute Ratel C4 Example of badgerx64exeLike the OneDriveUpdate sample the parameter passed to the calling thread is the configuration data for Brute Ratel C4 In this sample the data is not base64-encoded or RC4-encrypted and is passed in the clear The following is the configuration used for this sampleIn this case the sample is configured to communicate with IP 1596518650 on TCP port 443Based on the following we can conclude that OneDriveUpdate is indeed associated with Brute Ratel C4The file badgerx64exe is a standalone x64 executable that runs Brute Ratel C4 badger payload while the decrypted OneDriveUpdate file is the in-memory component of Brute Ratel C4 that is executed using the actor's modified DLL versiondllAfter validating that badgerx64exe and OneDriveUpdate were both BRc4 payloads we set to work analyzing the employment of this second sampleVirusTotal records revealed that the sample was uploaded by a web user in Ukraine on May 20 2022 Coincidentally this happens to be one day after the RoshanCVISO file was uploadedAs noted above the sample was configured to call home to 1596518650 on port 443 Palo Alto Networks Cortex Xpanse history shows that this port was open from May 21-June 18 2022 with the same Microsoft Security self-signed SSL certificate seen above Given this timeline it's worth noting that the sample was actually uploaded to VirusTotal prior to the C2 infrastructure being configured to listen for the callbacksEvaluating netflow connections for 1596518650 during this time window revealed several connections to ports 22 443 and 8060 originating from a Ukrainian IP 21320056105 We assess this Ukrainian address is likely a residential user IP that was leveraged to administer the C2 infrastructure A deeper look at connections in and out of 21320056105 further revealed several flows over UDP port 33445 This port is commonly used by Tox a secure peer-to-peer chat and video application that offers end-to-end encryptionExamining additional connections to port 443 on 1596518650 we identified several suspected victims including an Argentinian organization an IP television provider providing North and South American content and a major textile manufacturer in Mexico Coincidentally recent attempts to browse the textile manufacturers website result in a 500 internal server error messageGiven the geographic dispersion of these victims the upstream connection to a Ukrainian IP and several other factors we believe it is highly unlikely that BRc4 was deployed in support of legitimate and sanctioned penetration testing activitiesOver the past year the fake Microsoft Security X509 certificate has been linked to 41 IP addresses These addresses follow a global geographic dispersion and are predominantly owned by large virtual private server VPS hosting providers Expanding our research beyond the two samples discussed above we have also identified an additional seven samples of BRc4 dating back to February 2021For Palo Alto Networks customers our products and services provide the following coverage associated with this groupThe emergence of a new penetration testing and adversary emulation capability is significant Yet more alarming is the effectiveness of BRc4 at defeating modern defensive EDR and AV detection capabilitiesOver the past 25 years this tool has evolved from a part-time hobby to a full-time development project with a growing customer base As this customer base has expanded into the hundreds the tool has gained increased attention across the cybersecurity domain from both legitimate penetration testers as well as malicious cyber actorsThe analysis of the two samples described in this blog as well as the advanced tradecraft used to package these payloads make it clear that malicious cyber actors have begun to adopt this capability We believe it is imperative that all security vendors create protections to detect BRc4 and that all organizations take proactive measures to defend against this toolNote that the Microsoft name and logo shown are an attempt to impersonate a legitimate organization and do not represent an actual
