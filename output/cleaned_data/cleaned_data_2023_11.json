labyrinthine infection chain to target Middle Eastern governments with a new initial access downloader Proofpoint has dubbed IronWind From July through October 2023 TA402 utilized three variations of this infection chainDropbox links XLL file attachments and RAR file attachmentswith each variant consistently leading to the download of a DLL containing the multifunctional malware In these campaigns TA402 also pivoted away from its use of cloud services like Dropbox API which Proofpoint researchers observed in activity from 2021 and 2022 to using actor-controlled infrastructure for C2 communicationAs of late October 2023 Proofpoint researchers had not observed any changes in targeting by TA402 an APT group that historically has operated in the interests of the Palestinian Territories nor identified any indications of an altered mandate despite the current conflict in the region It remains possible that this threat actor will redirect its resources as events continue to unfoldFigure 1 TA402 infection chain used from November 2021 to January 2022Figure 2 TA402 infection chain used in July 2023 campaignThe NET executable continued to use HTTPS POSTs and GETs to theconomicsnet for C2 and received JSON responses It passed authentication via a custom UserAgent string Mozilla50 Windows NT 100 Win64 x64 rvtag Geckoauth Firefox315 and almost certainly would have downloaded additional shellcode payloads Based on Proofpoint analysis this UserAgent is unique enough to be used for detection purposes Proofpoint researchers did not observe the fifth stage at the time of analysis but took note that the last stage payload contained unused code suggesting TA402 may be making further updates and adjustments to the malwareAugust 2023 activity In August 2023 TA402 shifted to sending an attached XLL file to load IronWind using as a lure instead of using a malicious PPAM file delivered via Drobox The machine translation of the lure is as follows List of persons and entities designated as terrorists by the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Authority TA402 used the same compromised Ministry of Foreign Affairs email account observed in the July activity As part of the initial infection process TA402 sent a base64 encoded check in to Request Inspectora third-party service for creating endpoints for HTTP requeststo exfiltrate some system informationOctober 2023 activity In October 2023 TA402 shifted a portion of its infection chain yet again This time the threat actor sent a RAR file attachment that contained a renamed version of tabcalexe for sideloading IronWind and propsysdll IronWind instead of using a malicious PPAM file delivered via Dropbox or an attached XLL file to load the malware The delivered malware again used Request Inspector for initial check in and a new TA402 C2 domain inclusive-economycomTA402 also continued to leverage a compromised Ministry of Foreign Affairs email account to send phishing emails with the lure 110 which translates to Report and Recommendations of the 110th Session on the War on Gaza Currently TA402 only appears to be using the conflict for lure purposes Additionally TA402 continues to phish indicating the conflict has not significantly disrupted the groups operationsDuring malware analysis Proofpoint researchers identified TA402 had failed to sanitize the groups PDB paths during malware development for multiple stages A YARA rule for hunting purposes is attached at the end of this blogBased on the following PDB paths Proofpoint researchers assess with moderate confidence that the IronWind malware project name is tornado and malware development is broken out by function including IA the IronWind dropper stager the stager DLL and payloadsTA402 regularly employs geofencing techniques to make detection of its malicious activity more difficult This aspect of the threat actors tactics techniques and procedures has remained consistent since at least 2020 Even with the more elaborate infection chains observed in 2023 TA402 continues to include URLs that will at times redirect to decoy documents hosted onlegitimate document hosting platforms if the geofencing is not bypassedProofpoint researchers attributed the campaigns to TA402 based on tactics techniques and victimology The 2023 campaigns share similarly themed lures as historical TA402 activity and retain a focus on Arabic-speaking targets located in the Middle East Over the years TA402 has consistently targeted government entities based in the Middle East and North Africa at times going after the same targets repeatedly TA402s use of compromised Ministry of Foreign Affairs email accounts geofencing and decoy documents additionally contributed to the attributionBased on Proofpoints tracking of this threat actor since 2020 TA402 remains a persistent and innovative threat actor that routinely retools its attack methods and malware in support of its cyber espionage mandate Its ongoing use of geofencing and decoy documents continues to serve its detection evasion efforts While TA402 is an intelligence collection focused threat actor with a specific interest in Middle Eastern and North African government entities the group could find itself under direction to adjust its targeting or social engineering lures in reaction to the ongoing Israel-Hamas

services and more to support our mission to defend against cyber crimeGet the latest insights from cyber security experts at the frontlines of threat intelligence and incident responseLearn more about us and our mission to help organizations defend against cyber crimeIn late 2022 Mandiant responded to a disruptive cyber physical incident in which the Russia-linked threat actor Sandworm targeted a Ukrainian critical infrastructure organization This incident was a multi-event cyber attack that leveraged a novel technique for impacting industrial control systems ICS operational technology OT The actor first used OT-level living off the land LotL techniques to likely trip the victims substation circuit breakers causing an unplanned power outage that coincided with mass missile strikes on critical infrastructure across Ukraine Sandworm later conducted a second disruptive event by deploying a new variant of CADDYWIPER in the victims IT environmentThis attack represents the latest evolution in Russias cyber physical attack capability which has been increasingly visible since Russias invasion of Ukraine The techniques leveraged during the incident suggest a growing maturity of Russias offensive OT arsenal including an ability to recognize novel OT threat vectors develop new capabilities and leverage different types of OT infrastructure to execute attacks By using LotL techniques the actor likely decreased the time and resources required to conduct its cyber physical attack While Mandiant was unable to determine the initial intrusion point our analysis suggests the OT component of this attack may have been developed in as little as two months This indicates that the threat actor is likely capable of quickly developing similar capabilities against other OT systems from different original equipment manufacturers OEMs leveraged across the worldBased on our analysis the intrusion began on or prior to June 2022 and culminated in two disruptive events on October 10 and 12 2022 While we were unable to identify the initial access vector into the IT environment Sandworm gained access to the OT environment through a hypervisor that hosted a supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA management instance for the victims substation environment Based on evidence of lateral movement the attacker potentially had access to the SCADA system for up to three monthsOn October 10 the actor leveraged an optical disc ISO image named aiso to execute a native MicroSCADA binary in a likely attempt to execute malicious control commands to switch off substations The ISO file contained at least the followingBased on a September 23 timestamp of lunvbs there was potentially a two-month time period from when the attacker gained initial access to the SCADA system to when they developed the OT capability Although we were not able to fully recover the ICS command execution implemented by the binary we are aware that the attack resulted in an unscheduled power outage Figure 1 contains a visualization of the execution chain resulting in the disruptive OT eventTwo days after the OT event Sandworm deployed a new variant of CADDYWIPER in the victims IT environment to cause further disruption and potentially to remove forensic artifacts However we note that the wiper deployment was limited to the victims IT environment and did not impact the hypervisor or the SCADA virtual machine This is unusual since the threat actor had removed other forensic artifacts from the SCADA system in a possible attempt to cover their tracks which would have been enhanced by the wiper activity This could indicate a lack of coordination across different individuals or operational subteams involved in the attackA deeper dive on the attack lifecycle and OT capability can be found in the Technical Analysis section of the blog postThis attack represents an immediate threat to Ukrainian critical infrastructure environments leveraging the MicroSCADA supervisory control system Given Sandworm's global threat activity and the worldwide deployment of MicroSCADA products asset owners globally should take action to mitigate their tactics techniques and procedures against IT and OT systems Furthermore our analysis of the activity suggests Russia would be capable of developing similar capabilities against other SCADA systems and programming languages beyond MicroSCADA and SCIL We urge asset owners to review and implement the following recommendations to mitigate and detect this activityThis research was made possible thanks to the hard work of many people not listed on the byline Mandiant would like to acknowledge the Security Service of Ukraine SBU for their continued partnership and contributions to this report as well as their on-going collaboration This incident response engagement was funded through the UKs Ukraine Cyber Programme cross-government Conflict Stability and Security Fund and delivered by the United Kingdoms Foreign Commonwealth and Development OfficeWhen leveraging GOGETTER Sandworm utilized a Systemd service unit to maintain persistence on systems A Systemd service unit allows for a program to be run under certain conditions and in this case it was used to execute the GOGETTER binary on rebootThe Systemd configuration file leveraged by Sandworm enabled the group to maintain persistence on systems The value WantedBy defines when the program should be run in the configuration used by Sandworm the setting multi-usertarget means that the program will be run when the host has reached a state when it will accept users logging on for example after successful power on This enables GOGETTER to maintain persistence across reboots The ExecStart value specifies the path of the program to be run which in this case was GOGETTERWhen deploying GOGETTER Mandiant observed Sandworm leverage Systemd service units designed to masquerade as legitimate or seemingly legitimate servicesSandworm utilized a novel technique to impact the OT environment by executing code within an End-of-Life EOL MicroSCADA control system and issuing commands that impacted the victims connected substations Table 1 summarizes the malicious files containing the new OT capability We note that given the attackers use of anti-forensics techniques we were not able to recover all the artifacts from the

impact the OT systems Sandworm accessed the hypervisor that hosted a SCADA management instance for the victims substation environment and leveraged an ISO image named aiso as a virtual CD-ROM The system was configured to permit inserted CD-ROMs to autorun The ISO file at minimum contained the following files lunvbs and nbat as both files are referenced within the D volume and therefore contained within aiso The inserted ISO led to at least the following command lines executionBased on forensic analysis we believe lunvbs contents are the following Figure 6The contents in Figure 6 indicate that lunvbs executes nbat Additional fragments recovered include text consistent with Windows command line execution Figure 7 This fragment was identified by analyzing images from the host Reconstruction of the hosts anti-virus logs indicates lunvbs and nbat were executed in close time proximity Because of this and the reference to the attackers ISO folder path we believe that the command fragment in Figure 7 is likely the contents of nbatThe syntax of the command fragment includes scilcexe a native utility that is part of the MicroSCADA software suite The utility is located in the scprogexec folder within the MicroSCADA installation directory amongst other utilities libraries and resources used by MicroSCADA The impacted MicroSCADA system was running an EOL software version that allowed default access to the SCIL-API The -do flag specifies a SCIL program file to execute Figure 8 Lastly the command supplies a file named s1txt in the packscil folder of the attacker's ISO We assess packscils1txt is likely a file containing SCIL commands the attackers executed in MicroSCADA This file was unrecoverable at the time of analysisWhile we were unable to identify the SCIL commands executed we believe they were probably commands to open circuit breakers in the victims substation environments The SCIL commands would have caused the MicroSCADA server to relay the commands to the substation RTUs via either the IEC-60870-5-104 protocol for TCPIP connections or the IEC-60870-5-101 protocol for serial connectionsTwo days following the OT activity Sandworm deployed a new variant of CADDYWIPER throughout the IT environment This CADDYWIPER variant compiled in October 2022 contains some minor functionality improvements that allow threat actors to resolve functions at runtime We have observed CADDYWIPER deployed across several verticals in Ukraine including the government and financial sectors throughout Russias invasion of UkraineSandworm deployed CADDYWIPER in this operation via two Group Policy Objects GPO from a Domain Controller using TANKTRAP TANKTRAP is a utility written in PowerShell that utilizes Windows group policy to spread and launch a wiper We

VAMP Many changes have been made in SpyC23s development however there are notable overlaps with these older families and the taxonomy is less distinctThere is a non-weaponized version of Skipped Messenger SHA-1 6e1867bd841f4dc16bef21b5a958eec7a6497c4e that shares the same Firebase service hostname skippedtestinappfirebaseiocom as the malicious version As the Talos report noted Skipped was originally a legitimate dating app The Google Play store version was last updated in August 2021Like most malicious Android apps these apps ask the user to enable permissions that facilitate spyware

these APKs contains application code that is obfuscated On emulated Android devices the apps flash and repeatedly cycle through prompts even after the requested permissions have been grantedComparing these new versions with older SpyC23 variants there is significant overlap in package names which fortifies the relationship between the old and new versions In the image below the older version on the left houses malicious activity in the updatebbm package and the version we discovered on the right houses similar subpackages in the appssklitepacJava packageThe overlaps continue in the class names The actor frequently names classes after peoples names as outlined in the rccolatasranrccol package structureThese applications are quite large making analysis of each class impractical Instead we will focus on several interesting classes and methodsThis class handles some communications to the C2 Of note the class contains code that pertains to the user uninstalling the application The SendToServerTask subclass logs when the user is in a dangerous menu and parses input containing the active menu name for the English words apps or applications as well as the Arabic word for ApplicationsThis class is responsible for much of the apps upload request handling acting as an interface between the app and the C2 server Brodie contains a method named isProbablyArabic suggesting again that these apps are used against Arabic-speaking targetsThis service enables the spywares call recording feature The class is imported from an external library libcallrecfixso and runs as a service The Unix library is based on at least two open-source Android call recording projects though neither are actively maintained This was implemented in 2020 and has been a staple of SpyC23 iterations since The library is a binary compiled for each of the apps compatible architecturesThis class is notable because it contains code that spans back to much earlier versions of Arid Vipers Android spyware We identified a 2017 GnatSpy sample from Trend Micros Arid Viper reporting that shares the same upload functionality through a subclass JsDirServiceThis class loads methods from external libraries libRoamsso and lib-uoilso The code imports several functions related to manufacturer-specific implementations including Huawei Oppo and XiaomiLike older versions of SpyC23 this class has logic to parse and decode the C2 server details from strings stored inside the lib-uoilso and related binaries The strings are encoded partially in Base64 with an additional layer likely on top to parse the correct C2 server URIs The previous technique of dropping the strings before and after the hyphen remain and further substitution removes spaces and underscores replacing them with hyphensThe C2 servers used by these apps continue the longstanding Arid Viper domain naming scheme of a hyphenated hostname that uses Western-sounding peoples names The primary C2 servers areWe have included additional network indicators associated with app features that are unique to the APKs analyzed including Google Cloud project hostnames and Firebase messaging hostnamesThe discovery of these

as well as foreign affairs ministries and embassies in South Asian countries DoNot APT has been observed using both Windows and Android malware in its operationsDuring the same period an enhanced version of this Android malware came to our attention In this updated version two-layer string encryption was eliminated and new functionalities were introduced These enhancements encompassed the capability to steal conversations from messaging applications screen recording taking photos using the devices camera and capturing screenshots This revised file was also mentioned in the same article and its hash was specified as b2b857553e0bbf098d35198a6dead03798fcf786c086e9f50e4e1f5eaeaad5e8 AppsUpdateapkSimilar to the previous version some of these updated malicious files posed as messaging apps while others pretended to be settings or app update applications and the package names included Chinese characters The figure below depicts the features incorporated into the updated version of the malware with the new features highlighted in redAs previously mentioned the latest version of the malware has introduced several new features These additions encompass recording VoIP calls from messaging apps capturing clipboard contents downloading payloads during runtime gathering browser history as well as collecting other Personally Identifiable Information PII data and ShareMe activity Notably in this updated version the malware has expanded its target list to include additional messaging and social media applications The figure below illustrates the disparities between the malware that emerged in April 2023 on the right and the most recently updated malware on the leftAPK Metadata InformationThe malware employs the Firebase Cloud Messaging FCM server as its initial Command and Control CC server to receive commands The FCM server is responsible for various functions including obtaining the new CC server URL setting up databases deleting the application sending text messages from the infected device adding contacts call log entries and downloading the APK fileBelow we have listed the commands received via the FCM serverThe malware stores an alternative CC server URL in a text file named KYLK00txt The malware has two hardcoded CC server URLs embedded in its code namely hxxpscapsupbuzz and hxxpstoolgptbuzz The choice of CC URL in the text file depends on the below scenarioThe malware employs the Retrofit Library for its communication with the CC server Within the malware two distinct Retrofit instances are identified one is specifically for hxxpscapsupbuzz while the other is designated for the URL stored in KYLK00txt The first Retrofit instance is solely responsible for transmitting device information and providing responses once the malware acquires the CC URL from the FCM server On the other hand the second Retrofit instance is extensively utilized throughout the malwares code primarily for sending various types of stolen data to various endpointsThe implemented CC architecture ensures that the malware can sustain communication with backup servers in case of communication failures with the current serverThe malware uses the Accessibility service to track user interactions with messaging and social media applications Below is a list of targeted applications with the highlighted ones indicating the new additions in the current variantBy employing the resource identifier of the targeted application the malware attempts to locate user interface elements associated with calls and messages It then extracts relevant data including the recipients name message content message status and timestampsThe malware saves this extracted data from messaging and social media applications into SQLite databases Specifically the malware creates 22 separate databases to store each type of stolen information The figure below illustrates the process of creating these databasesThe malware has enrolled a Notification Listener service that observes notifications related to incomingoutgoing voice or video calls within specific messaging and social media applications When the victim receives a call the malware initiates the audio recording of that callAfter the notification for calls made through targeted applications is removed the malware dispatches an end call state signal to the audio recording service class and subsequently stops the audio recordingAs explained earlier the malware receives a range of commands from the FCM server Among these commands the ccinst command is responsible for downloading an additional APK file titled Resource1apk from the URL provided with the command received from the FCM serverUpon obtaining the payload from the server the malware accesses the payload component using the Dex ClassLoader The figure below illustrates the classes loaded by the malware through the use of the loadClass method While conducting dynamic analysis we were unable to retrieve the additional payload which could potentially introduce other malicious functionalitiesThe malware stores flags corresponding to various categories of exfiltrated data in a GeoFlag database Depending on the values of these flags the malware transmits the stolen data to the CC serverBelow is the comprehensive list of data that the malware can pilfer from a compromised device and sends them to the CC serverWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against attackers We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given belowCyble Research Lab

custom Lazarus Group detection rules we track this intrusion set as REF7001REF7001 Execution FlowThis execution kicked off the primary malware execution flow of the REF7001 intrusion culminating in KANDYKORNThe initial breach was orchestrated via a camouflaged Python application designed and advertised as an arbitrage bot targeted at blockchain engineers This application was distributed as a zip file titled Cross-Platform Bridgeszip Decompressing it reveals a Mainpy script accompanied by a folder named orderbookrecorder housing 13 Python scriptsCross-Platform Bridgeszip folder structureThe victim manually ran the Mainpy script via their PyCharm IDE Python interpreterInitially the Mainpy script appears benign It imports the accompanying Python scripts as modules and seems to execute some mundane functionsWhile analyzing the modules housed in the orderbookrecorder folder one file -- Watcherpy -- clearly stood out and we will see whyMainpy acts as the initial trigger importing Watcherpy as a module that indirectly executes the script The Python interpreter runs every top-level statement in Watcherpy sequentiallyThe script starts off by establishing local directory paths and subsequently attempts to generate a log folder at the specified location If the folder already exists the script remains passiveCreating a folder within the Python application directory structure and name it logThe script pre-defines a testSpeedpy file path destined for the just created log folder and assigns it to the output variable The function importnetworklib is then defined Within it a Google Drive URL is initializedUtilizing the Python urllib library the script fetches content from this URL and stashes it in the sargs variable In case of retrieval errors it defaults to returning the operating system's name Subsequently the content from Google Drive now in sargs is written into the testSpeedpy fileMalicious downloader function importnetworklibConnect to Google Drive url and

written to the UsersShared directoryFinderTools executes sldStage 2 involves the execution of an obfuscated binary we have named SUGARLOADER which is utilized twice under two separate names sld and logSUGARLOADER is first observed at Userssharedsld The second instance of SUGARLOADER renamed to log is used in the persistence mechanism REF7001 implements with DiscordSUGARLOADER is used for initial access on the machine and initializing the environment for the final stage This binary is obfuscated using a binary packer limiting what can be seen with static analysisThe start function of this binary consists of a jump JMP to an undefined address This is common for binary packersExecuting the macOS file object tool otool -l log lists all the sections that will be loaded at runtimemodinitfunc contains initialization functions The C compiler places static constructors here This is the code used to unpack the binary in memoryA successful method of reverse engineering such files is to place a breakpoint right after the execution of initialization functions and then take a snapshot of the process's virtual memory When the breakpoint is hit the code will already be decrypted in memory and can be analyzed using traditional methodsSUGARLOADER VirusTotal DetectionsThe primary purpose of SUGARLOADER is to connect to a Command and Control server C2 in order to download a final stage payload we refer to as KANDYKORN and execute it directly in memorySUGARLOADER checks for the existence of a configuration file at LibraryCachescomapplesafarick If the configuration file is missing it will be downloaded and created via a default C2 address provided as a command line argument to the sld binary In our sample the C2 address was 2325422690 over TCP port 443 We provide additional information about the C2 in the Network Infrastructure section belowSUGARLOADER C2 established and configuration file downloadSUGARLOADER writing configuration fileThe configuration file is encrypted using RC4 and the encryption key in the Observations section is hardcoded within SUGARLOADER itself The comapplesafarick file is utilized by both SUGARLOADER and KANDYKORN for establishing secure network communicationscomputerId is a randomly generated string identifying the victims computerA C2 server can either be identified with a fully qualified URL c2urls or with an IP address and port c2ipddress It supports two C2 servers one as the main server and the second one as a fallback The specification or hardcoding of multiple servers like this is commonly used by malicious actors to ensure their connection with the victim is persistent should the original C2 be taken down or blocked sleepInterval is the default sleeping interval for the malware between separate actionsOnce the configuration file is read into memory and decrypted the next step is to initialize a connection to the remote server All the communication between the victims computer and the C2 server is detailed in the Network Protocol sectionSUGARLOADER reflectively loads a binary KANDYKORN and then creates a new file initially named appname which we refer to as HLOADER which we took directly from the process code signatures signing identifierSUGARLOADER reflective binary load alertSUGARLOADER creates HLOADERHLOADER code signature identifierPseudocode for SUGARLOADER

connects to the C2 server and waits for a payload to be received Another alert is generated when the new payload KANDYKORN is loaded into memoryReflective Dylib Load Alert for KANDYKORNKANDYKORN is the final stage of this execution chain and possesses a full-featured set of capabilities to access and exfiltrate data from the victims computer Elastic Security Labs was able to retrieve this payload from one C2 server which hadnt been deactivated yetKANDYCORN processes are forked and run in the background as daemons before loading their configuration file from LibraryCachescomapplesafarick The configuration file is read into memory then decrypted using the same RC4 key and parsed for C2 settings The communication protocol is similar to prior stages using the victim ID value for authenticationOnce communication is established KANDYKORN awaits commands from the server This is an interesting characteristic in that the malware waits for commands instead of polling for commands This would reduce the number of endpoint and network artifacts generated and provide a way to limit potential discoveryEach command is represented by an integer being transmitted followed by the data that is specific to each action Below is a list of the available commands KANDYKORN providesAction Exit command where the program gracefully existsName respbasicinfoAction Gathers information about the system such as hostname uid osinfo and image path of the current process and reports back to the serverrespbasicinfo routineName respfiledirAction Lists content of a directory and format the output similar to ls -al including type name permissions size acl path and access timerespfiledir routineName respfilepropAction Recursively read a directory and count the number of files number of subdirectories and total sizerespfileprop routineName respfileuploadAction Used by the adversary to upload a file from their C2 server to the victims computer This command specifies a path creates it and then proceeds to download the file content and write it to the victims computerName respfiledownAction Used by the adversary to transfer a file from the victims computer to their infrastructureName respfilezipdownAction Archive a directory and exfiltrate it to the C2 server The newly created archives name has the following patterntmptempXXXXXXXrespfilezipdown routine Name respfilewipeAction Overwrites file content to zero and deletes the file This is a common technique used to impede recovering the file through digital forensics on the filesystemrespfilewipe routineName respproclistAction Lists all running processes on the system along with their PID UID and other informationName respprockillAction Kills a process by specified PIDrespprockill routineName respcmdsendAction Executes a command on the system by using a pseudoterminalName respcmdrecvAction Reads the command output from the previous command respcmdsendName respcmdcreateAction Spawns a shell on the system and communicates with it via a pseudoterminal Once the shell process is executed commands are read and written through the devpts

to the victims machine This is used by the adversary to update the C2 hostname that should be used to retrieve commands fromName respsleepAction Sleeps for a number of secondsKANDYKORN is an advanced implant with a variety of capabilities to monitor interact with and avoid detection It utilizes reflective loading a direct-memory form of execution that may bypass detectionsAll the executables that communicate with the C2 both stage 3 and stage 4 are using the same protocol All the data is encrypted with RC4 and uses the same key previously referenced in the configuration fileBoth samples implement wrappers around the send-and-receive system calls It can be observed in the following pseudocode that during the send routine the buffer is first encrypted and then sent to the socket whereas when data is received it is first decrypted and then processedsend routinerecv routineWhen the malware first connects to the C2 during the initialization phase there is a handshake that needs to be validated in order to proceed Should the handshake fail the attack would stop and no other commands would be processedOn the client side a random number is generated and sent to the C2 which replies with a nonce variable The client then computes a challenge with the random number and the received nonce and sends the result back to the server If the challenge is successful and the server accepts the connection it replies with a constant such as 0x41C3372 which appears in the analyzed sampleHandshake routineOnce the connection is established the client sends its ID and awaits commands from the server Any subsequent data sent or received from here is serialized following a common schema used to serialize binary objects First the length of the content is sent then the payload followed by a return code which indicates if any error occurredOverview of communication protocolDuring REF7001 the adversary was observed communicating with network infrastructure to collect various payloads and loaders for different stages of the intrusionAs detailed in the Stage 1 section above the link to the initial malware archive Cross-Platform Bridgeszip was provided in a direct message on a popular blockchain Discord server This archive was hosted on a Google Drive httpsdrivegooglecomfiled1KW5nQ8MZccug6Mp4QtKyWLT3HIZzHNIL2 but this was removed shortly after the archive was downloadedThroughout the analysis of the REF7001 intrusion there were two C2 servers observed2325422690 is the C2 IP used for the sld file SUGARLOADER malware How this IP is used for C2 is highlighted in the stage 2 section aboveAs noted above this is likely an attempt to typosquat a legitimate domain for a decentralized NFT data platform We do not have any information to indicate that the legitimate company is involved in this intrusionAll registered domains 48 as of this writing for 1921196443 are included in the observables bundleThe domain reported on Reddit was

        "text": "The Android malware deployed in this malicious campaign extensively uses the same Firebase databases used by Skipped however both the malware and the non-malicious application use their own set of distinct credentials including API keys and Client Application IDs This observation indicates that the malware developers had access to the same Firebase project and backend database that are used by the non-malicious dating application and generated their own set of credentialsTalos also considered though assessed it was unlikely that Skippeds Firebase databases were configured in test mode made publicly available and abused by Arid Viper Test mode allows a developer to quickly set up a database for testing purposes which makes it available to everyone who knows the URL This mode needs to be set when the database is first created and is only available for 30 days After this duration the database is locked and needs to be specifically re-configured to provide public access The passive DNS data for the Skipped Firebase projects domain shows that the URL for the database was first seen on August 9 2021 while Arid Vipers malware started using this infrastructure beginning on November 11 2022 Given the malware used Skippeds Firebase project almost a year after the infrastructure was set up and well outside the 30 day window of public access it is unlikely Arid Viper leveraged unintentional public access to the databaseFurthermore this mode does not provide any management capabilities for the overall Firebase project but rather only provides data read and write capabilities to the backend database The generation of API keys and registration of the Android malware for the project would still need to be provisioned on the projects management consoleFinally Talos found no public evidence of the FirebaseGoogle Cloud project being compromised such that it may be used by any parties except the projects original creators This supports our assessment that Skipped developers likely shared their Firebase project with Arid Viper operatorsAs seen below the malware used by Arid Viper in this campaign is very similar to remote access trojans RATs used by the threat actor in previous campaigns The previous versions of the malware all allude to the Skipped application either via references in Android package names or in the malwares Graphical User Interface GUIOur analysis uncovered an extended web of companies that create dating-themed applications that are similar or identical to Skipped Given the aforementioned connections between Arid Vipers mobile malware and Skipped we assess that Arid Viper operators may seek to leverage the infrastructure andor names of these additional applications in future malicious campaignsThe publisher of Skipped a company called Skipped GmbH was registered and is headquartered in Germany and appears to be linked to a multitude of seemingly non-malicious dating applications published by companies in Singapore and Dubai We found that the domains used by these additional companies to distribute their dating applications which are available on the Google and Apple application stores were registered by Skipped GmbH Most of these applications provide their users with a chatting service where no face-to-face interaction is possible During these conversations the application will interrupt and request the user buys coins in order to continue the interaction This feature is notable as if there is a current or potential connection between Arid Viper and these applications it could generate revenue for the APT operatorsThe following online dating applications that are connected to Skipped GmbH can be installed from the Google Play Store or the Apple App StoreWe were able to connect Skipped GmbH the central entity in this ecosystem to individuals operating under multiple monikers Pivoting off the individuals we were able to identify at least three different yet related companies in Germany that author and distribute mobile applications that are usually dating-themedTalos discovered multiple domains registered by Skipped GmbH that serve as product home pages and host artifacts like application service agreements The applications that these domains pertain to are all romance and dating themed and are distributed on the App Stores using a variety of publisher entities A high-level timeline of events for the companies domains and applications involved in this ecosystem is shown belowAll websites listed above use the exact same template to present their content with minor variations in the content itself captions and images The websites provide links to download the application from application stores in the website footer The legal agreement and publisher information on these sites however may not refer to Skipped GmbH In fact many of the websites list companies based out of different countriesAlthough there is a concrete connection between Skipped GmbH and the domains associated with these applications as evidenced by their domain registration information it is currently unclear if there is a direct relationship between Skipped GmbH and the other developers listed above that distribute these applicationsTalos produced a graph to map the connections between the application companies domains and websites which can be seen below This graph includes a connection to Arid Vipers Android malware based on the malwares overlapping use of Firebase with Skipped as explained above At the center of the graph lies Skipped GmbH which is used for registering domains and establishing websites for the various dating applications These applications and their websites are connected to additional developers and publishers located globally For example the Joula application is distributed by a company called NYUTAINMENT PTE LTD based out of Singapore However the domain for Joula joulaapp was registered by Skipped GmbHArid Vipers latest campaign which Talos observed occurring since at least April 2022 targets Arabic-speaking Android users through mobile malware that masquerades as application updates Arid Viper has a history of disguising their malware as updates either for dating applications or for popular messaging applications such as WhatsApp Signal or Telegram The attackers typically send targets a link to a tutorial video for the application which is posted on a media-sharing website like YouTubeThe tutorial video will provide a step-by-step account of all features of the application and instructions on how to operate it in Arabic suggesting a specific targeting of Arabic-speaking individuals One such video depicts an individual narrating in Arabic in Levantine dialect A URL is provided in the videos description which directs to an attacker-controlled domain that serves a copy of Arid Vipers APK malwareTalos identified a YouTube account that hosted such a video The account was created on March 17 2022 and has uploaded only one video suggesting Arid Viper may use such accounts to host a limited number of videos at a time The video as shown in the screen capture above had approximately 50 views at the time of writingAs previously mentioned some of the malware deployed in this campaign used Googles Firebase platform as C2 infrastructure for the malicious applications The Firebase platform primarily serves as a C2 channel to issue commands and to download and upload files The platform also has the ability to provide a new C2 server address to the malware so that it can switch frm the Firebase platform to another attacker-controlled C2 host One of the Firebase projects used by Arid Viper in this campaign dates back to 2021 and has some non-malicious mobile APKs associated with it indicating operators have been trying to create test and popularize other APK software out of the same account for yearsArid Vipers Android malware has a number of features that enable the operators to surreptitiously collect sensitive information from victims devices and deploy additional executables The malware uses native code to hide some of its activities meaning it can leverage Androids capability that allows for the execution of assembly-based shared libraries Android applications can usually be built from Java code however for performance reasons applications have the ability to load libraries which are compiled into native code shared libraries This native code is also harder to analyze and reverse engineerOnce deployed the malware attempts to hide itself on a victim machine by disabling system or security notifications from the operating system The malware completely disables notifications on Samsung mobile devices and on any device with an Android package that contains the word security The malware makes notifications less visible on Huawei Google Oppo and Xiaomi mobile devicesThis malware loads a library typically called libuoilso or libdaliaso which exports four main functions Each of these functions will return the name of an administration package installed by vendors on their version of the Android Open Source Project AOSPThese names will then be used to hide notifications from the security packages from the four vendors mentioned above It is unclear why these vendors require a different obfuscation procedure since the code strings are not obfuscated in the native code libraryThe malware is configured to obtain a number of permissions from the infected device including the ability toThese capabilities and the code used to implement them are explored in greater detail belowFrom the capability point of view this RAT exhibits all the classic functionalities of an Android-based RAT including system fingerprinting data exfiltration and payload deployment to name a fewThe malware has the capability to download additional malware which is typically masquerading as updates for legitimate applications It can also display notifications that specific applications have updates available potentially prompting users to install the malicious updates The malware has the capability to download rename and run the following applicationsThe malware can retrieve the following SIM information for dual SIM devices for each SIMIt can also retrieve the following battery information for the deviceThe malware can identify the manufacturer of the device if it is one of the followingIt can get the following network informationFinally the malware is able to retrieve additional information includingThe Android implant can ask the current C2 for an updated C2 domain and store it in its configuration as shown belowIt can also exfiltrate credentials collected from Facebook and relay them to the C2 serverThe implant has the ability to record telephone calls made on the compromised device This is done by recording the MIC audio source capturing the recording to a specified location on disk and subsequently uploading all files in the directory to the C2 serverThe malware can also capture SMS messages received by the device send new SMS messages and make calls to phone numbers specified by the C2Finally the implant records the following information for all SMS

undocumented functionalities of the HTTPsys driver to extract payloads from incoming HTTP traffic Multiple observed variants of LIONTAIL-associated malware suggest Scarred Manticore generates a tailor-made implant for each compromised server allowing the malicious activities to blend into and be undiscernible from legitimate network trafficThe evolution in the tools and capabilities of Scarred Manticore demonstrates the progress the Iranian actors have undergone over the last few years The techniques utilized in recent Scarred Manticore operations are notably more sophisticated compared to previous activities CPR has tied to IranIn this article we provide a technical analysis of the latest tools and the evolution of Scarred Manticores activity over time This report details our understanding of Scarred Manticore most notably its novel malware framework LIONTAIL but also provides an overview of other toolsets we believe are used by the same actor some of which were publicly exposed in the past This includes but is not limited to tools used in the intrusion into the Albanian government infrastructure web shells observed in high-profile attacks in the Middle East and recently reported WINTAPIX driver-based implantsLIONTAIL is a malware framework that includes a set of custom shellcode loaders and memory resident shellcode payloads One of its components is the LIONTAIL backdoor written in C It is a lightweight but rather sophisticated passive backdoor installed on Windows servers that enables attackers to execute commands remotely through HTTP requests The backdoor sets up listeners for the list of URLs provided in its configuration and executes payloads from requests sent by attackers to those URLsThe LIONTAIL backdoor components are the main implants utilized in the latest Scarred Manticore intrusions Utilizing access from a publicly facing server the threat actor chains a set of passive implants to access internal resources The internal instances of the LIONTAIL backdoors weve seen so far either listen on HTTPs similar to the internet-facing instances or in some cases use named pipes to facilitate remote code executionWe observed 2 methods of backdoor installation on the compromised Windows servers standalone executables and DLLs loaded through search order hijacking by Windows services or legitimate processesWhen installed as a DLL the malware exploits the absence of some DLLs on Windows Server OS distributions the backdoor is dropped to the system folderCwindowssystem32aswlanapidllorwlbsctrldll By default neither of theseexist on Windows Server installations Depending on the Windows Server version the malicious DLL is then loaded either directly by other processes such as Explorerexe or the threat actors enable specific services disabled by default that require those DLLsIn the case ofwlbsctrldll the DLL is loaded at the start of theIKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modulesservice Forwlanapidll the actors enableExtensible Authentication Protocolscexe config Eaphost startautoscexe start EaphostIn instances where LIONTAIL is deployed as an executable a noteworthy characteristic observed in some is the attempt to disguise the executable asCyvera Console a component of Cortex XDRThe malware starts by performing a one-byte XOR decryption of a structure containing the malware configuration which is represented with the following structureMany LIONTAIL samples contain tailor-made configurations which add multiple other custom URLs that match existing web folders on the compromised server As the URLs for the existing folders are already taken by the actual IIS service the generated payloads contain additional random dictionary words in the path These ensure the malware communication blends into legitimate traffic helping to make it more inconspicuousThehostelement of all prefixes in the configuration consists of a single plus sign a strong wildcard that matches all possible host names A strong wildcard is useful when an application needs to serve requests addressed to one or more relative URLs regardless of how those requests arrive on the machine or what site host or IP address they specify in their Host headersTo understand how the malware configures listeners on those prefixes and how the approach changes with time we pause for a short introduction to the Windows HTTP stackA port-sharing mechanism which allows multiple HTTP services to share the same TCP port and IP address was introduced in Windows Server 2003 This mechanism is encapsulated withinHTTPsys a kernel-mode driver that assumes the responsibility of processing HTTP requests listens to incoming HTTP requests and directs them to the relevant user-mode processes or services for further handlingThe process of receiving and processing requests for specific URL prefixes by an application or in our case malware can be outlined as followsFirst the shellcode registers the URL prefixes with HTTPsys using the following IOCTLsAfter registering the URL prefixes the backdoor initiates a loop responsible for handling the incoming requests The loop continues until it gets the request from a URL equal to theendstringprovided in the backdoors configurationThe backdoor receives requests from HTTPsys using 0x124036 UlReceiveHttpRequestIoctlIOCTLThe decrypted payload has the following structureThe malware creates a new thread and runs the shellcode in memory For some reason it uses shellcodeoutput and shellcodeoutputsizein the request message as pointers to the respective data in memoryTo encrypt the response the malware chooses a random byte XOR-encodes the data using it as a key prepends the key to the result and then base64-encodes the entire result before sending it back to the CC server using the IOCTL 0x12403F UlSendHttpResponseIoctlIn addition to PE implant Scarred Manticore uses a web shell-based version of the LIONTAIL shellcode loader The web shell is obfuscated in a similar manner to other Scarred Manticore NET payloads and web shellsThe web shell gets requests with 2 parametersBoth parameters are encrypted the same way as other communication XOR with the first byte followed by base64 encodingThe structure of shellcodes and of arguments sent to the web shell-based shellcode loader is identical to those used in the LIONTAIL backdoor which suggests that the artifacts observed are part of a bigger framework that allows the dynamic building of loaders and payloads depending on the actors access and needsDuring our research we also found loaders that have a similar internal structure to the LIONTAIL samples Instead of listening on URL prefixes this version gets its payloads from a named pipe and likely is designated to be installed on internal servers with no access to the public web The configuration of the malware is a bit differentIts noteworthy that unlike the HTTP version the malware doesnt employ any more advanced techniques for connecting to the named pipe reading from it and writing to it Instead it relies on standardkernel32dllAPIs such asCreateNamedPipe andReadFileWriteFileThe communication of named pipes-based LIONTAIL is identical to the HTTP version with the same encryption mechanism and the same structure of the payload which runs as a shellcode in memoryAfter the LIONTAIL loader decrypts the payload and its argument received from the attackers CC server it starts with parsing the argument It is a structure that describes a type of payload for the shellcode to execute and it is built differently depending on the type of payloadThe argument for the API execution has the following structureTo make things more complicated Scarred Manticore wraps the final payload in nested shellcodes For example one of the shellcodes received from the attackers runs another almost identical shellcode which in turn runs a final shellcode responsible for machine fingerprintingThe data gathered by this payload is collected by running specific Windows APIs or enumerating the registry keys and includes these componentsThe final structure which contains all the gathered information also has a place for error codes for the threat actor to use to figure out why some of the APIs they use dont work as expectedIn addition to using LIONTAIL Scarred Manticore was observed leveraging other custom componentsOn some of the compromised exchange servers the actors deployed LIONHEAD a tiny web forwarder LIONHEAD is also installed as a service using the same phantom DLL hijacking technique as LIONTAIL and utilizes similar mechanisms to forward the traffic directly to Exchange Web Services EWS endpointsLIONHEADs configuration is different from LIONTAILThe backdoor registers thelistenurlsprefixes in the same way as LIONTAIL and listens for requests For each request the backdoor copies the content type cookie and body and forwards it to theforwardserverforwardpathforward portspecified in the configuration Next the backdoor gets a response fromforwardserverand sends it back to the URL that received the original requestThis forwarder might be used to bypass the restrictions on external connections to EWS hide the real consumer of EWS data being external and consequently conceal data exfiltrationBased on our visibility into the latest wave of attacks that utilize LIONTAIL the observed victims are located across the Middle East region including Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Jordan Kuwait Oman Iraq and Israel The majority of the impacted entities belong togovernmenttelecommunications military andfinancialsectors as well as IT services providers However we also observed the infection on the Exchange servers belonging to a regional affiliate of a global non-profit humanitarian networkThe geographic region and the targeted profile are aligned with Iranian interests and in line with the typical victim profile that MOIS-affiliated clusters usually target in espionage operationsSince at least 2019 Scarred Manticore deployed unique tools on compromised Internet-facing Windows servers in the Middle East region During these years their toolset went through significant development It began as open-source-based web-deployed proxies and over time evolved to become a diverse and powerful toolset that utilizes both custom-written and open-source componentsThe web shell used by the threat actor has the internal versionTunna v11gonly version 11a is available on Github The most significant change from the open-source version is the encryption of requests and responses by XORing the data with the pre-defined stringszEncryptionKeyand appending the constant stringKSUFFIXat the endOver time the code was refactored and lost its resemblance to Tunna We track this and all further versions as FOXSHELLThe biggest changes resulted from organizing multiple entities into classes using an objective-oriented approach The following class structure persists in most of the FOXSHELL versionsAll the functionality responsible for encrypting the traffic moved to a separateEncryptionModuleclass This class loads a NET DLL embedded in a base64-encoded string inside the body of FOXSHELL and invokes itsencryptanddecryptmethodsThe embedded encryption modules name isXOROdll and its classEncryptionXOROimplements decrypt and encrypt methods the same way as the Tunna-based web shell using the same hardcoded valuesAll requests to the web shell are also encapsulated within a class calledPackage which handles differentPackageTypes Data Config OK Dispose or Error The PackageType is defined by the first byte of the package and depending on the type of Package the web shell parses the package and applies the configuration opens a new socket to the remote machine specified in the configuration and applies a new EncryptionDll if provided or disposes of the existing socket or proxies the connection if the package is type DataThis version of the web shell is still unobfuscated and its internal version is specified in the codeThe web shell also contains the default EncryptionDll embedded inside The modules name isBase64dll and the encryption class which is misspelled asBsae64 exposes the encrypt and decrypt methods However both are just simple base64 encodingAlthough this simple encoding could be done in the code of the web shell itself the existence of other embedded DLLs such asXOROdlldescribed previously and the ability to provide yet another EncryptionDll on the configuration stage implies that the attackers prefer to control which specific type of encryption they want to use by default in certain environmentsOther changes in this version are the renaming of the PackageTypeConfigtoRDPconfig andConfigPackagetoRDPConfigPackage indicating the actors are focused on proxying RDP connections The code of these classes remains the sameFinally another condition in the code handles the case of the web shell receiving a non-empty parameterWV-RESETwhich calls a function to shut down the proxy socket and sends anOKresponse back to the attackersThe details of the samples may vary but in all of them the FOXHELL is compiled as DLL and embedded inside the base web shell in base64 The compiled DLL is loaded withSystemReflectionAssemblyLoad and then theProcessRequestmethod from it is invoked The DLL is written in NET and has the name patternAppWebrandomdll which indicates an ASPNET dynamically compiled DLLTheAppWebDLL is affected by the class and method obfuscation and all the strings are encrypted with a combination of Base64 XOR with the first byte and AESWhen the web shell is compiled into DLL it contains the initialization stub which ensures that the web shell listens on the correct URI In this case the initialization happens in the following piece of codeOr after deobfuscationThis initialization sets the FOXSHELL to listen to the requests on the relative path1aspx which we observed as an unused artifact in other web shells related to attacks involving LIONTAILInternally the DLL has the same 15 version of FOXSHELL which includes theWV-RESETparameter to stop the proxy and the same defaultBsae64Encryption DLL as in previous versionsCC CommunicationThe SSD backdoor sets up CC communication through an HTTP listener on the infected machine It is achieved using two classesServerManager is used to extract the sites hosted by the IIS server and build the HashSet of URL prefixes to listen onIn this specific case the only relative URI configured in the malware sample is TemporaryListenAddresses The malware then uses the HttpListener class to start listening on the specified URL prefixesCC command executionThe backdoor has several capabilities execute commands usingcmdexe upload and download files execute processes with specified arguments and run additional NET assembliesFirst if the POST request body contains data the malware parses it and handles the message as one of the 4 commands it supports Otherwise if the request contains a parameterVet the malware simply decodes its value from base64 and executes it withcmd c If none of these is true then the malware handles the heartbeat mechanism if the request URL contains the stringwOxhuoSBgpGcnLQZxipain lowercase then the malware sends backUsEPTIkCRUwarKZfRnyjcG13DFAalong with a200 OKresponseThe data from the POST request is encrypted using Base64 and simple XOR-based encryptionAfter decrypting the data of the message the malware parses it according to the following orderThe possible commands as named by the threat actors includeThe response data is built the same way as the request returns command type command name and output and then encrypted with the same XOR-based algorithm as the requestThe final payload is obfuscated with a commercial obfuscator in addition to already familiar class method and string obfuscations and it combines the functionality of the SDD backdoor and FOXSHELL proxy To achieve both it listens on two sets of URL prefixes using ServerManager and HTTPListener similarly to the SSD backdoorLIONTAIL framework components share similar obfuscation and string artifacts with FOXSHELL SDD backdoor and WINTAPIX drivers Currently we are not aware of any other threat actors utilizing these tools and we attribute them all to Scarred Manticore based on multiple code overlaps and shared victimologyFor the last few years Scarred Manticore has been observed carrying out multiple stealthy operations in Middle Eastern countries including gaining access to telecommunications and government organizations in the region and maintaining and leveraging this access for months to systematically exfiltrate data from the victims systems Examining the history of their activities it becomes evident how far the threat actor has come in improving their attacks and enhancing their approach which relies on passive implantsWhile LIONTAIL represents a logical progression in the evolution of FOXSHELL and still bears some distinctive characteristics that allow us to attribute attacks involving LIONTAIL to Scarred Manticore it stands out from other observed variants The LIONTAIL framework does not use common usually monitored methods for implementing listeners it no longer depends on Internet Information Services IIS its modules or any other options and libraries provided by the NET framework to manage IIS programmatically Instead it utilizes the lowest level of Windows HTTP Stack by interacting directly with the HTTPsys driver In addition it apparently allows the threat actors to customize the implants their configuration parameters and loaders file delivery type All those have enhanced the stealth ability of the implants enabling them to evade detection for an extended periodWe expect that Scarred Manticore operations will persist and may spread into other regions as per Iranian long-term interests While most of the recent activity of Scarred Manticore is primarily focused on maintaining covert access and data extraction the troubling example of the attack on the Albanian government networks serves as a reminder that nation-state actors may collaborate and share access with their counterparts in intelligence agenciesIPSBackdoorWIN32LiontailABThreat EmulationAPTWinsLiontailCDSubscribe for cpr blogs news and more 1994- Check Point Software Technologies LTD All rights

        "title": "Over the Kazuars Nest Cracking Down on a Freshly Hatched Backdoor Used by Pensive Ursa Aka Turla",
        "text": "October 31 2023 at 600 AMWhile tracking the evolution of Pensive Ursa aka Turla Uroburos Unit 42 researchers came across a new upgraded variant of Kazuar Not only is Kazuar another name for the enormous and dangerous cassowary bird Kazuar is an advanced and stealthy NET backdoor that Pensive Ursa usually uses as a second stage payloadAs the code of the upgraded revision of Kazuar reveals the authors put special emphasis on Kazuars ability to operate in stealth evade detection and thwart analysis efforts They do so using a variety of advanced anti-analysis techniques and by protecting the malware code with effective encryption and obfuscation practicesPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections from and mitigations for the threats mentioned in this article in the following waysKazuar is known for being an advanced and stealthy NET backdoor that Pensive Ursa usually uses as a second stage payload delivered together with other tools that the threat group commonly usesThis post will detail previously undocumented features includingSince at least 2018 variants of Kazuar changed their obfuscation methods and methodically modified its compilation timestamps Some variants used the ConfuserEx obfuscator to encrypt strings and others used a custom method In the Kazuar variant analyzed in this blog the authors went a step further implementing multiple custom methods for string encryptionUnlike with previous variants the authors only focused on targeting the Windows operating systemKazuar also contains hard-coded hashed identifiers for the Agent version and BuildID as well as an Agent label These can be used as variant identifiers as shown in Figure 1This check appears to be a simple form of an anti-analysis mechanism to ensure that the execution of the malware was done by the intended loader and not by other means or softwareKazuar will execute if its filename matches a specific hard-coded hashed name using the FNV algorithm This behavior is probably meant for debugging purposes letting the authors avoid using the loader each time they debug the malwareIt is also worth mentioning that there is a currently unreferenced option to create a file called wordlist in the code This file could give us a clue about a feature not yet implemented perhaps using a wordlist for directories filenames or password brute forcingThe malware creates a separate main configuration file that includes data including the followingKazuar is using a mutex to check its injection into another process Kazuar generates its mutex name by XORing the current process ID with the hard-coded value 0x4ac882d887106b7d and then XORing it with the machine's GUID as depicted in Figure 5 This means that several Kazuars can operate in tandem on the same device just not injected into the same processThe new version of Kazuar uses what it describes in the configuration as injection modes as shown in Table 1 The default mode is injectTable 1 Kazuar injection modes and descriptionsIn zombify mode Kazuar is injected into the users default browser and has a fallback mechanism to inject itself to svchostexe in case the query for the default browser fails Figure 6 shows that the term zombify addresses process injection in general by Kazuars authorsKazuar operates in a multithreading model while each of Kazuars main functionalities operates as its own thread In other words one thread handles receiving commands or tasks from its C2 while a solver thread handles execution of these commands This multithreading model enables Kazuars authors to establish an asynchronous and modular flow control Figure 7 shows the task solver flowKazuar receives new tasks solves them and writes the output into result files A solver thread is handling new tasks received from the C2 servers or another Kazuar node The task content is then encrypted and written to disk into a task fileEach task file implements a hybrid encryption schemeAs shown in Figure 8 once a task is complete the generated result file will be saved to diskIn addition to the aforementioned encrypted data Kazuar writes the following fields to the beginning of the result fileFigure 9 shows the encrypted result file content from diskKazuars code includes a high volume of strings that are related to functionality and debugging When revealed in plain text they shed light on the inner workings and functionality of Kazuar To avoid the scenario of researchers creating strings-based indicative YARA and hunting rules Kazuars strings are encrypted It decrypts each string at runtimeFigure 11 shows a loop iterating over a given string and checking if the ordinal value of a given character is in the dictionary keys of the relevant class If it is Kazuar swaps the key and value and appends it to the crafted string Otherwise it keeps the original characterIn addition to the string obfuscation the authors have given unmeaningful names to the classes and methods in the code to make analysis more difficultOne of the strings decoded by Kazuar returns the value Invalid pong responce as shown in Figure 12 It seems that one of the malware coders forgot to switch the Russian C for an English SKazuar supports 45 different tasks it can receive from its C2 as shown in Table 2 This is yet another development in Kazuars code as previous research hadnt documented some of these tasks By comparison Kazuars first variant analyzed back in 2017 supported only 26 C2 commandsWe have grouped Kazuars commands into the following categoriesTable 2 Kazuars supported C2 commandsKazuar has the capability to attempt to steal credentials from many artifacts in the infected computer by receiving the commands steal or unattend from the C2These artifacts include multiple well-known cloud applicationsBesides the two aforementioned text files as part of this task the malware takes a screenshot of the users screen Figure 15 shows the zipping of all of these files into one archive before being encrypted and sent to the C2Kazuar has the ability to set up automated tasks that will run at specified intervals to gather information from the infected machines Figure 16 shows an example of this functionality as documented in Kazuars configurationThese automated tasks include the followingKazuar has the ability to let attackers set up what they called peep rules in the configuration Although Kazuar does not come with these rules set out of the box according to the malwares code it appears that this functionality enables the attacker to monitor the windows of specified processes This allows the attacker to track user activity of interest on the compromised machinePrior to establishing a communication channel with a C2 server and in addition to the aforementioned anti-analysis checks Kazuar checks the configuration data-sending time intervals This check includes determining whether it should send data over the weekend or notUpon first communication Kazuar sends the collected data described in the Comprehensive System Profiling section in an XML format and expects to get an XML structured response back with a new task Figure 17 shows the HTTP requestKazuar uses a hard-coded value 169739e7-2112-9514-6a61-d300c0fef02d casted to a string and Base64 encoded as the cookieKazuar generates key names for the XML and Base64 encrypts the content prior to sending it to the C2 The content of the XML containsKazuar uses these pipes to establish peer-to-peer communication between different Kazuar instances configuring each as a server or a client The named pipe communication supports the remote requests shown in Table 3Table 3 Kazuar requests and responses using named pipesKazuar uses multiple anti-analysis techniques based on a series of elaborate checks to ensure it is not being analyzed The authors programmed Kazuar to either continue if the coast is clear or to remain idle and cease all C2 communication if it is being debugged or analyzed We can group these checks into three main categories honeypot analysis tools and sandboxKazuar checks if it has set the antidumpmethods setting to true then overrides the pointers to its custom methods while ignoring generic NET methods essentially wiping them from memory as Kazuars logged message states This ultimately prevents researchers from dumping an intact version of the malwareOne of the first things Kazuar specifically searches for is the existence of Kaspersky honeypot artifacts on the machine It uses a hard-coded list of specific process names and filenames to do thisIf Kazuar finds more than five of these files or processes it will log that it found a Kaspersky honeypot Figure 18 shows these filenamesKazuar has a list of hard-coded names of different popular analysis tools such as the followingKazuar collects and parses events from the Windows event logs Figure 19 shows Kazuar specifically looking for events from the following antivirussecurity vendorsSame as with checking for Kasperskys honeypot a plausible explanation would be that these security products are popular with their victimsWe examined the newest Kazuar malware variant that we detected in the wild Notable features include the followingAll the aforementioned features are designed to provide the Kazuar backdoor a high level of stealth Other noteworthy characteristics of this malware areThis version of Kazuar also supports an array of over 40 distinct commands half of which were previously undocumentedWe encourage security practitioners and defenders to study this report and use the information provided to enhance current detection prevention and hunting practices to overall strengthen their security postureExecution of native code by Kazuar for process injection and WMI execution triggered several alerts as well as other suspicious and uncharacteristic activity carried out by explorerexe We detailed the alerts including the alert shown in Figure 20 in Figure 21 belowFinally Figure 23 shows that when in prevent mode Cortex XDR prevents the Kazuar malware executable and triggers the alert pop-up accordinglyThe Cortex XDR platform detects and prevents the

        "title": "FastViewer Variant Merged with FastSpy and disguised as a Legitimate Mobile Application by S2W S2W BLOG Oct 2023 Medium",
        "text": "S2W BLOG--ListenShareAuthor Youngjae Shin Sebin Lee BLKSMTHLast Modified Oct 30 2023 The package name app name icon and some features are identical to the legitimate app FastSpy is based on AndroSpy an Android open-source written in XamarinIn the past the FastViewer malware only executed malicious behavior when a specially created document created by the attacker was loaded If the first 4 bytes of the file have the value EDC the malicious code is executed downloads the FastSpy malware from the CC server and dynamically loads itAt the time we traced and analyzed the CC server used by the FastViewer and FastSpy malware and confirmed the link between the malware and the Kimsuky group Recently through our threat hunting we further identified a variant of FastViewer with some changes in functionality and we would like to describe our analysisFastViewer impersonated a Korean Hangul Word Processor HWP file viewer program called Hancom Office last year but the latest iteration of FastViewer disguises itself as a legitimate app unrelated to file viewers Below is a list of the apps that FastViewer has impersonated so far In addition to this we have also seen FastViewer trying to disguise itself as a Google Authenticator anti-virus or payment service appThe FastViewer we analyzed last year downloaded an additional malicious app based on the open-source project AndroSpy called FastSpy to execute commands and in the case of the FastViewer we identified this time some of the features of FastSpy were mergedIn addition previously the FastViewer disguised as a viewer file was configured to execute the malicious behavior only when the first 4 bytes of the file EDC were loaded but the latest version does not seem to have adopted the above feature in that this feature is not called Also since they are no longer using FastSpy and have integrated some of its features into FastViewer it is assumed that they have removed the document triggering process since they are using a common app themeFrom the servers identified as being operated by the Kimsuky group we secured 21 APK files that appear to have been created by the attackers After categorizing the files a total of 6 package names were used and 5 themes were identified Based on the saved filenames it appears that they have been preparing for this campaign since at least July 8 2023The 1447610961 server operated by the attacker at the time was directory listed allowing us to see all of the files uploaded to it which further confirmed that the AsyncRAT malware was uploaded on the serverAfter analyzing the malicious apps we found that the latest version of FastViewer used the same package name app name and app icon as the legitimate app In the past the package name and app icon were partially different from the legitimate app but this time it was implemented the same as the legitimate app making it difficult to distinguish the malicious app from the appIn addition fields such as Target SDK and main activity information in the AndroidManifestxml were tampered with and permissions broadcast receivers and services were added for malicious behaviorFastViewer variant calls a service if a specific permission is granted or executed by a receiver at boot time When the malware is launched the added or tampered main activity checks if the battery optimization permission is granted to the app and if not it requests permission from the user If the battery optimization permission is granted the malicious behavior is performed by calling the malicious serviceIn addition when the device reboots or a boot-related event occurs after the app is installed the broadcast receiver added during the repackaging executes the malicious service When the malware is invoked by receiving a boot event it does not check for battery optimization permissions unlike the main activity case If the app has additional permissions to read SMS and access all files it will execute normal update-related activities2 Information theftThe main purpose of the FastViewer variant is to steal information from the infected device Once the malicious service is triggered by the aforementioned conditions the malicious code implemented inside is executed repeatedly at a set cycle Default value is 5 minutes It then sends the infected devices information in plain text prefixed with the string Kur- to identify the infected device This format of string is recognized by the same characteristics as FastViewer FastSpy and AndroSpy in the past After transmission it receives commands from the CC server and performs malicious actions corresponding to those commands3 Command and ControlThe FastViewer variant communicates with the CC server repeatedly for the time specified in the Interval value of the setting value as described above At this time it reads the settingtxt file stored for each infected device from the CC server which contains a list of configuration valuesFor command and control it refers to the above data to determine whether to perform malicious behavior Depending on the value of the received command it is determined whether to perform SMS stealing resetting the malicious behavior execution cycle file list stealing and file data stealingIn the case of file listdata stealing commands the value for the command must be set to 0 to be executed but the default settings are set to 1 and 2 respectively so it works only by updating the configuration value4 PermissionsThe permissions required by FastViewer variants to perform malicious behaviors are as follows The permissions requested from the user include READSMS to steal text messages POSTNOTIFICATIONS to generate notifications access to external storageall files to steal files or file data after communication and battery optimization mode to prevent the app from entering Doze Mode5 Association with Old FastViewerThe past FastViewer and FastSpy feature an XOR operation with a decryption key of 2 bytes in size to decrypt the encrypted string The variant of FastViewer also uses this feature which is the biggest similarity to the old one except for the Turkish language variable due to AndroSpyFurthermore the PDF decryption method the name of the class that performs the CC communication the endpoint when communicating with the CC the commands received from the CC and the command separators received are also the same as the old FastViewerPersistenceDiscoveryCollectionCommand and ControlExfiltration----S2W BLOGS2W is specializing in cybersecurity data analysis for
