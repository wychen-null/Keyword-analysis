        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather NOBELIUM is now tracked as Midnight Blizzard Microsoft security researchers have discovered a post-compromise capability were calling MagicWeb which is used by a threat actor we track as NOBELIUM to maintain persistent access to compromised environments NOBELIUM remains highly active executing multiple campaigns in parallel targeting government organizations non-governmental organizations NGOs intergovernmental organizations IGOs and think tanks across the US Europe and Central Asia The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center MSTIC assesses that MagicWeb was likely deployed during an ongoing compromise and was leveraged by NOBELIUM possibly to maintain access during strategic remediation steps that could preempt evictionNOBELIUM was able to deploy MagicWeb by first gaining access to highly privileged credentials and moving laterally to gain administrative privileges to an AD FS system This is not a supply chain attack The attacker had admin access to the AD FS system and replaced a legitimate DLL with their own malicious DLL causing malware to be loaded by AD FS instead of the legitimate binary The backdoor was discovered by Microsofts Detection and Response Team DART in coordination with MSTIC and Microsoft 365 Defender Research during an ongoing incident response investigation Microsoft is sharing this information with consent from the client At the time of this investigation MagicWeb appears to be highly targetedSecurity Assertion Markup Language SAML uses x509 certificates to establish trust relationships between identity providers and services and to sign and decrypt tokens These x509 certificates contain enhanced key usage EKU values that specify what applications the certificate should be used for For instance an EKU containing an Object Identifier OID value of 1361413112022 would allow for the use of a SmartCard logon Organizations can create custom OIDs to further narrow certificate usageMagicWebs authentication bypass comes from passing a non-standard Enhanced Key Usage OID that is hardcoded in the MagicWeb malware during an authentication request for a specified User Principal Name When this unique hard coded OID value is encountered MagicWeb will cause the authentication request to bypass all standard AD FS processes including checks for MFA and validate the users claims MagicWeb is manipulating the user authentication certificates used in SAML sign-ins not the signing certificates for a SAML claim used in attacks like Golden SAMLNOBELIUMs ability to deploy MagicWeb hinged on having access to highly privileged credentials that had administrative access to the AD FS servers giving them the ability to perform whatever malicious activities they wanted to on the systems they had access toMigration to Azure Active Directory Azure AD authentication is recommended to reduce the risk of on-premises compromises moving laterally to your authentication servers Customers can use the following references on migrationSurface unsigned DLLs in GAC using Microsoft 365 DefenderThis query surfaces unsigned DLLs in the GAC folder created within the last 60 days Enumerate non-Microsoft signed DLLs in the GAC using PowerShellBelow is an example script that could be used to enumerate non-Microsoft signed DLLs in the relevant GAC folder where serverstxt is a list of servers you wish to scan Because the legitimate MicrosoftIdentityServerDiagnosticsdll is catalog signed signing wont appear when viewing file properties but it will show in PowerShell querying and on load of the DLLMicrosoft Defender Antivirus provides detection for this threat under the following malware nameMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint customers may see the following alert as an indication of possible attackMicrosoft isnt sharing IOCs on this NOBELIUM activity at this time However NOBELIUM frequently customizes infrastructure and capabilities per campaign minimizing operational risk should their campaign specific attributes be discovered If MagicWeb is identified in your environment its unlikely to match any static IOCs from other targets such as a SHA-256 value Its recommended to use the hunting guidance provided above to investigate your environmentNOBELIUM has modified the legitimate MicrosoftIdentityServerDiagnosticsdll by adding malicious code to the TraceLog class from the MicrosoftIdentityServerDiagnostics namespacetypeThe header section of the TraceLog class from the legitimate MicrosoftIdentityServerDiagnosticsdll is shown belowMeanwhile the header section of the TraceLog class from NOBELIUMs backdooredversion of MicrosoftIdentityServerDiagnosticsdll is shown belowThe malicious static constructor gets executed once before the first instance of the TraceLog class is created Given that new instances of the TraceLog class is created in various locations in this DLL the execution of the malicious static constructor is guaranteed to occur as soon as the DLL is loaded for the first time which would be upon startup of the AD FS server after the malicious changes to MicrosoftIdentityServerServicehostexeconfig described aboveNOBELIUMs malicious static constructor contains a reference to the Initialize method from a class named AuthLogThe AuthLog class is a brand-new and malicious class thats been added to the DLL by NOBELIUMAs shown above the Initialize method references a class named RuntimeHelper yet another class added to the DLL by the actor The primary purpose of the RuntimeHelper class and its OverloadMethod method is to hook legitimate AD FS related methods at runtime By hooking the legitimate AD FS methods the backdoor is capable of intercepting calls to the legitimate methods to instead invoke its own custom methodsThe screenshot above shows the following legitimate AD FS methods being hooked by MagicWebMagicWebs BeginBuild method is used to hook the legitimate target method Build from MicrosoftIdentityServerIdentityModeldllThe BeginBuild method first calls the MagicWebs helper method ValidateX509ExtensionsIf the helper method ValidateX509Extensions returns true BeginBuild returns trueIf ValidateX509Extensions returns false or an exception is thrown by calling ValidateX509Extensions BeginBuild invokes and returns the value returned by the legitimate Build method from MicrosoftIdentityServerIdentityModeldllThis means that before the legitimate target methodBuild from the legitimate MicrosoftIdentityServerIdentityModeldll gets an opportunity to inspectbuild a certificate MagicWebs hook method first inspects the certificate and returns true if the helper method ValidateX509Extensions returns trueThis allows the attacker to subvert the normal certificate inspectionbuild process by introducing a custom certificate inspectionbuild method thats invoked before the legitimate Build method is invokedMagicWebs helper method ValidateX509Extensions is called by BeginBuild and other methodsValidateX509Extensions returns false if the X509 certificate passed to the method is null or the Microsoft Cryptographic API certificate context handlepointer isnt setNext the method enumerates the extensions in the X509 certificate passed to the method If an enumerated extension is of type X509EnhancedKeyUsageExtension the method iterates the OIDs of the extension calculating the MD5 hash of each OID using a custom hash computation helper method ComputeHash that leverages the NET MD5 classIf the MD5 hash value of the OID matches one of the two following hardcoded MD5 values the method returns true this methodology is used to check if one of the two OID values below are present in the extensionIf none of the OID values are present the method returns falseThis helper method returns true if the certificate passed to the method contains one of the two magic OID values listed aboveTo retrieve the clients X509 certificate this method first calls the legitimate GetClientCertificate method from MicrosoftIdentityServerWebHostdll Next the hook method calls the helper method ValidateX509Extensions to determine whether the client certificate contains one of the two magic OID values If the client certificate contains one of the two OID values the hook methodThis means that regardless of what the legitimate method GetClientCertificate from MicrosoftIdentityServerWebHostdll sets the mClientCertificateError field to if a client certificate contains one of the magic OID values the hook method overwrites or sets the mClientCertificateError field to 0By using this technique the hook method appears to be influencing the normal behavior of the application to treat or accept a non-valid client certificate as a valid certificateThe hook method first indirectly invokes the legitimate ProcessClaims method by invoking the ProcessClaims method of the AuthLog classOn line 198 in figure 16 the hook method calls MagicWebs helper method GetClaims passing in the processed identity object returned by invoking the legitimate ProcessClaims methodAs shown above the GetClaims method accepts an identity object as a parameter The method then initializes three variables named type type2 and type3 with values obtained from the RuntimeHelpers static fieldarray named typesThe types field contains the following valuesThe assemblyByName2 variable above contains an assembly object representing the legitimate assembly MicrosoftIdentityServerIdentityModeldll if not already loaded the RuntimeHelper class loads the assembly into the current application domain By calling the GetType method RunHelper initializes the member of the types fieldarray with NET types from the MicrosoftIdentityServerIdentityModeldll assemblyReturning to the GetClaims method and the initialization of type type2 and type3 the variables type type2 and type3 get initialized with the following type objects from MicrosoftIdentityServerIdentityModeldllNext the GetClaims method retrieves the Claims property of the MicrosoftIdentityModelClaimsIclaimsIdentity identity object It also retrieves the number of claims of type MicrosoftIdentityModelClaimsClaimCollection present in the Claims propertyGetClaims then enumerates the claims of type MicrosoftIdentityModelClaimsClaim retrieving the string containing each claim and the corresponding claim typeAs shown above the claim string and claim type string are then stored in a list named list This list of claims and their corresponding claim types is then returned to the caller of the GetClaims method BeginProcessClaimsReturning to the BeginProcessClaims method after retrieving the claims using the GetClaims method the hook method BeginProcessClaims searches the claims list for presence of a claim with claim type of httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferencesAs shown on line 198 above the claims of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences if any is stored in a list named list If claim of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences is present and its value is set to httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsmultipleauthn the hook method returns theIclaimsIdentity object returned by the legitimate target method ProcessClaims from MicrosoftIdentityServerServicedll on line 191 of the hook methodThis behavior ensures that if MFA is already satisfied then the hook method simply acts as a pass-through method and doesnt affect the normal behavior of the claim processing pipelineIf a claim of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences is not present or its value is not set to httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsmultipleauthn the hook method proceeds to perform additional checks on the unprocessed claims that is the claims contained in the unprocessed identity object identity passed to the hook method Once again the hook method obtains a list of claims by calling the GetClaims helper method As mentioned above instead of calling the GetClaims helper method with the processed identity object returned by invoking the legitimate ProcessClaims method stored in the result variable on line 191 the hook method calls the GetClaims helper method with the unprocessed identity object identity passed to the hook methodOn line 204 the hook method enumerates the value of each claim and uses the ComputeHash helper method to calculate the MD5 hash value of each claim value from the unprocessed identity object It then checks if the MD5 value of any of the claims equals the MD5 hash value 6E3466296D2F63DEREDACTED This hash value is the only element of a hardcoded hash list named oidMFAHashes that is this list can be expanded to include other hash values of interestIf none of the claims have a value with MD5 hash value of 6E3466296D2F63DEREDACTED on line 206 the method simply returns the processed identity object returned by the legitimate target method ProcessClaims from MicrosoftIdentityServerServicedll on line 191 of the hook method As previously discussed the hash value 6E3466296D2F63DEREDACTED corresponds to the OID value 13614131121886851812957973486925812250419REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDHence the hook method enumerates the claims and if a claim with value 13614131121886851812957973486925812250419REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED isnt present on the claim list the hook method simply acts as a pass-through method and doesnt affect the normal behavior of claim processing pipelineIf by this point in the execution cycle the hook method hasnt returned yet it means one of the claims contains the OID value 13614131121886851812957973486925812250419REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED otherwise according to the logic described in the paragraph above the hook method wouldve returnedProceeding with confirmation that one of the claims contains the OID value 13614131121886851812957973486925812250419REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED the hook method proceeds to the section that represents the main purpose of MagicWeb to perform claim injectionBefore describing the code responsible for the claim injection process its important to revisit whats already stored in the list and claims variablesclaims As mentioned above this variable is used to store a list of claim typevalue pairs extracted from the unprocessed identity objectWith this information in mind and the fact that one of the claims contains the OID value 13614131121886851812957973486925812250419REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED once again heres the first part of the claim injection codeAs shown above if list is empty that is the processed identity object contained no claim typevalue pairs of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences the hook method instead turns to claims containing the list of all claim typevalue pairs extracted from theunprocessedidentity object and searches for claim typevalue pairs of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences in the claims list If the claims list contains one or more claim typevalue pairs of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences the hook method uses the claim information to add an identical claim of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences to the processed identity object line 213 aboveUsing this method if after passing the identity object to the legitimate ProcessClaims method no claim of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences is returned by the legitimate method the hook method manually adds a fraudulentclaim of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences to the list of claims returned to the caller of the hooked legitimate method ProcessClaimsAs shown above to add the fraudulent claim to the list of claims the hook method calls a helper method named AddClaimLike the code in the helper method GetClaims AddClaims initializes two variables with the following type objectsOn line 235 AddClaims gets the constructor for type MicrosoftIdentityModelClaimsClaim and invokes the constructor passing in the claim type and value from the caller of AddClaim to instantiate a new Claim objectThe legitimate internal constructor from MicrosoftIdentityModelClaimsClaim retrieved and invoked by AddClaim invokes the internal constructor Claim overloaded method with the following method parametersAfter instantiating a new Claim object AddClaim uses the Add method from type MicrosoftIdentityModelClaimsClaimCollection to add the new claim to the identity object passed to AddClaim by its caller in this case the new claim is added to the identity object containing the list of claims returned by the call to the legitimate method ProcessClaimsRevisiting the claim injection code in the hook method BeginProcessClaims and recalling the fact that one of the claims contains the OID value 13614131121886851812957973486925812250419REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED heres the second part of the claim injection codeRecall that list contains claim typevalue pairs of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences extracted from the processed identity object If none of the claims in list have the value httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsmultipleauthn the hook method proceeds to call AddClaim to add a fraudulent claim of type httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsauthnmethodsreferences and value httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsmultipleauthn to the list of claims returned to the caller of the hooked legitimate method ProcessClaimsUsing the fraudulent claim injection techniques described above if a claim with the Magic OID value 13614131121886851812957973486925812250419REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED is presented to AD FS regardless of how the legitimate hooked method ProcessClaims handles the claim the BeginProcessClaims hook function ensures that a claim with value httpschemasmicrosoftcomclaimsmultipleauthn is returned to the caller of the legitimate hooked method ProcessClaimsThe backdoor BeginEndpointConfiguration method used to hook the legitimate target method EndpointConfiguration from MicrosoftIdentityServerWebHostdll is shown belowThe enumType variable is initialized with RuntimeHelpertypes0 which is a MicrosoftIdentityServerWebHostProxyCertificateValidation type object The PropertyInfo variables propertyInfo propertyInfo2 and propertyInfo3 are initialized with property objects retrieved from properties fieldarray of RuntimeHelperBehaving as a true hook method on line 179 the method calls the legitimate EndpointConfiguration method but with the modified value objectHence when the legitimate EndpointConfiguration method is invoked during the normal operation of AD FS this hook method intercepts the call and before passing the object to the legitimate EndpointConfiguration method was invoked with it overwrites theCertificateValidation value of each ProxyEndpoint object and only then it calls the legitimate EndpointConfiguration method but now with modifiedCertificateValidation values changed from SSL to NoneThe purpose of overwriting CertificationValidation value to None wherever its SSL is to allow WAP to pass the request with the specific malicious certificate to AD FS for further authentication processing According to MicrosoftIdentityServerProxyServiceTLSClientReqeustHandler WAP stops sending the current request from client to AD FS if CertificateValidation is 1 SSL and the client certificate has an error during validationAt the CYBERWARCON 2023 conference Microsoft and LinkedIn analysts are presenting several sessions detailing

        "text": "The North Korean 'Kimsuky' threat actors are going to great lengths to ensure that their malicious payloads are only downloaded by valid targets and not on the systems of security researchersAccording to a Kaspersky report published today the threat group has been employing new techniques to filter out invalid download requests since the start of 2022 when the group launched a new campaign against various targets in the Korean peninsulaThe new safeguards implemented by Kimsuky are so effective that Kaspersky reports an inability to acquire the final payloads even after they are successfully connected to the threat actors command and control serverThe attacks spotted by Kaspersky begin with a phishing email sent to politicians diplomats university professors and journalists in North and South KoreaKaspersky was able to compile a list of potential targets thanks to retrieved C2 scripts containing partial email addresses of targetsThe emails contain a link that takes victims to a first-stage C2 server that checks and verifies a few parameters before delivering a malicious document If the visitor doesnt match the list of targets they are served an innocuous documentThe parameters include the visitors email address OS Windows is valid and the file whotxt thats dropped by the second-stage serverAt the same time the visitors IP address is forwarded to the second-stage C2 server as a subsequent checking parameterThe document dropped by the first-stage C2 contains a malicious macro that connects the victim to the second-stage C2 fetches the next-stage payload and runs it with the mshtaexe processThe payload is an HTA file that also creates a scheduled task for auto-execution Its function is to profile the victim by checking ProgramFiles folder paths AV name username OS version MS Office version NET framework version and moreThe fingerprint result is stored in a string chnome a copy is sent to the C2 and a new payload is fetched and registered with a persistence mechanismThe next payload is a VBS file that can take the victim to a legitimate blog or if theyre valid targets take them to the next payload-download phaseThe authors intent here is to operate a dedicated fake blog for each victim thereby decreasing the exposure of their malware and infrastructureThis is when the victims system is checked for the existence of the unusual chnome string which was purposefully misspelled to serve as a unique validator that still doesnt raise suspicionsUnfortunately Kaspersky couldnt continue from here and fetch the next stage payload so whether that would be the final one or if there were most validation steps remains unknownThe campaign highlighted by Kaspersky illustrates the elaborate techniques employed by the Korean hackers to hinder analysis and make their tracking much harder"

MERCURY has used Log4j 2 exploits in the past such as on vulnerable VMware apps we have not seen this actor using SysAid apps as a vector for initial access until now After gaining access MERCURY establishes persistence dumps credentials and moves laterally within the targeted organization using both custom and well-known hacking tools as well as built-in operating system tools for its hands-on-keyboard attackThis blog details Microsofts analysis of observed MERCURY activity and related tools used in targeted attacks This information is shared with our customers and industry partners to improve detection of these attacks such as implementing detections against MERCURYs tools in both Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint As with any observed nation-state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised providing them with the information needed to secure their accountsMicrosoft assesses with moderate confidence that MERCURY exploited remote code execution vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j 2 also referred to as Log4Shell in vulnerable SysAid Server instances the targets were running MERCURY has used Log4j 2 exploits in past campaigns as wellThe following are common MERCURY techniques and toolingThis latest activity sheds light on behavior MERCURY isnt widely known for scanning and exploiting a vulnerable application on a targets device They have been observed performing this activity in the past but it is not very common The exploits are derived from open source and sculpted to fit their needsOn July 23 and 25 2022 MERCURY was observed using exploits against vulnerable SysAid Server instances as its initial access vector Based on observations from past campaigns and vulnerabilities found in target environments Microsoft assess that the exploits used were most likely related to Log4j 2 The threat actor leveraged Log4j 2 exploits against VMware applications earlier in 2022 and likely looked for similarly vulnerable internet-facing apps SysAid which provides IT management tools might have presented as an attractive target for its presence in the targeted countryExploiting SysAid successfully enables the threat actor to drop and leverage web shells to execute several commands as listed below Most commands are related to reconnaissance with one encoded PowerShell that downloads the actors tool for lateral movement and persistenceExecuted commandsOnce MERCURY has obtained access to the target organization the threat actor establishes persistence using several methods includingThe actor leverages the new local administrator user to connect through remote desktop protocol RDP During this session the threat actor dumps credentials by leveraging the open-source application Mimikatz We also observed MERCURY later performing additional credential dumping in SQL servers to steal other high privileged accounts like service accountsWe observed MERCURY further using its foothold to compromise other devices within the target organizations by leveraging several methods such asMost of the commands launched are meant to install tools on targets or perform reconnaissance to find domain administrator accountsThroughout the attack the threat actor used different methods to communicate with their command-and-control C2 server includingMicrosoft will continue to monitor MERCURY activity and implement protections for our customers The current detections advanced detections and IOCs in place across our security products are detailed belowThe techniques used by the actor and described in the Observed actor activity section can be mitigated by adopting the security considerations provided belowThe below list provides IOCs observed during our investigation We encourage our customers to investigate these indicators in their environments and implement detections and protections to identify past related activity and prevent future attacks against their systemsNOTE These indicators should not be considered exhaustive for this observed activityReducing the attack surfaceDetecting Log4j 2 exploitationDetecting post-exploitation

        "text": "The Donot Team threat actor has updated its Jaca Windows malware toolkit with improved capabilities including a revamped stealer module designed to plunder information from Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsersAlso known as APT-C-35 and Viceroy Tiger the Donot Team is known for setting its sights on defense diplomatic government and military entities in India Pakistan Sri Lanka and Bangladesh among others at least since 2016Spear-phishing campaigns containing malicious Microsoft Office documents are the preferred delivery pathway for malware followed by taking advantage of macros and other known vulnerabilities in the productivity software to launch the backdoorThis entails the use of RTF documents that trick users into enabling macros resulting in the execution of a piece of shellcode injected into memory that in turn is orchestrated to download a second-stage shellcode from its command-and-control C2 serverThe second-stage then acts as a channel to retrieve a DLL file pgixedfxglmjirdcdll from another remote server which kick-starts the actual infection by beaconing system information to the C2 server establishing persistence via a Scheduled Task and fetching the next-stage DLL WavemsMpdll The main purpose of this stage is to download and execute the modules used to steal the user's information the researchers noted To understand which modules are used in the current infection the malware communicates with another C2 serverThe C2 domain for its part is obtained by accessing an embedded link that points to a Google Drive document allowing the malware to access a configuration that dictates the modules to be downloaded and executedThese modules expand on the malware's features and harvest a wide range of data such as keystrokes screenshots files and information stored in web browsers Also part of the toolset is a reverse shell module that grants the actor remote access to the victim machineThe development is yet another sign that threat actors are actively adapting their tactics and techniques that are most effective in gaining initial infection and maintaining remote access for extended periods of timeDefending against APTs like the Donot team requires a Defense-in-Depth strategy that uses multiple layers of security to ensure redundancy if any given layers are breached the researchers saidDiscover how application detection response and automated behavior modeling can revolutionize your defense against insider threatsJoin the conversation to learn how to combat Zenbleed and Kubernetes attacksSign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news insights and tips"

with combinations of products and servicesMitigate threats reduce risk and get back to business with the help of leading expertsMandiant specializes in cyber threat intelligence offering products services and more to support our mission to defend against cyber crimeGet the latest insights from cyber security experts at the frontlines of threat intelligence and incident responseLearn more about us and our mission to help organizations defend against cyber crimeOver the last year Mandiant has been tracking UNC3890 a cluster of activity targeting Israeli shipping government energy and healthcare organizations via social engineering lures and a potential watering hole Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence this actor is linked to Iran which is notable given the strong focus on shipping and the ongoing naval conflict between Iran and Israel While we believe this actor is focused on intelligence collection the collected data may be leveraged to support various activities from hack-and-leak to enabling kinetic warfare attacks like those that have plagued the shipping industry in recent years Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that UNC3890 conducts espionage and intelligence collection activity to support multiple Iranian interests and operations Targeting patterns indicate a strong interest in Israeli entities and organizations of various sectors including government shipping energy and healthcare We observed several limited technical connections to Iran such as PDB strings and Farsi language artifactsThis campaign has been active since at least late 2020 and is still ongoing as of mid-2022 and though it is regional in nature targeted entities include global companiesUNC3890 uses at least two unique tools a backdoor which we named SUGARUSH and a browser credential stealer which exfiltrates stolen data via Gmail Yahoo and Yandex email services that weve named SUGARDUMP UNC3890 also uses multiple publicly available tools such as the METASPLOIT framework and NorthStar C2 In addition Mandiant discovered UNC3890 operates an inter-connected network of Command-and-Control C2 servers The C2 servers host domains and fake login pages spoofing legitimate services such as Office 365 social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook as well as fake job offers and fake commercials for AI-based robotic dolls We observed the C2 servers communicating with multiple targets as well as with a watering hole that we believe was targeting the Israeli shipping sector in particular entities that handle and ship sensitive componentsThis blog post details the activity of UNC3890 including their proprietary malware TTPs we have not previously seen deployed by Iran and the publicly available tools we identified in our investigation Mandiant continues to track UNC3890 as well as other potentially related clusters of activity by the same threat actorIn late 2021 Mandiant identified UNC3890 targeting Israeli entities and showing interest in various sectors including government shipping energy aviation and healthcare Even though the targeting we observed is focused to Israel some of the entities targeted by UNC3890 especially in the shipping sector are global companies Therefore the potential impact of UNC3890 activity described in this blog may extend beyond Israel The activity is consistent with historical Iranian interest in these targets Targeting patterns and lures used by UNC3890 indicate an attempt to disguise their activity as legitimate login activity legitimate services and social network applications and technology-related visual contentMandiant observed UNC3890 deploy the following malware familiesMalware FamilyDescriptionSUGARUSHSUGARUSH is a backdoor written to establish a connection with an

shipping energy aviation and healthcare sectors While we are not aware of targeting outside Israel it is possible such targeting has occurred or will occur UNC3890 utilization of legitimate or publicly available tools in addition to their unique exfiltration method using Gmail Yahoo and Yandex email addresses may reflect their efforts to evade detection and to bypass heuristics or network-based security measuresWhile Mandiant primarily identified post-exploitation implants utilized by UNC3890 there are some findings that shed light about their initial access methodologies Mandiant identified UNC3890 potentially used the following initial access vectorsThe URL structure of the POST request hxxpsxn--lirkedin-vkbcomobjectphpbrowseruserbrowseripuseripWhen we inspected the watering hole it was already inactive but it was most likely used to target clients and users of that Israeli shipping company in particular ones shipping or handling heat-sensitive cargo based on the nature of the compromised website We have an additional indication of an attempted targeting of another major Israeli shipping company by UNC3890 which is consistent with the watering holeIt should be noted that many of these domains were hosted on the same infrastructure used by UNC3890 but date back to late 2020 which is before we can corroborate UNC3890 has been activeUNC3890 DomainLegitimate

data analytics solution After gaining initial access UNC3890 utilizes a broad toolset to access and control the victims environment In this sector we will focus on the analysis of two of UNC3890s proprietary tools we identified in our investigation the SUGARUSH backdoor and the SUGARDUMP credential harvesting tool We will also provide a brief analysis of the public tools utilized by UNC3890Most of the tools were available for download directly from UNC3890 controlled infrastructure indicating they may have been served as 1st stage implants Alternatively they may have been used as 2nd stages or later but UNC3890 may have misconfigured their infrastructure making it publicly accessibleSUGARUSH Analysis A Small But Efficient BackdoorSUGARUSH is a small custom backdoor that establishes a reverse shell over TCP to a hardcoded CC address Upon first execution SUGARUSH will create a new service called Service1 Subsequently SUGARUSH creates a logging folder called Logs and stores it under its current execution path A new folder namedServiceLog is created in the Logs folder and a new log file is written with the message Service is started at currentdate The name of the log files is the current date of the infected machineSUGARUSH will then check for internet connectivity of the host and will create a log file indicating the result with message You are online at currentdate or You are offline at currentdate If the attempt for internet connection is successful SUGARUSH will establish a new TCP connection to an embedded CC address via port 4585SUGARUSH then waits to receive an answer from the C2 which will be interpreted as a CMD command for executionSUGARUSH SamplesSUGARDUMP Analysis A Browser Credential Harvesting ToolSUGARDUMP is a small custom utility used for harvesting credentials from Chrome Opera and Edge Chromium browsersWhen executed SUGARDUMP will access the following pathsOut of each path SUGARDUMP will attempt collect specific foldersAfterwards SUGARDUMP will extract all of the available usernames and passwords from these foldersThe collected information is subsequently stored in the following formatWe observed several versions of SUGARDUMPSUGARDUMP first known version dated to early 2021 we observed two variants of this version the first one saves the stolen credentials under in a txt file under the path CUsersUserDesktoptest2txt The second variant prints the stolen credentials as a CMD outputWe observed two PDB paths contained in SUGARDUMP samplesSUGARDUMP using SMTP for C2 communication dated to late 2021-early 2022 This variant was downloaded from a known UNC3890 C2 URL hxxp12819962463-Video-VLCexe and is a slightly more advanced version with similar credential harvesting functionality The downloaded file 3-Video-VLCexe MD5 ae0a16b6feddd53d1d52ff50d85a42d5 is a Windows installer which upon execution drops and executes two files under the path AppDataRoamingUpon first execution CrashReporterexe SUGARDUMP attempts to locate the folder AppDataMicrosoftEdgeUser DataCrashPadIf it wasnt found it will search for folder AppDataMicrosoftInternet ExplorerTabRoamingIf the latter folder is not found as well the malware proceeds to create it The malware will then copy itself into TabRoaming folder again under the name CrashReporterexe Subsequently a scheduled task is created which ensures the persistence of this version of SUGARDUMPThe scheduled task is configured to execute CrashReporterexe during user logonThe malware then attempts to connect to smtpyandexcom and smtpmailyahoocom via port 587 If the attempt is successful the malware starts to harvest bowser related information on the hostThis version of SUGARDUMP harvest credentials from the following browsersFor each browser the malware attempts to extract login credentials from the following pathsThis version of SUGARDUMP also extracts the browsers version browsing history bookmarks and cookiesThe extracted data structure looks as followsThe collected data is subsequently encoded using base64 and stored under malwareexecutionfolderCrashLogtxtThe malware will then send the file CrashLogtxt via email by connecting and sending it from one of the two following email addressesThe email is sent to one of these four email addressesThe subject for each message would be VLC Player with CrashLogtxt attachedIf SUGARDUMP fails to send the message it creates a new file under malwarecurrentexecutionpathCrashLogNametxt and writes to the file the error details CrashLogNametxt is also sent via email using the same method mentioned above Afterwards the malware terminates its executionSUGARDUMP using HTTP for C2 communication dated to April 2022 this version sends the stolen credentials to an UNC3890 C2 server 14420212324880 We observed this version dropped by a xls file which contains a fake job offer to a software developer position in NexisLexis a data analytics platform MD5 639f83fa4265ddbb43e85b763fe3dbacThe xls file contains a Macro which upon enablement attempts to execute an embedded PE file using RunDLL MD5 e125ed072fc4529687d98cf4c62e283e The PE file is the newest version of SUGARDUMP we observed so farLike previous versions this version of SUGARDUMP harvests credentials from Chromium-based browsers Chrome Opera and Edge The data is saved in a new file under TEMPDebugLogWindowsDefendertxtThe collected data is subsequently encrypted using AES encryption using Cipher Block Chaining CBC mode The encryption key is the Sha256 of an embedded password 1qazXSW3edc123456be name KHODA 110 1qazXSW3edc The word KHODA means god in FarsiAfter the encryption process the data is also encoded using Base64 and subsequently sent over HTTP to an UNC3890 C2 server 14420212324880The NET project for this version of SUGARDUMP was named yaal which is the Farsi word for a horses mane This along with the use of the word KHODA in SUGARDUMPs encryption key may

        "text": "That increase has given experts at insurance firms unique insight into cybersecurity trends and the vulnerabilities that are plaguing businesses the most they get a behind-the-scenes look at attacks whenever a customer files a claimTommy Johnson is a cybersecurity engineer at cyber insurance firm Coalition a firm with about 160000 customers and backing from insurance giants like Allianz Lloyd's of London Swiss Re and moreIsabelle Dumont is a vice president at cyber insurance provider Cowbell Cyber a newer firm focused on serving small and medium-sized businesses Both chatted recently with The Record to share their key takeaways from recent cyber insurance data as the industry continues to expandRemote Desktop Protocol RDP attacks continue to be a prevalent tool for hackers and have led to a substantial amount of claims for insurers Technology gets deployed to improve the business without any security consideration Dumont said including RDPThroughout 2020 Coalition identified a large number of claims arising from threat actors who were able to compromise RDP which allows remote access to workplace resourcesThreat groups quickly exploited the vulnerabilities with Coalition seeing a 123 increase in claims frequency related to the exploitation of RDP and significant losses among businesses big and smallDue to the ephemeral nature of the RDP it can be difficult to manage the risk from an insurance and scanning standpoint We have seen companies open RDP intermittently to haphazardly administer machines and threat actors take advantage We continue to send the message that exposing RDP comes with critical risks but sometimes these warnings fall on deaf ears Johnson saidCase in point this March Coalition saw a claim where a company used RDP for its call center in Southeast Asia which threat actors exploited in order to deploy ransomwareRansomware continues to have a dramatic effect on cyber insurance claims according to Dumont and Johnson driving costs upwards for companiesJohnson said the average ransom demand made against their policyholders increased by one-fifth in the latter half of 2021 while the number of claims increased 10Coalition did not find that any industries in particular stand out as targets of ransomware groups Rather Johnson said threat actors are interested in exploiting insecure technologies organizations use regardless of sector or the employees themselvesWith ransomware cybercriminals are no longer focused only on stealing data that can be sold on the dark web Ransomware attacks give them a means to target any business sector to receive a ransom payment Dumont saidThe key difference is one company was able to restore from offline backups and the other had to pay the full ransom he said The difference between the two claims is a stark 460000 a substantial sum of moneyWhile ransomware and business email compromise garner a lot of attention Coalition found that phishing remains the primary attack vector for nearly half of all claimsThe number of attacks that resulted from exploit of internet-facing applications or the supply chain dropped Johnson explained Yet even so certain vulnerabilities remained an issue and dominated the dataMicrosoft Exchange especially remains an avenue for exploitationMicrosoft Exchange has proven to be a long-tail threat because Exchange is more than email it's tightly coupled with calendar functions and that's critical for many organizations Johnson saidThe initial vulnerability we detected with Exchange impacted roughly 1000 policyholders Johnson said Within a week of the March 2021 disclosure our team at Coalition notified and remediated the vulnerability for 98 of our affected policyholders However additional Exchange vulnerabilities continue to surfaceThe problem was so severe that Coalition developed a scanning engine that can determine which version of Exchange is running in a system the exact patch level and which outstanding vulnerabilities remainThe company now notifies policyholders in real-time when there is a new patchThis attack has been devastating to organizations unprepared for it because companies that employ VMware Horizon expose it on the internet to allow their distributed workforce to connect to their work machines he addedFor 2022 Coalitions claims data suggests that small- and medium-sized businesses suffer ransomware events far more frequently than larger accounts The second half of 2021 saw a 40 increase in ransomware attacks on organizations under 25 million in revenue compared to the start of the year and a 54 spike in incidents related to the compromise of business emailThis February and March all but one of Coalitions reported ransomware claims came from their small- and medium-sized enterprise programData shows that the groups behind ransomware attacks have no qualms about attacking any sectorCyber criminals are opportunistic particularly when it comes to small and midsize organizations and the technology and processes that organizations use are far more key to their risk than what their industry is Johnson said No company is too small to be an enticing financial opportunity for attackersStill Johnson said some industries have experienced notable increases in claims in the past year There was a 40 increase in claims severity in the second half of 2021 compared to the first for consumer staples businesses and nearly a one-quarter spike in claims severity for energy-related firmsHe added that small businesses typically lack dedicated IT or security staff leaving patch management in limbo and incident response plans unfinishedDumont noted that in recent months more companies have begun to take a business-like approach to cybersecurity due to processes mandated during the insurance processRisk assessments are now required by many cyber insurance providers Dumont said part of what helps lessen the severity of attacks for some companies is preparation using resources provided by insurance firmsIt is important to keep in mind that immunity against cyber attacks does not exist she said 100 of businesses regardless of size and industry can be faced with a cyber incidentJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014 Before moving back to New

warfare is conducted on the battlefield and limited by several factors cyber warfare continues in cyber space offering the chance to infiltrate and damage targets far behind the frontlinesRussia utilized cyberattacks during the initial phase of the invasion in February Reports from Trustwave and other security researchers show that Russian cyberattackers have maintained pressure launching a series of attacks showing how malware has been used against organizations in Ukraine either to destroy or gain control over targeted systemsIn this article we will summarize some of the most prominent Russian threat actors involved and the malware tools used in cyberattacks against UkraineDespite the high level and technical sophistication of the cyberattacks and the Russian Special Services

below illustrates the pressure placed on Ukrainian organizations and that government infrastructure is the attackers primary target of the attackers The variety of malware used and involvement of Russian state-sponsored threat actors makes it evident that successful protection measures against attackers would require not only reactive but also a proactive approachLooking at the type of malware

vectors used to deploy malware Spearphishing with malicious attachments or links are used to deliver CobaltStrike and GraphSteel backdoors or exploitation of vulnerabilities in public facing applications such as the VPN appliances compromised in the Viasat cyberattack are some of the most common intrusion methods used While the initial attack vector of HermeticWiper HermeticRansom and CaddyWiper are not entirely known at least one security vendor reported that the attackers appear to have exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server CVE-2021-1636Figure 4 - Initial Attack VectorsIt's interesting to note that the compilation timestamp of the HermeticWiper malware was December 28 2021 This suggests that the February attacks were in preparation since at least that timeAPT

constraints of conventional warfare offering the chance to infiltrate and damage targets far behind the frontlinesFinally compared to traditional warfare cyberwarfare is invisible to the naked eye does not risk lives on the side of the aggressor and is cost effectiveWith Ukraine being targeted by a variety of cyberattacks we can see that even legitimate penetration testing tools can behijacked

societies and will always be a lucrative target for attackers seeking monetary gain political or military advantage Understanding what digital technologies and tools are used in a conflict can help identify and mitigate future threats before the damage happensUnfortunately people are usually the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain as opening malicious attachments or links often leads to a compromise Effective prevention strategy should include training programs ensuring that personnel can identify and mitigate threats coupled with use of secure email gateways such as Trustwave

        "text": "Drones have played an outsized role in Ukraines efforts to locate troops and plan out attacks in its war with Russia But the devices are increasingly thwarted by an invisible enemy Russias electronic warfare arsenalElectronic warfare systems have been used by both Russia and Ukraine in recent months to locate disrupt and jam electronic and GPS signals from weapons and drones The systems can be used by aircraft naval ships ground forces and helicopters according to Samuel Bendett an analyst and expert in unmanned and robotic military systems at the Center for Naval AnalysesElectronic warfare systems use signals such as radar radio and infrared transmissions to detect interpret and disrupt communication The stations detect enemy electronic signals and attack the equipment emitting them essentially with white noise which makes them inoperableAlthough both countries have made use of the technology Russia in particular has invested in a wide range of equipment from tactical close-range systems to ones that can supposedly disrupt enemies dozens of kilometers away Bendett said And Russia has increasingly made use of these systems as cyberattacks and ground strikes against Ukraines communications infrastructure have proved to have limited impactWhen they realized that wasn't enough they turned to electronic warfare said Makena Young associate fellow with the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies CSISElectronic warfare technology isnt particularly new Even before the war Russia actively promoted its electronic warfare systems according to Valentyn Badrak director at Ukrainian Center for Army Conversion and Disarmament Studies It used some of the same systems in previous conflicts including the invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014 and the Syrian civil war in 2015But the systems have seen particularly heavy use in recent months as Russia looks to disrupt Ukraines drone strategyUkrainian charities have raised millions of dollars to purchase and develop unmanned aerial vehicles and the country has launched piloting schools including Dronarium and Boryviter to train hundreds of professional drone operatorsMore than 400 pilots graduated from these two schools in July according to the Ukrainian Digital Transformation MinistryUkraine has no centralized supply of drones for the army some soldiers buy drones themselves and others receive them from friends family or charitable funds Small commercial drones such as DJI quadcopters are not designed for war and make easy targets for sophisticated electronic warfare attacks according to BendettIn addition to small commercial drones used for surveillance Ukraines drone fleet has combat UAVs like the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and R18 developed by the Ukrainian drone unit AerorozvidkaBut drone operators have found it difficult to keep these devices in the airThere are entire segments of the front where Ukrainian drone operators cant fly their drones since they are getting jammed by the Russian EW forces Bendett saidThe Russian military is currently deploying Krasukha-2 and 4 R-330 Zhitel Moskva-1 Leer-3 RP-377LLA Lorandit and Pole systems among others according to Bendett They primarily target mobile networks satellite navigation and communication between drones and their operators he saidElectronic warfare systems have already had a major impact Ukrainian drone operators told The Record Russia has claimed to have destroyed at least 1700 Ukrainian drones since the start of the war although Ukraine hasn't confirmed this figureTo say how many drones we lost we need to know how many of them we had at the beginning of the war said Vadym the head of the robotics department at Aerorozvidka who asked to go by his first name due to security reasonsAlthough Russia has many strengths with electronic warfare Ukraine is trying to catch up according to BadrakThe Ukrainian electronic warfare arsenal is similar to Russias both countries inherited much of the technology from the USSR and developed systems together prior to the war In Ukraine the systems are developed by two private companies Ukrspetszvyazok and Proximus Among the most popular uniquely Ukrainian electronic warfare systems according to Badrak are Enclave Bukovel and Prometheus-MF5In addition to disrupting drones electronic warfare has been used to block communications in UkraineBecause of this most of the Ukrainian military uses the US L3Harris systems which are more secure according to Badrak Ukrainians also use Elon Musks satellite internet Starlink which is not as affected by Russian electronic warfare systems The Russians can locate Starlink terminals but deciphering the internet stream is very difficult so we recommend using them according to Vadym from AerorozvidkaAlthough some alternative communication channels exist there isnt always a way for Ukrainians to protect themselves from Russian electronic warfare systems according to Bendett Improving defense involves masking protecting and limiting electronic signatures including radio and cellular communications and electronic signals emitted by combat vehicles and systems he saidAccording to Young the best way to protect yourself from EW is to make sure your equipment is less vulnerable to these systems and that all of your communications are secureMost drone manufacturers have taken notice and will look for ways to avoid the impact of EW according to Vadym There is a solution to any problem but it takes time he saidFor now the conflict is revealing what war will look like in the future according to YoungSpace and cyber capabilities have been used during this war in ways we have never seen before It's a quick and easy way to disrupt someone's communication she told The RecordDaryna Antoniukis a freelance reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine She writes about cybersecurity startups cyberattacks in Eastern Europe and the state

defense sector When the RTF document is opened it tries to fetch a malicious remote template from its C2 by sending an HTTP GET request in the form domainXYphp If the User-Agent for that request doesnt contain MSOffice which is case sensitive and added by default in Office applications the C2 returns a decoy document with empty content Otherwise it downloads and injects a macro weaponized document This technique may trick a security solution that tries to scan the URL without the MSOffice User-Agent header and mark it as clear The remote template URLs are active for a limited period of time which makes analysis difficultWhen a remote template is injected it lures the victim to enable editing and content to allow the malicious macros to execute Once macros are enabled the Documentopen routine executes and starts with a for loop to delay the malicious code execution and then calls to the appropriate function based on the Winwordexe bitnessDocumentopen routine codeThe function injects a shellcode 32-bit64-bit into the process memory and invokes it The shellcode is injected using the following three WinAPI functionsWinAPI calls used for the shellcode executionBefore the execution of the payload the shellcode decrypts itself using a simple decryption routinenot followed by xor with a two-byte key which changes between stages After the shellcode is invoked it

HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftOffice120WordResiliThese configurations include XOR keys used in the second-stage shellcode and expiry dates for security products such as McAfee Norton and Bitdefender Some strings appear to be the attacker's local paths and debugging flagsNext the shellcode checks for security solutions by validating the existence of their drivers sys located under CWindowsSystem32drivers If security solutions are present the shellcode compares the current date to an expiry date configured in the shellcode builder and operates accordinglyFor instance in the researched sample 1 - 7 denote the following values1 hxxpmaklogupdatesxyzDWqYVVzQLc0xrqvtHG5HlDPqsnr3HBwOKY0vKGRBE7V0sDPdZb09n7xhp0klyT5Xmp32

sc DAILY st 1100 ri 10 du 24007 cmdexe tmpsyswow64dllThe malware will execute values depending on whether it finds a security solution For example the following table demonstrates the operation performed based on the driver found and the comparison between the current date and expiry dateSecurity solutions and corresponding actions according to the expiry dateIf none of the drivers are found on the victims machine the shellcode executes the default routine which downloads from 1 and modifies the three first bytes back to their original form This technique is used to evade security solutions and keep them from scanning the executable It then executes the exported function 5Morphisec Labs hasnt found a clear motive for the included expiry date and driver check When malware checks for security solutions in conjunction with a certain date its often because the authors tested their bypass against the latest version Future updates would react differently as theyre not tested Another common malware behavior after finding security solutions is to evade or abort execution In this case the malware slightly modifies its behavior but mostly continues its malicious activityThe initial infection executes the main DLL This DLL is responsible for beaconing back to the C2 server that the infection was successful and downloading the next component in the framework The following figure outlines the high-level relationships between the components in the rest of the executionComponent relationships with newupdated components highlightedDelivered by the shellcode the main DLL usually contains two exported functions In our case Qoltyfotskelo referred to as the first exported function and Yolueorgw referred to as the second exported functionThe first exported function is responsible for installing persistence and checking for security solutions Persistence is achieved by setting a new Scheduled Task via COM objects that runs every three minutes The action assigned to the task is to run the second exported functionYolueorgwThe second exported function is responsible for beaconing back to the C2 server Before it does so it creates a mutex to avoid multiple instances running at the same time and performs VM detection using WMI queriesLooking for VMware VMware Virtual Platform and VirtualBox in csproduct nameThe malware then uses Windows Management Instrumentation WMI to collect basic system information such as the name operating system caption build number and processor IDBeaconing information sent to the server before encryptionTo that information it concatenates the victims ID and the folder names under CProgram Files and CProgram Files x86 to learn which software is installed on the system What we refer to as victim ID is a concatenation of Username-ComputerName-ProcessorId This string identifies the victim in later communication with the C2 serverOnce this is done the malware can encrypt the victims data and beacon back to its C2 server The malware and server encryption is AES-256 with two sets of embedded keys and IVs The encrypted data is then encoded using Base64The beaconing process is divided into two steps shown belowBeaconing messages for downloading the next componentThe first message to the server is sent as a POST request to the first URL path firstpath embedded in the binary The body contains the following encrypted informationName CPU NameCaption OS VersionBuild Build Number VUsername-ComputerName-ProcessorIdO3Folder 1 NameFolder 2 NameDepending on the servers response the malware will either stay idle and keep the beaconing loop or download the next stage If the latter the malware sends another POST request to a second URL path secondpath on the same server This message contains the following encrypted information Username-ComputerName-ProcessorIdNext stage DLL nameThe response to that request is the next stage DLL To execute the next stage the malware creates another scheduled task and removes the previous one using a clean-up bat file see msbat in the Appendix sectionThe main purpose of this stage is to download and execute the modules used to steal the users information To understand which modules are used in the current infection the malware communicates with another C2 server The malware fetches the new address from an embedded link that refers to a Google Drive document containing the encrypted addressDownload the encrypted C2 server address from Google DriveThe decryption of the C2 address downloaded from Google DriveThis architecture allows the authors to frequently update their C2 servers without needing to redeliver the binary After the C2 server address is decrypted the malware sends a POST request to it with the encrypted victims ID in the request body The response is the modules configurationThis frameworks modularity stands out The configuration controls which modules to download and execute without needing to update the binary Morphisec Labs witnessed how this functionality came into play when a single binary communicated with different C2 servers and downloaded different modules across multiple runs over timeThe response specifies information about the modules delimited by pipeline where each part has the following formatModule nameModule sizeShould downloadExport name to executeAdditional parametersAdditionally there are special characters the malware looks for such asThe following figure illustrates the various modules and the interactions between themWhile Morphisec Labs was researching the previously known modules one module caught our attentionthe browser stealer The browser stealer was first introduced to the framework in late 2020 and since then we havent seen any significant changes Until nowInstead of implementing the stealing functionality inside the DLL the module uses four additional executables downloaded by the previous stage WavemsMpdll Each additional executable steals information from Google Chrome andor Mozilla Firefox The following table summarizes what data is stolen from each browserWinBroGogleexeGoogle Chrome credentialsCProgramDataucredgogleqrtybaseusagoglysernmWinBroGoMoHexeGoogle Chrome and Mozilla

it in a temporary plain text file The file is then encrypted and saved as a rnm file which is later sent back to the C2 server by the file upload module ieflagUldllSo far the reverse shell module has been implemented as an executable file But now the actor aligns with the rest of the modules and recompiles the reverse shell as a DLL The functionality remains the same opening a socket to the attackers machine located at 1623317741 creating a new hidden cmdexe process and setting the STDIN STDOUT and STDERR as the socketThe shell runs until the actor sends the string exitnDefending against APTs like the DoNot team requires a Defense-in-Depth strategy that uses multiple layers of security to ensure redundancy if any given layers are breached Any sufficiently large organization is at risk of being attacked by an APT group such as the DoNot team And these groups target a crucial security gap that few organizations have plugged This gap exists between attack surface reduction strategiessuch as patching security updates hardening networks firewalls and web applications firewalls and technologies such as data security tools NGAV EDR EPP and XDR etc which focus on detecting anomalies on the disc or in the operating system That gap is the runtime environment in memoryThe hardest attacks to defend against are those thatlike the Windows framework detailed heretarget applications at runtime This is because popular security solutions such as NGAV EDR EPP XDR etc focus on detecting anomalies on the disc or operating system Their ability to detect or block attacks in memory at runtime is limited To the extent they can do so they cause major system performance issues and false alerts because they must be dialed to their most aggressive alert settingsecho

        "text": "Team82 ResearchThe attack targets engineers working every day on industrial networks configuring and troubleshooting PLCs to ensure the safety and reliability of processes across critical industries such as utilities electricity water and wastewater heavy industry manufacturing and automotive among othersThis paper will describe in depth not only how engineers diagnose PLC issues write and transfer bytecode to PLCs for execution but also how Team82 conceptualized developed and implemented numerous novel techniques to successfully use a PLC to achieve code execution on the engineers machineThe full report includes a list of affected vendors and products as well as links to their respective advisories and remediations or mitigationsProgrammable logic controllers PLCs have for more than a decade been the focus of advanced attacks From Stuxnet to the recently uncovered IncontrollerPipedream platform threat actors try to reach and control PLCs in order to modify the processes they oversee cause disruption physical damage and threaten personal safetyBut what if an attacker was able to flip that scenario on its head and turn the PLC into the predator rather than the prey What if there was a way to weaponize PLCs in order to exploit engineering workstations the powerful platforms used to configure and maintain PLCs These workstation applications are often a bridge between operational technology networks and corporate networks An attacker who is able to compromise and exploit vulnerabilities in an engineering workstation could easily move onto the internal network move laterally between systems and gain further access to other PLCs and sensitive systemsTeam82 today has released a research paper that describes just such a novel attack which it has named the Evil PLC AttackThe attack targets engineers working every day on industrial networks configuring and troubleshooting PLCs to ensure the safety and reliability of processes across critical industries such as utilities electricity water and wastewater heavy industry manufacturing and automotive among othersOT networks may have dozens of PLCs overseeing industrial processes an attacker wishing to physically disrupt a process would need to first perform an extensive enumeration of those controllers in order to find the right one to targetThe Evil PLC Attack turns the PLCs into the tool rather than the target By weaponizing one PLC an attacker may in turn compromise the engineers workstation which is the best source for process-related information and would have access to all the other PLCs on the network With this access and information the attacker can easily alter the logic on any PLCThe trick would be to lure an engineer to connect to a compromised PLC the quickest way is to cause a fault on the PLC That is a typical scenario an engineer would respond to and connect using their engineering workstation application as a troubleshooting toolThis was Team82s approach as we decided to research this novel attack vector by finding vulnerabilities in each of the seven engineering workstation platforms that allowed us to weaponize the PLC in a way that when an upload procedure is performedupload procedures involve the transfer of metadata configurations and textcode from the PLC to the engineering workstationour specifically crafted auxiliary pieces of data would cause the engineering workstation to execute our malicious codeThis technique weaponizes the PLC with data that isn't necessarily part of a normal staticoffline project file and enables code execution upon an engineering connectionupload procedure Through this attack vector the goal is not the PLC such as it was for example with the notorious Stuxnet malware that stealthily changed PLC logic to cause physical damage Instead we want to use the PLC as a pivot point to attack the engineers who program and diagnose it and gain deeper access to the OT networkIts important to note that all the vulnerabilities we found were on the engineering workstation software side and not in the PLC firmware In most cases the vulnerabilities exist because the software fully trusted data coming from the PLC without performing extensive security checksTeam82 devices three distinct attack scenarios for the Evil PLC AttackWeaponizing PLCs to Achieve Initial Access Attackers could use weaponized PLCs in order to gain an initial foothold on internal networks or even for lateral movementAttacking Traveling Integrators Attackers could target system integrators and contractors as a means of entry to many different organizations and sites around the worldWeaponizing PLCs as a Honeypot Defenders could use honeypot PLCs to attract and attack possible attackers thus deterring and frustrating would-be attackersPLCs that are exposed to the internet generally lack security such as authentication and authorization and are revealed through a Shodan and Censys search An attacker able to access a PLC in this way is able to modify parameters or their behavior and logic through malicious download proceduresOpportunistic attackers identify internet-facing PLCs connect to them using commercial engineering workstation software and upload the current project which includes code and settings from the PLC Then the attackers will modify the logic of the project and perform a download procedure to change the PLC logic with their modifications One example of such an incident was the 2020 attack on Israels water supply where attackers exploited accessible PLCs and attempted to flood the water supply with chlorineOur research suggests that attackers could use the internet-facing PLCs as a pivot point to infiltrate the entire OT network Instead of simply connecting to the exposed PLCs and modifying the logic attackers could arm these PLCs and deliberately cause a fault that will lure an engineer to them The engineer as a method of diagnostics will perform an upload procedure that will compromise their machine The attackers now have their foothold on the OT networkModern OT management often involves third-party engineers and contractors interacting with many different networks and PLCs In this attack scenario the system integrator is the pivot point between the PLC and engineering workstation that has oversight of numerous OT networksThe attack would look like this An attacker would locate a PLC in a remote less secure facility that is known to be managed by a system integrator or contractor The attacker will then weaponize the PLC and deliberately cause a fault on the PLC By doing so the victim engineer will be lured to the PLC in order to diagnose it Through the diagnosis process the integrator will do an upload procedure and have their machine compromised After gaining access to the integrators machine which by design is able to access many other PLCs attackers could in turn attack and even weaponize newly accessible PLCs inside other organizations broadening their control even furtherThis attack vector is useful from a defensive perspective where it could be used to trap attackers Given that attackers often use the same commercial tools as engineers defenders can purposely set up publicly facing weaponized PLCs and allow attackers to interact with them These PLCs will act as a honeypot attracting attackers to interact with themHowever if an attacker falls into the trap and performs an upload from the decoy PLC as part of the enumeration process the weaponized code will execute on the attacking machine This method can be used to detect attacks in the early stage of enumeration and might also deter attackers from targeting internet-facing PLCs since they will need to secure themselves against the target they planned to attackWe decided to focus on the following seven targetsFor each targetplatform we tried to understand the whole downloadupload mechanism by reverse engineering the firmware and the engineering workstation software Our goal was to find discrepancies between what the PLC is using and what engineering workstation is using If we were to find such inconsistencies we could weaponize the PLC through a malicious download procedure to store a specifically crafted piece of data that wont affect the PLC but when parsed by the engineering platform it will trigger and exploit a vulnerabilityThe research process of our Evil PLC Attack is as followsSetup Setting up a testbed environment with a target PLC compatible engineering workstation and IO field devicesBuilding Hello World Reading PLC manuals watching instructional videos and building a benign program to control simple processesProject File Explore what is being stored in a project file metadata configurations textcode and how the data is serializedReverse Engineering Exploring the PLC hardware and firmware in addition to the engineering workstation softwareUploadDownload Procedures Understand the mechanics of the uploaddownload procedures and what data is transferred through the proprietary protocolProtocol Analysis Analyze the proprietary protocol and its functionality and build a fully featured clientFind Discrepancies Understand the differences between what information is transferred and stored in the PLC without being parsed or usedHunt for Vulnerabilities Research all the parsing code flows of all pieces of information that the engineering workstation transfers to the PLC that are not usedmodified on the PLCWeaponize Using the client implement a malicious download procedure that stores specifically crafted data on the PLCExploit Engineer connects to the PLC and performs an upload procedure The engineering workstation parses the specifically crafted data we implemented The parsing flow triggers the vulnerability and executes our codeFor each target vendor platform the full ecosystem that we needed to research consist ofThe engineering workstation softwareEngineering workstation project fileProprietary protocol PLC Engineering workstationPLC firmwareLogic code bytecode textcodeUsing our thorough research methods we were able to find previously unreported vulnerabilities that allowed us to weaponize the affected PLCs and attack engineering workstations whenever an upload procedure occurred All of the findings were reported to the seven affected vendors in accordance with Team82s coordinated disclosure policyAll of the vulnerabilities described in this paper were reported to the affected vendors in accordance with Team82s Coordinated Disclosure policy Most vendors issued fixes patches or mitigation plans against the Evil PLC AttackThat said getting to 100 patching level especially in critical infrastructure is not easy and therefore requires additional mitigation steps to reduce the risk of the Evil PLC Attack Here are a few we recommendIn the Evil PLC attack technique weaponizing is the first step and therefore we recommend limiting physical and network access to PLCs as much as possible There is no question that such devices shouldn't be accessible externally or exposed online But also internal access should be limited to authorized engineers and operators onlyThe process of securing the connection to your PLCs is long tedious and when implemented incorrectly even ineffective so we recommend implementing the followingNetwork Segmentation and Hygiene The first step in securing the connection to your PLCs is limiting access by strictly segmenting your network Allow access to your PLCs only to a small set of engineering workstations which reduces the attack surface in your network considerablyUse Client Authentication It is crucial to configure the PLC to use a client authentication mechanism to validate the identity of the client the engineering station Currently some vendors implement such communication protocols where instead of allowing any engineering workstation to communicate with the PLC only a specific and predefined set of engineering workstations are able interact with the PLC by requiring the engineering workstation to present the PLC with a certificateEven Better PKI A more robust solution is to use a full Public Key Infrastructure PKI system to validate and encrypt all traffic between the client engineering workstation and the server the PLC Mutual authentication more commonly referred to as mutual TLS helps to significantly reduce the risk of someone hacking your OT assets However the reality is that PKI is not yet implemented in many ICS product linesNetwork Traffic Monitoring The Evil PLC attack vector involves performing downloadupload procedures tofrom a PLC As such it is important to monitor your OT network traffic and detect these types of events in particular and if such a procedure would occur in an unexpected situation it could indicate an exploitation attemptStay Up To Date As attackers and defenders alike research this new attack vector further more vulnerabilities like the ones shown above will be discovered and OT vendors will patch those vulnerabilities It is important to stay up to date with your OT software which will protect you from attacks exploiting those one-day vulnerabilitiesCWE-749 Exposed Dangerous Method or FunctionWhen user authentication is not enabled the shell can execute commands with the highest privileges

        "title": "Process injection breaking all macOS security layers with a single vulnerability Sector 7",
        "text": "If you have created a new macOS app with Xcode 132 you may noticed this new method in the templateThis was added to the Xcode template to address a process injection vulnerability we reportedIn October 2021 Apple fixed CVE-2021-30873 This was a process injection vulnerability affecting essentially all macOS AppKit-based applications We reported this vulnerability to Apple along with methods to use this vulnerability to escape the sandbox elevate privileges to root and bypass the filesystem restrictions of SIP In this post we will first describe what process injection is then the details of this vulnerability and finally how we abused itThis research was also published at Black Hat USA 2022 and DEF CON 30Process injection is the ability for one process to execute code in a different process In Windows one reason this is used is to evade detection by antivirus scanners for example by a technique known as DLL hijacking This allows malicious code to pretend to be part of a different executable In macOS this technique can have significantly more impact than that due to the difference in permissions two applications can haveIn the classic Unix security model each process runs as a specific user Each file has an owner group and flags that determine which users are allowed to read write or execute that file Two processes running as the same user have the same permissions it is assumed there is no security boundary between them Users are security boundaries processes are not If two processes are running as the same user then one process could attach to the other as a debugger allowing it to read or write the memory and registers of that other process The root user is an exception as it has access to all files and processes Thus root can always access all data on the computer whether on disk or in RAMThis was in essence the same security model as macOS until the introduction of SIP also known as rootless This name doesnt mean that there is no root user anymore but it is now less powerful on its own For example certain files can no longer be read by the root user unless the process also has specific entitlements Entitlements are metadata that is included when generating the code signature for an executable Checking if a process has a certain entitlement is an essential part of many security measures in macOS The Unix ownership rules are still present this is an additional layer of permission checks on top of them Certain sensitive files eg the Mailapp database and features eg the webcam are no longer possible with only root privileges but require an additional entitlement In other words privilege escalation is not enough to fully compromise the sensitive data on a MacFor example using the following command we can see the entitlements of MailappIn the output we see the following entitlementThis is what grants Mailapp the permission to read the SIP protected mail database while other malware will not be able to read itAside from entitlements there are also the permissions handled by Transparency Consent and Control TCC This is the mechanism by which applications can request access to for example the webcam microphone and in recent macOS versions also files such as those in the Documents and Download folders This means that even applications that do not use the Mac Application sandbox might not have access to certain features or filesOf course entitlements and TCC permissions would be useless if any process can just attach as a debugger to another process of the same user If one application has access to the webcam but the other doesnt then one process could attach as a debugger to the other process and inject some code to steal the webcam video To fix this the ability to debug other applications has been heavily restrictedChanging a security model that has been used for decades to a more restrictive model is difficult especially in something as complicated as macOS Attaching debuggers is just one example there are many similar techniques that could be used to inject code into a different process Apple has squashed many of these techniques but many other ones are likely still undiscoveredMore dangerous than a process injection vulnerability in one application is a process injection technique that affects multiple or even all applications This would give access to a large number of different entitlements and TCC permissions A generic process injection vulnerability affecting all applications is a very powerful tool as well demonstrate in this postWhen shutting down a Mac it will prompt you to ask if the currently open windows should be reopened the next time you log in This is a part of functionally called saved state or persistent UIWhen reopening the windows it can even restore new documents that were not yet saved in some applicationsIt is used in more places than just at shutdown For example it is also used for a feature called App Nap When application has been inactive for a while has not been the focused application not playing audio etc then the system can tell it to save its state and terminates the process macOS keeps showing a static image of the applications windows and in the Dock it still appears to be running while it is not When the user switches back to the application it is quickly launched and resumes its state Internally this also uses the same saved state functionalityWhen building an application using AppKit support for saving the state is for a large part automatic In some cases the application needs to include its own objects in the saved state to ensure the full state can be recovered for example in a document-based applicationEach time an application loses focus it writes to the filesThe windowsplist file contains a list of all of the applications open windows And some other things that dont look like windows such as the menu bar and the Dock menuFor example a windowsplist for TextEditapp could look like thisFor exampleWhenever an application is launched AppKit will read these files and restore the windows of the application This happens automatically without the app needing to implement anything The code for reading these files is quite careful if the application crashed then maybe the state is corrupted too If the application crashes while restoring the state then the next time the state is discarded and it does a fresh startThe vulnerability we found is that the encrypted serialized object stored in the datadata file was not using secure coding To explain what that means well first explain serialization vulnerabilities in particular on macOSMany object-oriented programming languages have added support for binary serialization which turns an object into a bytestring and back Contrary to XML and JSON these are custom language specific formats In some programming languages serialization support for classes is automatic in other languages classes can opt-inIn many of those languages these features have lead to vulnerabilities The problem in many implementations is that an object is created first and then its type is checked Methods may be called on these objects when creating or destroying them By combining objects in unusual ways it is sometimes possible to gain remote code execution when a malicious object is deserialized It is therefore not a good idea to use these serialization functions for any data that might be received over the network from an untrusted partyIn Objective-C classes can implement the NSCoding protocol to be serializable Subclasses of NSCoder such as NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver can be used to serialize and deserialize these objectsHow this works in practice is as follows A class that implements NSCoding must include a methodIn this method this object can use coder to decode its instance variables using methods such as -decodeObjectForKey -decodeIntegerForKey -decodeDoubleForKey etc When it uses -decodeObjectForKey the coder will recursively call -initWithCoder on that object eventually decoding the entire graph of objectsA protocol that enables encoding and decoding in a manner that is robust against object substitution attacksThis means that instead of creating an object first and then checking its type a set of allowed classes needs to be included when decoding an objectSo instead of the unsafe constructionThe following must be usedThis means that when a secure coder is created -decodeObjectForKey is no longer allowed but -decodeObjectOfClassforKey must be usedThat makes exploitable vulnerabilities significantly harder but it could still happen One thing to note here is that subclasses of the specified class are allowed If for example the NSObject class is specified then all classes implementing NSCoding are still allowed If only NSDictionary are expected and an imported framework contains a rarely used and vulnerable subclass of NSDictionary then this could also create a vulnerabilityIn all of Apples operating systems these serialized objects are used all over the place often for inter-process exchange of data For example NSXPCConnection heavily relies on secure serialization for implementing remote method calls In iMessage these serialized objects are even exchanged with other users over the network In such cases it is very important that secure coding is always enabledIn the datadata file for saved states objects were stored using an NSKeyedArchiver without secure coding enabled This means we could include objects of any class that implements the NSCoding protocol The likely reason for this is that applications can extend the saved state with their own objects and because the saved state functionality is older than NSSecureCoding Apple couldnt just upgrade this to secure coding as this could break third-party applicationsBy decompiling a large number of -initWithCoder methods in AppKit we eventually found a combination of 2 objects that we could use to call arbitrary Objective-C methods on another deserialized objectWe start with NSRuleEditor The -initWithCoder method of this class creates a binding to an object from the same archive with a key path also obtained from the archiveThis binds the property binding of the receiver to the keyPath of observable A keypath a string that can be used for example to access nested properties of the object But the more common method for creating bindings is by creating them as part of a XIB file in XcodeFor example suppose the model is a class Person which has a property property readwrite copy NSString name Then you could bind the value of a text field to the name keypath of a Person to create a field that shows and can edit the persons nameIn the XIB editor this would be created as followsIn this case we use it to call -draw on the next objectThe next object we use is an NSCustomImageRep object This obtains a selector a method name as a string and an object from the archive When the -draw method is called it invokes the method from the selector on the object It passes itself as the first argumentBy deserializing these two classes we can now call zero-argument methods and multiple argument methods although the first argument will be an NSCustomImageRep object and the remaining arguments will be whatever happens to still be in those registers Nevertheless is a very powerful primitive Well cover the rest of the chain we used in a future blog postFirst of all we escaped the Mac Application sandbox with this vulnerability To explain that some more background on the saved state is necessaryIn a sandboxed application many files that would be stored in Library are stored in a separate container instead So instead of saving its state inSandboxed applications save their state toApparently when the system is shut down while an application is still running when the prompt is shown asking the user whether to reopen the windows the next time the first location is symlinked to the second one by talagent We are unsure of why it might have something to do with upgrading an application to a new version which is sandboxedSecondly most applications do not have access to all files Sandboxed applications are very restricted of course but with the addition of TCC even accessing the Downloads Documents etc folders require user approval If the application would open an open or save panel it would be quite inconvenient if the user could only see the files that that application has access to To solve this a different process is launched when opening such a panel comappleappkitxpcopenAndSavePanelService Even though the window itself is part of the application its contents are drawn by openAndSavePanelService This is an XPC service which has full access to all files When the user selects a file in the panel the application gains temporary access to that file This way users can still browse their entire disk even in applications that do not have permission to list those filesAs it is an XPC service with service type Application it is launched separately for each appWhat we noticed is that this XPC Service reads its saved state but using the bundle ID of the app that launched it As this panel might be part of the saved state of multiple applications it does make some sense that it would need to separate its state per applicationAs it turns out it reads its saved state from the location outside of the container but with the applications bundle IDBut as we mentioned if the app was ever open when the user shut down their computer then this will be a symlink to the container pathThus we can escape the sandbox in the following wayThe comappleappkitxpcopenAndSavePanelService process will now deserialize the malicious object giving us code execution in a non-sandboxed processThis was fixed earlier than the other issues as CVE-2021-30659 in macOS 113 Apple addressed this by no longer loading the state from the same location in comappleappkitxpcopenAndSavePanelServiceSome applications have an entitlement of comappleprivateAuthorizationServices containing the value systeminstallapple-software This means that this application is allowed to install packages that have a signature generated by Apple without authorization from the user For example Install Command Line Developer Toolsapp and Bootcamp Assistantapp have this entitlement A2nkF also found a package signed by Apple that contains a vulnerability macOSPublicBetaAccessUtilitypkg When this package is installed to a specific disk it will run as root a post-install script from that disk The script assumes it is being installed to a disk containing macOS but this is not checked Therefore by creating a malicious script at the same location it is possible to execute code as root by installing this packageThe exploitation steps are as followsIn the writeup from A2nkF the post-install script ran without the filesystem restrictions of SIP It inherited this from the installation process which needs it as package installation might need to write to SIP protected locations This was fixed by Apple post- and pre-install scripts are no longer SIP exempt The package and its privilege escalation can still be used however as Apple still uses the same vulnerable installer packageNow that we have escaped the sandbox and elevated our privileges to root we did want to bypass SIP as well To do this we looked around at all available applications to find one with a suitable entitlement Eventually we found something on the macOS Big Sur Beta installation disk image macOS Update Assistantapp has the comapplerootlessinstallheritable entitlement This means that this process can write to all SIP protected locations and it is heritable which is convenient because we can just spawn a shell Although it is supposed to be used only during the beta installation we can just copy it to a normal macOS environment and run it thereThe exploitation for this is quite simpleWhen exempt from SIPs filesystem restrictions we can read all files from protected locations such as the users Mailapp mailbox We can also modify the TCC database which means we can grant ourselves permission to access the webcam microphone etc We could also persist our malware on locations which are protected by SIP making it very difficult to remove by anyone other than Apple Finally we can change the database of approved kernel extensions This means that we could load a new kernel extension silently without user approval When combined with a vulnerable kernel extension or a codesigning certificate that allows signing kernel extensions we would have been able to gain kernel code execution which would allow disabling all other restrictions tooWe recorded the following video to demonstrate the different steps It first shows that the application Sandbox is sandboxed then it escapes its sandbox and launches Privesc This elevates privileges to root and launches SIP Bypass Finally this opens a reverse shell that is exempt from SIPs filesystem restrictions which is demonstrated by writing a file in vardbSystemPolicyConfiguration the location where the database of approved kernel modules is storedApple first fixed the sandbox escape in 113 by no longer reading the saved state of the application in comappleappkitxpcopenAndSavePanelService CVE-2021-30659Fixing the rest of the vulnerability was more complicated Third-party applications may store their own objects in the saved state and these objects might not support secure coding This brings us back to the method from the introduction -applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState Applications can now opt-in to requiring secure coding for their saved state by returning TRUE from this method Unless an app opts in it will keep allowing non-secure coding which means process injection might remain possibleThis does highlight one issue with the current design of these security measures downgrade attacks The code signature and therefore entitlements of an application will remain valid for a long time and the TCC permissions of an application will still work if the application is downgraded A non-sandboxed application could just silently download an older vulnerable version of an application and exploit that For the SIP bypass this would not work as macOS Update Assistantapp does not run on macOS Monterey because certain private frameworks no longer contain the necessary symbols But that is a coincidental fix in many other cases older applications may still run fine This vulnerability will therefore be present for as long as there is backwards compatibility with older macOS applicationsNevertheless if you write an Objective-C application please make sure you add -applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState to return TRUE and to adapt secure coding for all classes used for your saved statesIn the current security architecture of macOS process injection is a powerful technique A generic process injection vulnerability can be used to escape the sandbox elevate privileges to root and to bypass SIPs filesystem restrictions We have demonstrated how we used the use of insecure deserialization in the loading of an applications saved state to inject into any Cocoa process This was addressed by Apple as CVE-2021-30873"

contains a vulgar insult in Russian towards Vladimir Putin researchers saidWeve no idea if this location is actually the admins home however it emphasizes the spirit of defiance and resistance in which the forum is built they observedTop Services Offered Of the specific services being hawked on the site DDoS attacks seem likely to be among those that will gain the most traction researchers noted This is because DDoS attacks and defacement activity have returned in a major way since the onset of the war they said These attacks largely have come from an army of hacktivist actors operating on behalf of both sidesThe specific DDoS services advertised on the site allow users to order DDoS attacks on any network resource quickly qualitatively effectively with a power range of up to 500 gbps priced at 80 an hour Layer 4 attacks are priced at 500 for 24 hours while Layer 7 attacks priced at 600 for the same amount of time researchers saidA forum post already confirmed successful defacement activity directed against the Russian state website of the Ministry of Construction Housing and Communal Services of the Russian Federation they addedThe forum also has a distinct focus on advertising information servicesalso known as probivwhich is a type of quid-pro-quo service in which a user provides a piece of personal data belonging to an individual and in return for a fee receives other information associated with this targetThe probiv services on the forum are primarily directed against Russian and Belarussian government agencies financial institutions and mobile network carriers researchers said Information of interest includes Russian passport details data from local wanted lists and criminal records data regarding suspects or persons of interests migrant information information related to buying tickets for transportation out of Russia or lists of citizens convicted of possessing illegal weaponsA Look AheadGoing forward the site could potentially play a major role in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a hub for hacktivists and patriotic cyber threat actors as a symbol of resistance and making a demonstrable difference on the cyber battlefield researchers notedHowever its choice to operate with content almost exclusively written in Russia is a curious one and could pose a potential challenge as non-Russian speaking entities who want to join in the cause for Ukraine will be excluded from the forum researchers notedOn the other hand it suggests that the forums goal is to target members within the Russian federation who can mount attacks from within the country and who likely wouldnt speak Ukrainian while most Ukrainians speak Russian fluently and would also be able to participate they saidThe forums current open nature that allows anyone to join could also represent an operational security risk with some users requesting an invite-only system to protect users from potential retaliation from pro-Russia entities

        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories10 Aug 2022 minute readTable of ContentsAuthorsDeathStalker has indeed continuously leveraged and updated its VileRAT toolchain against the same type of targets since we first identified it in June 2020 While we comprehensively documented the evolution to our threat intelligence customers recently and despite existing public indicators of compromise we regret to note that the campaign is not only ongoing at the time of writing but also that DeathStalker likely increased its efforts to compromise targets using this toolchain recently We have indeed been able to identify more samples of VileRAT-associated malicious files and new infrastructure since March 2022 which may be a symptom of an increase in compromise attempts We deemed it may be helpful to publicly expose some of our knowledge about VileRAT to help potential targets better detect and stop such malicious activitiesBack in the summer of 2020 DeathStalkers VileRAT initial infection consisted in spear-phishing emails sent to foreign exchange companies from fake personas a fake diamonds trading company for instance who shared investment interests Should the target reply and continue with the conversation the fake persona would at some point and upon request provide a link to a malicious file hosted on Google Drive a Windows shortcut file masquerading as a PDF or in a ZIP archive as identification documents The malicious link would then trigger the execution of arbitrary system commands to drop a harmless decoy document as well as a malicious and quite sophisticated binary loader that we dubbed VileLoaderMore recently since at least late 2021 the infection technique has changed slightly but the initial infection vector is still a malicious message a Word document DOCX see Figure 1 is sent to targets via email either as an attachment or embedded in the email body whenever possible In July 2022 we also noticed that the attackers leveraged chatbots that are embedded in targeted companies public websites to send malicious DOCX to their targetsFigure 1 Malicious DOCX social engineering messageThe DOCX documents are frequently named using the compliance or complaint keywords as well as the name of the targeted company suggesting the attacker is answering an identification request or expressing an issue as a reason to send themThe initial infection and toolset deployment as we observed them starting in at least late 2021 are schematized below see Figure 2Figure 2 VileRAT infection and toolset overviewThe initial DOCX infection document itself is innocuous but it contains a link to another malicious and macro-enabled DOTM document as a remote template see Figure 3 These DOTM files are automatically downloaded by Word when the DOCX is opened and its embedded macro is triggered if the recipient enabled execution as requested by the social engineering message see Figure 1Figure 3 Malicious remote template inclusion in infection DOCXThis technique comes with a drastic limitation the hidden macro ie internal p-code can only be executed if the macro-enabled document is opened with the same Office version from which it was generated Otherwise the hidden macro cannot run and the visible one will be executed instead In this last case DeathStalker ensured it would result in a popup message to the user see Figure 4 But most of all DeathStalker ensured that it distributed several variants of infection documents to their targets each one being prepared for a specific Office versionFigure 4 VBA stomping failure in a malicious DOTM remote templateIn any case the visible and hidden macros download a picture to replace the social engineering message in the infection document see Figure 5 and trick the readers into believing something failedFigure 5 Example of a downloaded image upon macro executionThe DOTM-embedded macro itself already reveals some interesting and specific techniques It is lightly obfuscated as most text strings are XOR-encoded see Figure 6 with a password that is derived from a sentence egOperates Catholic small towns pueblos Two ofFigure 6 XOR decoding function renamed for clarity in DOTM-embedded macroFigure 7 XOR decoding function in a PowerPepper VBS loader MD5 DB6D1F6AB887383782E4E3D6E4AACDD0Figure 8 TextBox form used as a data store within malicious DOTM documents as shown by Microsofts VBA editorFigure 9 DOTM-embedded macro leverages AddPicture as a Web clientIn any case the DOTM-embedded macro finally triggers VileDroppers execution using a renamed copy of the WScript interpreter msdcatexe or msgmftexe in the APPDATA folder with a command such aschangelogtxt is VileDropper while 91 is part of password used by VileDropper to decode XORed data and patterntxt is an encoded package that contains VileLoaderNext in DeathStalkers intricate VileRAT infection chain comes VileDropper It is an obfuscated JavaScript file that mainly drops and schedules the execution of the next stage VileLoaderFigure 10 VileDropper code excerpt in its original formVileDropper needs at least two arguments to run for the first time a third may be used as a flag to trigger environment-specific execution variations depending on security products that are installed on targeted computersVileDropper also checks its interpreter and file name to immediately stop execution if it is not called as planned this is probably done to evade sandboxes as can be seen in the following deobfuscated code excerptFigure 11 Deobfuscated execution check in VileDropperVileDroppers exact execution flow depends on the security products that are installed on the targeted computer but most of the time it copies itself to another file relaunches itself and deletes its original copy During execution VileDropperVileDropper sends data to a C2 server using an HTTP GET request to a fixed URL eg hxxphubflashcoadminauthphp using a preset User-Agent both the C2 URL and the User-Agent change depending on VileDropper samples The useful information is stored as a JSON document which is then XOR-encoded base64-encoded URL-encoded and set as a cookie value in the HTTP requestThe characters between square brackets such as u in the command line designate the content of the corresponding JSON key ie u is the encoded target identifierBefore moving on to VileLoader a note on the XOR encoding scheme that is leveraged by VileDropper to protect data sent to the C2 server as similar schemes will be used further on The algorithm generates data blobs that are laid out as follows then sometimes further base64-encoded and URL-encodedType AThe resulting blobs are self-sufficient and can be decoded by the recipient as well as any third party without any access to the pre-shared key In VileDropper strings that are encoded as part of the JavaScript obfuscation benefit from an additional XORing step the XOR key that is embedded in data blobs is additionally XORed with a script-specific fixed password a part of this fixed password is passed to VileDropper on its execution command line by the previous DOTM macro in the infection chain the other part is hard-coded in VileDropper itselfLater VileLoader and VileRAT use other variants of this algorithm which produces data blobs that are laid out as one of the following optionsType BType CType DRecent VileLoader samples are composed of a binary executable stage 1 and an encoded companion shellcode file stage 2 Previous samples of VileLoader usually embedded the shellcode within the binary executable directly and presented themselves as a single monolithic fileVileLoader is initially presented as a binary executable which ensures the first stage of the execution This binary is always a legitimate one which is meticulously doctored by the attackers to integrate a malicious unpacker-type payload As such the binary may appear legitimate from a quick automated static code analysis perspective it includes all the code of a legitimate application but will not work as expected This unpacker stage is aimed at decoding loading and executing the second stage in memoryVileLoaders workflow starts by waiting 17 seconds Then it parses the command line arguments The command line must include five arguments at least or VileLoader terminates the execution In practice VileDropper usually gives seven arguments to VileLoader as we have previously described VileLoader then opens its encoded companion shellcode file whose name is passed as a second argument to VileLoader eg devENX1C6SStmp reads and decodes it using the Type B XOR algorithm maps the deobfuscated data in a region with read write and execute RWX permissions and runs the next stage stage 2 by starting a new threadVileLoaders first stage contains very unique signature techniques that have been stable since the first sample we analyzed in Q2 2020Figure 12 VileLoaders stage 1 custom-made system callThe second stage content is extracted from VileLoaders encoded companion shellcode file and run by VileLoaders first stage in-memory in a new thread From a data perspective the second stage shellcode once unpacked by the first stage is a PE binary that is stripped of its headers and embeds additional encoded dataFinally VileLoaders second stage builds an HTTP GET request that is used to download an implant package In older VileLoader samples the downloader used a static URL that looked as followsThe only evasion attempt consisted in randomly choosing an HTTP User-Agent header value amongst a fixed list of four VileLoader used the targeted systems uptime as a source of randomness In recent samples developers tried to improve these evasion techniques and the HTTP request now looks like thisAll values that are colored in red are now chosen at random from a hard-coded list that is decoded from the stage 2 content using the Type C XOR algorithm The encrypted blob cookie value is initially a JSON dictionary encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using the key BD DE 96 D2 9C 68 EE 06 49 64 D1 E5 8A 86 05 12 B0 9A 50 00 4E F2 E4 92 5C 76 AB FC 90 23 DF C6 decoded from stage 2 content XORed using the Type B XOR algorithm base64-encoded and URL-encoded The actual JSON content is very similar to the one that is sent by VileDropper to the C2 serverThe C2 server then answers in the HTTP response body with one of the following instructionsIn older variants VileLoaders second stage did not embed the screenshot capability which was however implemented in VileRATIf the C2 server requests a screenshot then VileLoader stage 2 sends an HTTP POST request with a cookie whose value is a XORed Type B algorithm JSON dictionary containing the following fieldsThe associated HTTP POST body data is an encoded using the Type B XOR algorithm JPEG screenshotLong story short the first stage of VileRAT has been obfuscated at the Python bytecode-level with the intention of breaking existing decompilers see Figure 13 The bytecode is obfuscated byFigure 13 VileRATs first stage Python bytecode in its original form left and deobfuscated form right The only useful instructions of this excerpt are highlighted in redOnce cleaned at bytecode-level the first stage of VileRAT unpacking can be properly decompiled as Python codeThe last unpacking step finally extracts the VileRAT Python code and a whole bundle of its dependencies in memory all this content causes py2exe-bundled VileRAT samples to weigh around 12MB The unpacking leverages decoding using the Type B XOR algorithm and BZIP2 decompression The final VileRAT Python package notably contains a confpyc module which includes a version number as well as default C2 domain namesVileRAT versions and functionalitiesWe analyzed and compared various VileRAT samples containing version numbers ranging from 24 to 8 VileRAT functionalities have not changed much over time and some functionalities from the earliest sample we analyzed have actually been dropped

as we identified in 2022 the implant is started with the following argumentsNote than in this case the target identifier that is passed as the first argument is not actually exploited by VileRAT and may just be used by the attacker to easily identify running VileRAT processes later Older VileRAT variants were usually launched with explicit -f and -t command line switches those are now implicit and enabled by defaultHere is the list of some notable VileRAT changes we spotted as the versions evolved apart from regular updates to fix code bugs or handle uncaught exceptions refactor code update dependencies and change configurationVileRATs main C2 communication loop as executed during Main C2 client mode as described in VileRAT functionalities above is quite straightforward and runs in a separate threadFigure 14 VileRAT C2 request preparation functionJust as in VileLoader the User-Agent value in HTTP requests is randomly selected from a fixed list of possible values The JSON that is passed to the C2 server can be broken down as followsThe C2 answer is expected as an encoded and encrypted JSON list leveraging the same coding and cryptographic methods as for the JSON in the HTTP request Each item in the list must be a JSON dictionary that contains at least a cmd key Its value can be one of updatesvc sshrshell rcmd sshrdyn or updateconf Additional JSON keyvalue pairs can exist in the dictionary and are passed to internal commands as parametersWe looked for specificities in the C2 domains we could retrieve from the samples gathered either malicious DOCX files DOTM files and their macros VileDropper VileLoader or VileRAT and that are described in this report We ignored domains registered before mid-October 2021 because most of them were already disclosed in public sources all known malicious domains and IPs are listed in full in the indicators of compromise section below It should be noted that to date we have identified hundreds of domains associated with VileRATs infection chainThis allowed us to identify some likely VileRAT-specific infrastructure creation preferencesFrom August 2021 to the present day using only data that we could check with our own telemetry we identified 10 compromised or targeted organizations in Bulgaria Cyprus Germany the Grenadines Kuwait Malta the United Arab Emirates and the Russian Federation see Figure 15Figure 15 Map of organizations targeted by DeathStalkers VileRAT campaign darker color indicates a higher concentrationWe could not profile all the identified organizations but half of them were foreign currency FOREX and cryptocurrency exchange brokers Some identified malicious documents and infrastructure domains contain parts of the targeted organizations names and confirm this targetingIt should be noted that the identified organizations range from recent startups to established industry leaders including dubious cryptocurrency exchange platforms Locating such organizations is extremely difficult from the limited data we have at hand because a small FOREX company might for instance host its infrastructure in various foreign countries employ several remote workers from different countries and be legally based in a tax havenWe still believe with high confidence that the described updated implants and associated infection chain are developed and operated by DeathStalkerVileRAT its loader and associated infection chain were continuously and frequently updated for more than two years and are still leveraged to persistently target foreign currency and cryptocurrency exchange brokers with a clear intent to escape detectionEscaping detection has always been a goal for DeathStalker for as long as weve tracked the threat actor But the VileRAT campaign took this desire to another level it is undoubtedly the most intricate obfuscated and tentatively evasive campaign we have ever identified from this actor From state-of-the-art obfuscation with VBA and JS to multi-layered and low-level packing with Python a robust multi-stage in-memory PE loader and security vendor-specific heuristic bypasses nothing has been left to chanceConsidering the vast and quickly changing associated infrastructure as well there is no doubt DeathStalker is making a tremendous effort to develop and maintain accesses Yet there are some glitches and inconsistencies a final payload weighing more than 10MB VileRAT simple infection vectors lots of suspicious communication patterns noisy and easily identified process executions or file deployments as well as sketchy development practices leaving bugs and requiring frequent implant updates As a result an efficient and properly setup endpoint protection solution will still be able to detect and block most of VileRATs related malicious activitiesPutting these facts into perspective we believe DeathStalkers tactics and practices are nonetheless sufficient and have proven to be to act on soft targets who may not be experienced enough to withstand such a level of determination who may not have made security one of their organizations top priorities or who frequently interact with third parties that did not do so We still however

x arguments along with a specific drive path to encryptIn this case -t 8 sets the ransomware thread count to eight -x commands the malware to self melt and the E value sets the path the entire drive in this case to be encrypted The ransomware functionality is the same as described in the Stairwell reportThe malware created two key files to implement file encryptionPivoting on the exfiltration information to the adjacent hosts we discovered additional victims in India One of these hosts was initially compromised in February 2021 In all likelihood Andariel stole elevated credentials to deploy this malware within the target organization but this speculation is based on paths and other artifacts and we do not have any further detailsThe primary objective of this malware is the same as in the case of the aforementioned victim in Japan using different login credentials and local IP address to exfiltrate dataWindows commands to exfiltrate dataFrom the same victim we discovered additional DTrack malware MD5 87e3fc08c01841999a8ad8fe25f12fe4 using different login credentialsThe minips1 script is responsible for downloading and executing the above DTrack malware via bitsadminexeThe other victim operated a vulnerable Weblogic server According to our telemetry the actor compromised this server via the CVE-2017-10271 exploit We saw Andariel abuse identical exploits and compromise WebLogic servers in mid-2019 and previously reported this activity to our Threat Intelligence customers In this case the exploited server executes the Powershell command to fetch the additional script The fetched script is capable of downloading a Powershell script from the server we mentioned above hxxp145232235222usrusersminips1 Therefore we can summarize that the actor abused vulnerable Internet-facing services to deploy their malware at least until the end of 2020The July 2022 CISA alert noted that the healthcare and public health sectors had been targeted with the Maui ransomware within the US However based on our research we believe this operation does not target specific industries and that its reach is global We can confirm that the Japanese housing company was targeted with the Maui ransomware on April 15 2021 Also victims from India Vietnam and Russia were infected within a similar timeframe by the same DTrack malware as used in the Japanese Maui incident from the end of 2020 to early 2021According to the Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine KTAE the DTrack malware from the victim contains a high degree of code similarity 84 with previously known DTrack malwareBased on the modus operandi of this attack we conclude that the actors TTPs behind the Maui ransomware incident is remarkably similar to past AndarielStoneflySilent Chollima activityAuthorsAndariel deploys DTrack and Maui ransomwareYour email address will not be published Required fields are marked Name Email Akshat Pradhan another variant 865078d080e594d1fb5c6985e4100f38Table of ContentsGReAT webinarsFrom the same authorsThe hottest research right in your inboxIn the same categoryAsian APT groups target various organizations from a multitude of regions and industries We created this report to provide the cybersecurity community with the best-prepared intelligence data to effectively counteract Asian APT groupsWe unveil a Lazarus campaign exploiting security company products and examine its intricate connections with other campaignsHow Kaspersky researchers obtained all stages of the Operation Triangulation campaign targeting iPhones and iPads including zero-day exploits validators TriangleDB implant and additional modulesNobody would even suspect the mining malware was merely a mask masquerading behind an intricate modular framework that supports both Linux and Windows The amount of effort that went into creating the framework is truly remarkable and its disclosure was quite astonishingThe hottest research right in your inboxThreatsCategories 2023 AO Kaspersky Lab All Rights ReservedRegistered trademarks and service marks are the property of their respective ownersThe hottest research right in your inbox"

        "text": "August 14th 2022 update below This post was originally published on August 10thCisco confirmed today that the Yanluowang ransomware group breached its corporate network in late May and that the actor tried to extort them under the threat of leaking stolen files onlineThe company revealed that the attackers could only harvest and steal non-sensitive data from a Box folder linked to a compromised employee's accountCisco experienced a security incident on our corporate network in late May 2022 and we immediately took action to contain and eradicate the bad actors a Cisco spokesperson told BleepingComputerCisco did not identify any impact to our business as a result of this incident including Cisco products or services sensitive customer data or sensitive employee information intellectual property or supply chain operationsOn August 10 the bad actors published a list of files from this security incident to the dark web We have also implemented additional measures to safeguard our systems and are sharing technical details to help protect the wider security communityThe Yanluowang threat actors gained access to Cisco's network using an employee's stolen credentials after hijacking the employee's personal Google account containing credentials synced from their browserThe attacker convinced the Cisco employee to accept multi-factor authentication MFA push notifications through MFA fatigue and a series of sophisticated voice phishing attacks initiated by the Yanluowang gang that impersonated trusted support organizationsMFA fatigue is an attack tactic where threat actors send a constant stream of multi-factor authentication requests to annoy a target in the hopes that they will finally accept one to stop them from being generatedThe threat actors finally tricked the victiminto accepting one of the MFA notifications andgained access to the VPN in the context of the targeted userOnce they gained a foothold on the company's corporate network Yanluowang operators spread laterallyto Citrix servers and domain controllersThey moved into the Citrix environment compromising a series of Citrix servers and eventually obtained privileged access to domain controllers Cisco Talos saidAfter gaining domain admin they used enumeration tools like ntdsutil adfind and secretsdump to collect more information andinstalled a series of payloads onto compromised systems including abackdoor malwareUltimately Cisco detected and evicted the attackers from its environment but they continued trying to regain access over the following weeksAfter obtaining initial access the threat actor conducted a variety of activities to maintain access minimize forensic artifacts and increase their level of access to systems within the environment Cisco Talos addedThe threat actor was successfully removed from the environment and displayed persistence repeatedly attempting to regain access in the weeks following the attack however these attempts were unsuccessfulTo help network admins and security professionals detect the malware used in the attack Cisco created two new ClamAV detections for the backdoor and a Windows exploit used for privilege elevationWhile Cisco provided some information on the backdoor and how it was used to remotely execute commands their writeup does not mention any info on the exploit executable that was discoveredWhile the threat actor attempted to use this exploit to raise privileges on Cisco's network the company told BleepingComputer that the attempts were unsuccessfulLast week the threat actor behind the Cisco hack emailed BleepingComputer a directory listing of files allegedly stolen during the attackThe threat actor claimed to have stolen 275GB of data consisting of approximately 3100 files Many of these files are non-disclosure agreements data dumps and engineering drawingsThe threat actors also sent a redacted NDA documentstolen in the attack to BleepingComputer as proof of the attack and a hint that they breached Ciscos network and exfiltrated filesCisco also said that even though the Yanluowang gang is known for encrypting their victims' files it found no evidence of ransomware payloads during the attackWe assess with moderate to high confidence that this attack was conducted by an adversary that has been previously identified as an initial access broker IAB with ties to the UNC2447 cybercrime gang Lapsus threat actor group and Yanluowang ransomware operatorsAugust 14th updateAfter publishing this story the threat actor behind the breach told BleepingComputer that they stole source code during the cyberattackAs proof the hackers shared a screenshot of a VMware vCenter administrator console at a ciscocom URL This vCenter dash shows numerous virtual machines including one named as aGitLab server used by Cisco's CSIRTHowever Cisco states that they have no evidence that source code was stolen during the attackWe have no evidence to suggest the actor accessed Cisco product source code or any substantial access beyond what we have already publicly disclosed Cisco told BleepingComputerUpdate Added more info about Yanluowang activity within Cisco's corporate networkUpdate 81122 Added info on ClamAV detections and exploit executable used in attackUpdate 81422 Added info about threat actor's claims of stealing source code and more info about

        "text": "August 9 2022Weeks after Russia launched its war in Ukraine in February stories began circulating via Facebook and YouTube that President Vladimir Putin invaded only to destroy a secret US and NATO-run lab making a deadly virusThe messages portrayed Putin as the anti-Western hero saving Eastern Europe from an American ploy Washingtons unprecedented rage Destroyed laboratories in Ukraine where the United States was developing advanced biological weapons against Russia Reasons for launching Russian Special Operations What to believe They didnt admit it in Wuhan eitherThe biological weapons storyline that spread online and via email chain letters in Central and Eastern Europe is just one example of the propaganda coming out of Moscow to justify the war in Ukraine and turn public opinion against the West While Meta Twitter and Google say they are working hard to remove these kinds of fake stories from their platforms its nearly impossible to find and dispute all the disinformation circulating online before thousands of people read share like or comment on the phony narrativesThis is where the Elves come inA loosely organized collective of researchers activists technology experts and volunteers from across Central and Eastern Europe the Elves are ordinary citizens who have banded together to fight Russian disinformation about the warThe only cure is that you communicate the facts but this virus narrative works really well because it scares people said Bleise a 38-year-old Czech disinformation researcher working to debunk storylines such as the fake bio-lab posts Bleise asked CyberScoop not to use her real name due to security concernsHer goal along with other Elves is to flag articles or videos for social media platforms as well as to create and publicize an archive of disinformation from Russian troll groups so that researchers and disinformation watchdogs can better detect and more quickly remove posts in the futureTrolls are ugly elves are bright creatures confronting them Hawk the nom de guerre for a founding father of the movement told CyberScoop To be an elf is quite fashionable and we have a lot of supporters Hawk said Because youre fighting against evilToday there are several thousand Elves in chapters in Finland Germany and 11 other countries across the former Eastern bloc including Estonia the Czech Republic Ukraine and Poland The community includes cybersecurity threat researchers psychologists lawyers marketing experts and intelligence expertsThey get more citizens involved in defending democratic values and the integrity of their own information space but also help to amplify and augment the everyday work of civil society counter-disinformation responders The Elves also team up with tech companies offering data analytics and threat intelligence One member of the Elves said he works for Trend Micro the global cybersecurity company and is able to use his expertise to help members mask their real identitiesDisinformation experts say the Elves are playing an increasingly important role in monitoring and debunking Russian disinformation In fact the Elves may be the most important and effective citizen-led response to disinformation in existence said Kevin Sheives an associate director at the International Forum for Democratic Studies at the National Endowment for Democracy and formerly a State Department official specializing in Chinese disinformationThey get more citizens involved in defending democratic values and the integrity of their own information space but also help to amplify and augment the everyday work of civil society counter-disinformation responders Sheives saidWhile the Elves have grown since the Ukraine war the group has existed since 2014 shortly after the Russian invasion of Crimea In the beginning the Elves were just a group of three friends responding to Russian disinformation in the comments section of newspaper websites It was a pretty primitive way but its where we started said Hawk Putin pushed us to stop discussions and start to do something he saidTo date the Elves have cataloged and worked to disrupt thousands of Russian information operations pioneering a model for squelching disinformation that experts said has informed the work of organizations such as the Atlantic Councils Digital Forensic Research Lab and the State Departments Global Engagement CenterEto Buziashvili a Georgia-based disinformation researcher for the Atlantic Councils Digital Forensic Research Lab said the Kremlin is quite aware of the Elves Army and that they have a huge network and of course they are worried because these people are located in many countries and they can detect the Kremlin operations earlyOnce a year the Elves meet in Lithuanias capital Vilnius at what is known as the Elves Academy a conference where members are trained on the latest techniques and tactics for taking down their troll adversaries Its a place where members of the Elves such as Bleise can share their research and approach to hunting disinformationA mother of two Bleise spent years lecturing and writing about disinformation before becoming an Elf The work is exhausting she said But the community of like-minded people working together with a common goal keeps her going She said that while some people think the Elves are crazy activists those in the know realize they are largely skilled professionals donating their time to the causeShe said she occasionally meets other Elves for coffee to arrange some hackathon and finds herself marveling at the fact that she is working with some of the best brains in my countryUltimately said Klekov the Elves just want to make a difference and use the tools at their disposal the internet their community and theirintellects to make a difference It is smart educated people who simply care about values such as freedom of speech and democracy"

        "text": "We have contacted Microsoft support a while ago about the issue that Tutanota users were unable to register Microsoft Teamsaccounts with their Tutanota domain email addresses However Microsoft responded to us that fixing the issue wasnot feasible read original post below for more detailsThey fixed the issue in August finally defining all Tutanota domains as public domains - the way it should be for anemail service and the way we had requested from Microsoft when first contacting themWhile the issue has been resolved pretty quickly by Microsoft after the right people contacted us following the media attention we stillbelieve that this example shows why we need better antitrust regulationsIt is not fair that a Big Tech company can ignore a small company's request to fix an issue that effects its usersfor months and is only interested in fixing the issue after it received bad publicity because of thisAfter all not every small company has the option to go public possibly because the media will decide their issue isnot worth talking about or because they simply do not have established media contacts and find it hard to get throughto the right peopleWhile we are very happy that this particular issue has now been fixed for all Tutanota users we still believethat there must be a better way for companies to contact Big Tech and request fixes from them - one where they can not simply answer to the request with Sorry fixing the issue you are having is not feasible for usPoliticians on both sides of the Atlantic are discussing stronger antitrust legislation to regulate Big Tech These lawsare badly needed as the example of Microsoft blocking Tutanota users from registering a Teams account demonstratesThe problem Big Tech companies have the market power to harm smallercompetitors with some very easy steps like refusing smaller companies customers from using their own servicesCurrently Microsoft is actively blocking Tutanota email addresses from registering a Microsoft Teams accountThis severe anti-competitive practice forces our customers to register a second email address possibly one from Microsoftthemselves to create a Teams accountWhen asked to change the current situation a spokesperson for Microsoft simply said it would not be possible for them toallow people to register a Teams account with a Tutanota email address Period We repeatedly tried to solve the issue withMicrosoft but unfortunately our request was ignoredThis is just one example of how Microsoft can and does abuse its dominant market position to harm competitors which inturn also harms consumersThe last successful antitrust case in tech happened in 1995 against Microsoft At the time Microsoft was one of the biggesttech companies as almost every computer was running Microsoft Windows Back in the nineties Microsoft bundled their InternetExplorer browser into Windows OS so that every computer being sold also came with their built-in browserThe case United States vs Microsoft made the news back then Microsoft lost the case and was no longer allowed to bundlethe Windows operating system with the Internet ExplorerWeakening Microsoft paved the way for a period of technological innovation Following this successful antitrust case newtech companies emerged that have since adopted the practice of abusing their market power to stifle competition themselvesGoogle Facebook Amazon and AppleAt first glance the deal consumers get from Big Tech is very beneficial after all they can use the product for freeHowever targeted advertisement also makes people payBy knowing consumers so well Big Tech can place ads at the right moment and at the right price For every major turnin life the appropriate ad will appear Say you are invited to a baby shower Ultimately you will be bombarded withads for babys clothes and toys but maybe a handmade gift would be much more suitableConsumers will lose the ability to make free and independent decisions due to the never-ending presence of advertisementsand their influenceThe aim of Big Tech is to make you spend money and they are very successful with thatIn recent years the demand for privacy is constantly rising Big Tech companies such as Microsoft can not easily deliverthis as a large part of their business relies on the profits made from targeted advertisements and for that they needto track their usersWe need to break up the market power of Big Tech like we did in the nineties This will lead to a new evolution intodays online world One where products rise that concentrate on benefiting the consumer not maximizing ad revenuesays Pfau To free oneself from being tracked online people need privacy-respecting alternatives We have built afully encrypted email service Tutanota We respect peoples privacy and protect their private emails from maliciousattacks prying eyes and ad-based tracking Due to the built-in encryption tracking is impossible in TutanotaHowever competing with Microsoft is nigh impossible given their sheer market power"

        "text": "A new botnet called 'RapperBot' is being used in attacks since mid-June 2022 focusing on brute-forcing its way into Linux SSH servers to establish a foothold on the deviceThe researchers show that RapperBotis based on the Mirai trojanbut deviates from the the original malware'snormal behavior which is uncontrolled propagation to as many devices as possibleInstead RapperBot is more tightly controlled has limited DDoS capabilities and its operation appears geared towards initial server access likely to be used as stepping stones for lateral movement within a networkOver the past 15 months since its discovery the new botnet used over 3500 unique IPs worldwide to scan and attempt brute-forcing Linux SSH serversThe new botnet was discovered in the wild by threat hunters at Fortinet who noticed the IoT malware featured some unusual SSH-related strings and decided to investigate furtherRapperBot proved to be a Mirai fork but with its own command and control C2 protocol unique features and atypical for a botnet post-compromise activityThe bulk of the malware code contains an implementation of an SSH 20 client that can connect and brute force any SSH server that supports Diffie-Hellmann key exchange with 768-bit or 2048-bit keys and data encryption using AES128-CTRThe SSH brute-forcing relies on a list of credentials downloaded from the C2 via host-unique TCP requests while the malware reports back to the C2 when it succeededFortinet researchers followed the bot and continued to sample new variants noticing that RapperBot used a self-propagation mechanism via a remote binary downloader which was removed by the threat actors in mid-JulyThe newer variants circulating at that time featured a shell command that replaced the victim's SSH keys with the actor's essentially establishing persistence that's maintained even after SSH password changesMoreover RapperBot added a system to append the actor's SSH key to the host's sshauthorizedkeyswhich helps maintain access on the server between reboots or even if the malware is found and deletedIn the most recent samples analyzed by the researchers the bot adds the root user suhelper on the compromised endpoints and creates a Cron job that re-adds the user every hour in case an admin discovers the account and deletes itAlso it's worth noting that the malware authors added extra layers of obfuscation to the strings in later samples like XOR encodingMost botnets either perform DDoS attacks or engage in coin-mining by hijacking the host's available computational resources and some do bothThe goal of RapperBot however isn't evident as the authors have kept its DDoS functions limited and even removed and re-introduced them at some pointAlso the removal of self-propagation and the addition of persistence and detection-avoidance mechanisms indicate that the botnet's operators may be interested in initial access sales to ransomware actorsFortinet reports that its analysts saw no additional payloads delivered post-compromise during the monitoring period so the malware just nests on the infected Linux hosts and sits dormant"

expand its operations through these fraudulent apps and its recruitment of ransomware-as-a-service affiliates By Nathaniel Morales Ivan Nicole Chavez Monte de Jesus Lala Manly Nathaniel Gregory RagasaAugust 02 2022Read time wordsSave to FolioThe League of Legends account checkeron GitHub Figures 2 and 3 is bundled with a file that containsinstructions on how to use the tool Figure 4 but that is the extent of the pretense It has no graphic user interface GUI or any other behavior related to its supposed function When an unsuspecting victim runs the application it automatically executes malicious PowerShell codes that drop the ransomware Another file that comes with the ransomware is named Source code but this seems to be different from the compiled binaryAmong the files bundled with the account checker we also found an executable file named Rust LoL Accounts Checkerexe Figure 5 protected bySafengine Shielden which obfuscates samples and applications to make reverse engineering and analysis more difficultWhen this file is executed an error window appears and claims that debugging tools have been detected Figure 6 which may be one of the malwares anti-virtualization and anti-debugging capabilitiesIf users click on this executable file it will drop and execute Lol Checker x64exe which runs the malicious PowerShell codes that drop and execute the SolidBit ransomware After pivoting the binary file in VirusTotal and AnyRun we found that Rust LoL Accounts Checkerexe downloads and executes Lol Checker x64exe using the following commandcmd c start TEMPLoL Checker x64exeWhen Lol Checker x64exe is executed it will begin disabling Windows Defenders scheduled scans and any real-time scanning of the following folders and file extensionsThe file disables these scans by using the following PowerShell commandcmd c powershell -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath envUserProfileenvAppDataenvTempenvSystemRootenvHomeDriveenvSystemDrive -Force powershell -Command Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension 'exe''dll' -Force exitAfter successfully disabling Windows Defender from scanning these directories the file will drop and execute the file Runtime64exe which we analyzed as the SolidBit ransomware using the following command promptcmd c start TEMPRuntime64exeRansomware analysis of SolidBits new variantThis new version of SolidBit ransomware is a NET compiled binary Figure 7 After opening Runtime64exe using the debugger and NET assembly editor DnSpy we found that this file was obfuscated We used a NET deobfuscator and unpacker tool called de4dot to make the strings readable Figure 8The ransomware creates a mutex and will terminate if another copy of itself is found already running on the machine Figure 9It will also create a registry key to a directory named SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun with the value UpdateTask as its autostart mechanism Figure 10Prior to encryption the ransomware will check if the directory is in the root path and avoids the following files and directories as shown in Figure 11This SolidBit variant uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard AES encryption to encrypt the files in its victims computer Figure 12 A key that is appended in the encrypted files content Figure 13 will act as SolidBits infection marker The key came from a hard-coded string from the binary that was encrypted via Rivest-Shamir-Adleman RSA encryption and was encoded to Base 64 The ransomware will also append the SolidBit file extension to the encrypted files and changes their file icons Figure 14 Its encryption routine only encrypts files with specific file extensionsThis SolidBit variant will also terminate multiple services delete any shadow copies Figure 15 and backup catalogs Figure 16 and delete 42 services in the victims computerIt will also drop a file RESTORE-MY-FILEStxt that contains instructions on how a victim can pay the ransom to every directory Figure 17 and shows a pop-up window on the victims machine Figure 18SolidBit as a LockBit imitatorThe new SolidBit sample is larger than its predecessors at 556 MB compared to the 159 KB of earlier SolidBit variants Its use of a fakeLeague of LegendsAccount Checker application to drop itsransomware payload is a new technique in its arsenalSolidBit posing as social media toolsIn addition to the fraudulent League of Legends account checker application the aforementioned GitHub account has uploaded this new SolidBit variant disguised as other legitimate applications named Social Hacker Figure 23 and Instagram Follower Bot Figure 24 However the account has been taken down at the time of this writingBoth these malicious applications display an error message when executed on a virtual machine Figure 25 They exhibit the same behavior as the fake League of Legends account checker wherein they drop and execute an executable that will in turn drop and execute the SolidBit ransomware payload Figure 26SolidBit as ransomware-as-a-serviceFending off ransomware attacksThe malware authors behind SolidBit ransomware appear to be gearing up to expand their operations through recruiting ransomware-as-a-service partners who will facilitate a wider scale of infection on top of the distribution approach of their newly found variant The large commission percentage that SolidBits authors offer is likely to

PHOSPHORUS UNC788 is a threat actor likely to have been active since at least 2012 It is possibly one of the most active and persistent Iran-based threat actors over the last decade and is known primarily for spoofing log-in pages of legitimate webmail services to collect credentials from its targets The threat actor also has a history of operational security OPSEC errors resulting in disclosure of its tools techniques and procedures TTPs including the addition of Android malware to its expanding toolsetOPSEC mistakes associated with Yellow Garuda operations in late 2021 resulted in the discovery of new tool used to enumerate data from targeted Telegram accounts We also identified an alias tied to early Iran-based operations and a surveillance report likely written by a Yellow Garuda operator Additionally PwC analysts have observed the threat actors use of macro-enabled template files as recently as March 2022 a new TTP not previously associated with Yellow GarudaThrough our regular scanning for Yellow Garuda infrastructure PwC analysts identified an open directory located at 138201145183 containing several compressed archives associated with late 2021 Yellow Garuda activityEach of the RAR archives contained a copy of a tool named NewTelegramLocalGrabberSqliteUIWinexe together with the tools component parts and exfiltrated victim data In total there were seven sets of victim data on the server six of which were outputs of the Telegram grabber tool and one of which was almost certainly the result of data exfiltrated by mobile malware Although it is unclear what malware was used we note that the type of data captured is in line with the capabilities of PINEFLOWER an Android malware previously attributed to Yellow Garuda1These archives had filenames referencing Solar Hijri calendar dates indicating that the activity took place between 7th September and 11th October 2021 when converted to the Gregorian calendar The activity suggests domestic targeting as all victim mobile numbers contained the Iranian country code and Farsi was the main language seen in victim databases as part of Telegram group names or in exfiltrated messages From the data exfiltrated it was also apparent that some of victims were associates of each other where two pairs of victims were contacts of another victim on Telegram We also observed that two of the victims likely had links to the Iranian music industryFigure 1 - Contents of 138201145183The Telegram grabber tool is written in C and uses the open source Telegram Database Library TDLib a cross-platform Telegram client typically used to create custom apps for the platform2 It has been designed to exfiltrate information from a victims Telegram account This includes messages and associated media group memberships and contact dataSHA-2567709a06467b8a10ccfeed72072a0985e4e459206339adaea3afb0169bace024eFilenameNewTelegramLocalGrabberSqliteUIWinexeFile typeWin32 EXEFile size5423104 bytesCompilation timestamp2062-01-30 023048In order to access the victims account the threat actor needs to enter a login code which is issued by Telegram as part of its authentication process The code is sent either to the victims Telegram account or via SMS to the victims phone3 This means that the threat actor needs to have access to a victims active Telegram session either via a phone or desktop or otherwise be able to access their SMS messages for example via mobile malware As can be seen in Figure 2 the victims phone number is required upon opening the tool in order to send the authentication codeFigure 2 GUI to enter victims phone numberIf the victim has enabled two-step verification an additional password is needed Where this is unknown it can be reset using a recovery email if one has been previously setup The tool has options to view the password hint and send an access code via the victims recovery email address which the threat actor would need to access in order to proceed The existence of this option indicates that the threat actor at least in some cases is likely to have access to the victims email account This aligns with Yellow Garudas known tactics which include extensive credential harvesting via dedicated phishing sitesOnce authenticated the operator is presented with multiple options to choose the type of data to download This includes the ability to select a date range for the download of the different types of Telegram chat messages For groups the tool attempts to grab details on the participants as well as whether or not the victim is an administrator The tool is also able to download data relating to the victims profile and their contacts including their names phone numbers usernames and profile picturesFigure 3 Metadata accessed for each contactThe exfiltrated data is stored within a SQLite database and also in JSON format For attachments sent or received through chats there are options to choose specific file formats to download These pertain to common video audio document binary and compressed file extensions In addition to being able to exfiltrate data the threat actor also has the ability to delete messages from the victims accountWe found 15 additional samples of the tool on an online multi-antivirus scanner which share the same filename NewTelegramLocalGrabberSqliteUIWinexe and TypeLib ID 7bb2c20c-740e-498b-8dd6-9c2ff8ad9572 as the sample we analysed The TypeLib ID is a unique GUID created by Visual Studio when a new project is created4 thus indicating that all of the samples originated from the same project The additional samples were all uploaded within a 31 day window between January and February 2021 and contained similar functionality to the one we analysed The main difference was the presence of a web request function that appeared to be used in a testing capacity Given the clustered times of submission and the presence of the web request test method we assess it is likely these samples were submitted by the threat actor itself in a testing capacityThe following Microsoft Word document was found in the directory corresponding to one of the victims whose data was highly likely exfiltrated via mobile malware and not through the Telegram grabber tool Its filename translates to 01Report and its contents detail the status of the surveillance on that victim01docx36c12ff1b62f4579d64926f5a26c4a1806235859a8f71c8754d5b257716be538File typeDOCXFigure 4 Threat actor report left and translation from Farsi to English rightThe report gives us insight into the threat actors specific data collection objectives It references the surveillance of audio and video conversations of the victims phone and confirms the victims name national identity number mobile number and phone model It indicates the surveillance was completed on 11th October 2021 and is being sent for review by the relevant expert on the orders of the manager of 2000 and 2300 numbers which could represent individual operators or departments within Yellow Garudas operations The report ends with a warning that if the surveillance is detected it will not be possible to re-access the phoneThese numbers align with additional observations from the output log files of the Telegram grabber tool which contained local file paths likely belonging to the threat actor An example is as followsFigure 5 Example of file path found in output log files The date converts to 22nd September 2021 in the Gregorian calendarWe observed values of 1500 2700 and 3500 being used as part of the local directory structure This indicates that at least three operators or teams may have contributed to the Telegram grabber activity observed and a further two separate operators or teams worked on the victim referenced in the reportA previously leaked organisational chart associated with Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC shows individual departments with similar numerical referencing Figure 65 From the English translation in Table 1 we can see that several of the observed values are present overlapping with departments related to cyber security and counterintelligence Although we are unable to independently verify the validity of this chart the overlap in naming convention and our understanding that Yellow Garuda is likely associated with the IRGC6 aligns with our assessment that these are operatorteam namesThe author name of the threat actor report llinvisiblell is fairly unique and gives us insight into a potential individual operator This alias was also in use between 2010 and 2016 on the Ashiyane forum a now defunct Iranian hacking forum originally started by the Ashiyane Digital Security Team The Ashiyane Digital Security Team has previously been linked to IRGC activity7 and several of its members appeared in a US Department of Justice DOJ indictment for distributed denial of service DDoS attacks against organisations in the US financial sector and other US-based companies between 2011 and 20138Figure 6 Diagram purportedly showing IRGC-related departments and leads Farsi language 9Table 1 English translation of Figure 6 showing IRGC-related departments and leads numbers overlapping with those observed in our analysis have been highlighted in boldBetween January and March 2022 we observed Yellow Garuda using Microsoft Word document droppers which use remote template injection to obtain and execute a malicious macro This is the first time we have observed the threat actor deploying macros or using remote template injection as part of its attack sequenceSHA-256Filename41b37de3256a5d1577bbed4a04a61bd7bc119258266d2b8f10a9bb7ae7c0d4ecTurkeyinjdocx10725bdf594baa21edf1f3820b0daf393267066717832452598c617552a004e5daTurkeydocx01ca3f6dc5da4b98915dd8d6c19289dcb21b0691df1bb320650c3eb0db3f214cIran-

Microsoft Word document droppers DOCXThe document lures we observed covered a variety of themes including nuclear energy and weapons related to Turkey US shipping ports and Irans relationship to the Taliban and as such we assess they were likely used to target a variety of unrelated entities Many of these lures used material sourced from legitimate English-language websites including news and media sites It is not unusual for threat actors to make use of current affairs as a means to catch the attention of potential victims and the themes are not necessarily indicative of specific targetingFigure 7 Example of lure contentThe initial Microsoft Word document DOCX is hosted on a third party service such as Dropbox or Amazon Web Services AWS Yellow Garuda is known to extensively employ social engineering as part of its attacks therefore it is highly likely phishing was used to coerce a potential victim to download and open the documentOnce opened a form of remote template injection takes place where the document reaches out to a URL to download a file with a DOTM extension a macro-enabled template file The URL is specified within the relationship component wordrelssettingsxmlrels of the initial document as indicated by the Target value in Figure 8 The documents we analysed reached out to files hosted on either Microsoft OneDrive or on dedicated threat actor-controlled infrastructure as can be seen belowFigure 8 URL visible in wordrelssettingsxmlrelsWe were able to access several examples of this second stage macro-enabled template file These differed in functionality and form however they all maintained persistence by replacing the victims default Microsoft Word template meaning that the malicious template and macro will open whenever Microsoft Word is opened by the victimSHA-256Filenamec45bffb5fe7056075b966608e6b6bf82102f722b5c5d8a9c55631e155819d995DocTemplatedotmdd28806d63f628dbc670caaa67379da368e62fa9edfbdfd37d3a91354df08e1cDocTemplatedotmc0d5043b57a96ec00debd3f24e09612bcbc38a7fb5255ff905411459e70a6bb4Detailsdotm28de2ccff30a4f198670b66b6f9a0ce5f5f9b7f889c2f5e6a4e365dea1c89d53ArabicdotmTable 3 Details of malicious template files DOTMIn some cases11 we observed the macro code creating a reverse shell using code almost identical to that found in open source on a GitHub repository12 In other cases13 the template files were password protected meaning that the victim is required to specify the password in order for the attack sequence to proceed This would need to be passed over to the victim via a phishing email or some other form of social engineering The template files also contained RC4-encrypted strings both within the macro and lure document for which the decryption key needed to be obtained as the response to a HTTP GET request to an Amazon S3 bucket These steps were likely designed to thwart analysis attempts if the password cannot be obtained to open the document or the infrastructure hosting the decryption key is no longer activeFiles dropped by the macros shared similar filenames to recent Yellow Garuda activity observed by Check Point14 The PowerShell backdoor known as CharmPower was observed to read data from a file called nitxt located in AppData whose contents are sent to the command and control server along with basic information about the victims machine This aligns with our observations that nitxt is used to house a hardcoded identifier and could indicate that a version of CharmPower is deployed at a later stage of the attack sequenceOver the past year we have seen Yellow Garuda continue to add tools to its arsenal In its use of macro-enabled template files we can see that the threat actor has made efforts to stage various parts of the infection chain remotely disrupting analysis efforts where these are not accessible The threat actor has also continued to make OPSEC mistakes exposing its tools and targeting through open servers The Telegram grabber tool we observed appears to be a tool that the threat actor has had access to since at least January 2021 and used against domestic targets to obtain specific access to Telegram messages and contacts alongside mobile malwareThe threat actors operational report has given us further insight into its analysis process indicating that there is an internal structure to its operations denoted by numerical call signs It also highlights the alias of an individual which has previously been linked to Iran-based activity over several yearsMore detailed information on each of

        "title": "911 Proxy Service Implodes After Disclosing Breach Krebs on Security",
        "text": "The 911 service as it existed until July 28 2022911re a proxy service that since 2015 has sold access to hundreds of thousands of Microsoft Windows computers daily announced this week that it is shutting down in the wake of a data breach that destroyed key components of its business operations The abrupt closure comes ten days after KrebsOnSecurity published an in-depth look at 911 and its connections to shady pay-per-install affiliate programs that secretly bundled 911s proxy software with other titles including free utilities and pirated software911re is was one of the original residential proxy networks which allow someone to rent a residential IP address to use as a relay for hisher Internet communications providing anonymity and the advantage of being perceived as a residential user surfing the webResidential proxy services are often marketed to people seeking the ability to evade country-specific blocking by the major movie and media streaming providers But some of them like 911 build their networks in part by offering free VPN or free proxy services that are powered by software which turns the users PC into a traffic relay for other users In this scenario users indeed get to use a free VPN service but they are often unaware that doing so will turn their computer into a proxy that lets others use their Internet address to transact onlineFrom a websites perspective the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address not from the proxy service customer These services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes such as price comparisons or sales intelligence but they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original sourceA cached copy of flashupdatenet circa 2016 which shows it was the homepage of a pay-per-install affiliate program that incentivized the silent installation of 911s proxy softwareWithin hours of that story 911 posted a notice at the top of its site saying We are reviewing our network and adding a series of security measures to prevent misuse of our services Proxy balance top-up and new user registration are closed We are reviewing every existing user to ensure their usage is legit and in compliance with our Terms of ServiceAt this announcement all hell broke loose on various cybercrime forums where many longtime 911 customers reported they were unable to use the service Others affected by the outage said it seemed 911 was trying to implement some sort of know your customer rules that maybe 911 was just trying to weed out those customers using the service for high volumes of cybercriminal activityThen on July 28 the 911 website began redirecting to a notice saying We regret to inform you that we permanently shut down 911 and all its services on July 28thAccording to 911 the service was hacked in early July and it was discovered that someone manipulated the balances of a large number of user accounts 911 said the intruders abused an application programming interface API that handles the topping up of accounts when users make financial deposits with the serviceNot sure how did the hacker get in the 911 message reads Therefore we urgently shut down the recharge system new user registration and an investigation startedThe parting message from 911 to its users posted to the homepage July 28 2022However the intruders got in 911 said they managed to also overwrite critical 911re servers data and backups of that dataOn July 28th a large number of users reported that they could not log in the system the statement continues We found that the data on the server was maliciously damaged by the hacker resulting in the loss of data and backups Its sic confirmed that the recharge system was also hacked the same way We were forced to make this difficult decision due to the loss of important data that made the service unrecoverableNow many on the crime forums who relied on 911 for their operations are wondering aloud whether there are any alternatives that match the scale and utility that 911 offered The consensus seems to be a resounding noIm guessing we may soon learn more about the security incidents that caused 911 to implode And perhaps other proxy services will spring up to meet what appears to be a burgeoning demand for such services at the moment with comparatively little supplyIn the meantime 911s absence may coincide with a measurable if only short-lived reprieve in unwanted traffic to top Internet destinations including banks retailers and cryptocurrency platforms as many former customers of the proxy service scramble to make alternative arrangementsMy speculation is 911s remaining competitors are going to get a major boost in the short term but a new player will eventually come along Kilmer said None of those are good replacements for LuxSocks or 911 However they will all allow anyone to use them For fraud rates the attempts will continue but through these replacement services which should be easier to monitor and stop 911 had some very clean IP addresses This entry was posted on Friday 29th of July 2022 0334 PM Could this be a case of actual hactivism I would love to see the post-mortem of what happenedCongrats again Brian keep up the good fightNone of those are good replacements for Ls or 9 However they will all allow anyone to use them For fraud rates the attempts will continue but through these replacement services which should be easier to monitor and stop 911 had some very clean IP addresses Clean IP addresses come and go all the time Like MS switching off macros makes malware go more into containers that circumvent MOTW its 6 of one half dozen of another There will be a proportional dip in overall throughput until the next crest eventually 30-90 daysPerhaps a rival gang or even a nation state did this to take over 911s infrastructure for their own purposes What happens to all the personal computers still running 911s softwareWell I do not believe the service was unrecoverable They just looked for an easy way out before things get difficult So a we were hacked all data lost not our fault sorry makes total sense They get out clean But seriously I highly doubt that they had no means in recovering the servicesExactlyWhere can we get a similar proxyHave you checked the prisonsAre you able to get any help Any similar to 911 s5Prob of future will be daily proxiesThe cost is far beyond our ability They just bailed out on us and took the easy way out nothing else I also had some credits in my account but I doubt theyll refund anyoneRefund what That which does not existThats really sad They should pay the money which they took for services they didnt provideSo they tricked people into installing malware that would add their computers to what was basically an IP address laundering ring leaving those people vulnerable to criminal charges when the companys customers use the peoples computers for cybercrime Then good riddanceI dont care if some boomer installed malware on their PC they are not going to get charged for cybercrime because someone was posting memes from 911re serviceIve noticed a SIGNIFICANT reduction in spam since these proxy services have shut downI havent gotten a spam email in 4 yearsLess volume but higher qualityMy computer has been working smoothly with less humming and heat-up for the past weekCan one be an unwilling proxyWindows was trying to install an update the entire timeIf youre using any service operated from within territory ruled by the CCP just know that its 99 likely to be SPYWARE and its also highly probable that the data was routed directly to CCP Intelligence collection services When I saw the words surreptitious install and China in the same article I knew right away what was going on MITM data harvesting opIf youre using any service operated from within territory ruled by Russia just know that its 99 likely to be MALWARE and its also highly probable that the data was routed directly to SVR Intelligence collection servicesThe problem is in knowing where things are actually operated If you know its easyAnd by easy I mean feasible maybe Not easy Wrong wordComments are closedMailing ListSearch KrebsOnSecurityRecent PostsStory CategoriesWhy So Many Top Hackers
