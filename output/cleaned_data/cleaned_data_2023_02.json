        "text": "After the Clop ransomware group claimed responsibility for the massive targeted cyberattacks that exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Fortra GoAnywhere MFT the Department of Health and Human Services is again urging entities to bolster its defenses against Clops newest tacticsIt didnt take long for Clop to claim responsibility for the attacks and alleged data exfiltration launched over the course of 10 days The group also claimed it could encrypt affected healthcare systems by deploying ransomware payloads The group has refused to validate these claimsFortra warned clients of the remote code execution vulnerability in early February and provided a workaround while it works on a patch While initially it appeared as if an actor would need access to the admin console from within a private company network a virtual private network VPN or allow-listed IPs an active exploit was released soon after the disclosure Notably prior to an emergency patch users were required to create an account to access the vulnerability report which was heavily criticized by cybersecurity experts As noted earlier Ben Krebs was the first to find details on the zero-day vulnerability and post the full alert textCybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency recently added the GoAnywhere vulnerability CVE-2023-0669 to its public catalog of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities On Feb 15 CISA ordered all federal civilian executive branch agencies to apply the patch before March 3Although these claims are uncorroborated Clop continues to exhibit a history of employing trend-setting TTPs across multiple operations according to the alert Clops alleged attack this year only further exacerbates an ever-growing trend to target the healthcare industry and highlights its vulnerabilities to future attacksThe research prompted the earlier HHS alert and an added note that Clop was designed to target Windows systems That same month SentinelLabs discovered the first Linux-based Clop variant using the same encryption method and similar process logicWhile the variant is currently flawed the latest HHS alert warned that the prevalent use of Linux in servers and cloud workloads makes it easy to suggest that Clop could employ this new ransomware campaign to target additional industries including healthcareWhats more Clop doesnt adhere to the same rules as other ransomware-as-a-service RaaS groups as it unabashedly and almost exclusively targets the healthcare sector In 2021 77 of its attacks were against healthcare That same year law enforcement arrested six members which had little impact on the groups successContinued and successful attacks however demonstrate that this prolific group is still a viable threat to the healthcare sector the alert warns The probability of cyber threat actors like Clop targeting the healthcare industry remains highHealthcare entities are being urged to review the updated alert on Clops threat to the sector which includes possible new tactics details on recent attacks and its techniques for exploiting vulnerabilities as well as possible defensive measures that could reduce the risk of exploitClop has targeted healthcare since 2019 evolving its tactics to effectively combine ransomware and data theft in novel ways said John Riggi AHAs national advisor for cybersecurity and risk in a statement Healthcare organizations should immediately apply the security patches recommended in these alerts and review the scope security and necessity of secure file transfer systemsHHS has also added additional remediation recommendations to its previous alert which include training staff on social-engineering attacks deployed via email or network access developing a cyber roadmap taught

Korea shortly after the publication of our blogpost and hit one of our YARA rules based on Wslinks unique name WinorDLL64 Regarding Wslink ESET telemetry has seen only a few detections - in Central Europe North America and the Middle EastThe WinorDLL64 payload serves as a backdoor that most notably acquires extensive system information provides means for file manipulation such as exfiltrating overwriting and removing files and executes additional commands Interestingly it communicates over a connection that was already established by the Wslink loaderIn 2021 we did not find any data that would suggest Wslink is a tool from a known threat actor However after an extensive analysis of the payload we have attributed WinorDLL64 to the Lazarus APT group with low confidence based on the targeted region and an overlap in both behavior and code with known Lazarus samplesThis blogpost explains the attribution of WinorDLL64 to Lazarus and provides an analysis of the payloadThe following

        "text": "The increased use of disk wipers in cyberattacks that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine early last year has continued unabated and the malware has transformed into a potent threat for organizations in the region and elsewhereResearchers at Fortinet recently analyzed attack data from the second half of 2022 and observed a startling 53 increase in threat actor use of disk wipers between the third and fourth quarters of the year The trajectory suggests there will be no slowing down any time soon the security vendor saidRussia-based advanced persistent threat APT groups working in support of the country's military objectives in Ukraine accounted for a lot of the initial surge in wiper use and continued activity last year However Fortinet's data shows that others including financially motivated cybercriminals hacktivist groups and other individuals fueled the increase as well especially toward the end of 2022Leading up to last year wiper activity tended to be almost nonexistent according to Geri Revay security researcher with Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs But since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine started threat actor use of the malware has exploded he saysIn 2022 alone we saw 16 different families targeted at 25 countries around the world Revay says In the second half of the year we also started seeing a new breed of wipers with some even open source and on GitHub making it much more readily available for advanced persistent cybercrime campaigns he saysCurrently the main motivation for the use of wiper malware appears to be focused around cyberwar and hacktivism Revay says But that doesn't mean threat actors won't use it in other ways like using wipers to sabotage systems or to destroy evidence of a cybercrimeMost of the wiper attacks were targeting Ukrainian organizations in 2022 but that could easily have a spillover effect on other countries Revay says As an example he points to one incident where an attack that targeted a Ukrainian satellite communication provider ended up taking 5800 German wind turbines offlineIn terms of how to prepare and how to respond to a wiper attack it is very similar to a ransomware incident Revay tells Dark Reading If the ransom is not paid which is the recommended approach a ransomware can be also considered a wiper because without the decryption key the encrypted data is as good as lostCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place London SW1P 1WG"

        "text": "Such attacks avoid directly targeting a system or hardwares defenses instead leveraging traces of the physical signals they emit such as supply current execution time or electromagnetic emissions to extract secretsMore recently the advent of deep learning-based side channel analysis has made such attacks particularly relevant for breaking encryption systems and recovering secret keys Apart from improving the effectiveness of some attacks it has also allowed for attacks on true random number generators and physical unclonable functions as well as non-differential message and secret key recovery attacks on post-quantum encryption algorithms Deep learning based side-channel attacks can overcome conventional countermeasures such as masking shuffling random delays insertion constant-weight encoding code polymorphism and randomized clock wrote researchers Elena Dubrova Kalle Ngo and Joel GrtnerEncryption algorithms rely on a technique known as masking to prevent leakage of actionable emissions and defend against side channel attacks Using a newly developed training method for neural networks the researchers discovered a way to extract message bits for high-order masked implementations with the probability above 99 They also developed a new message recovery method that manipulates ciphertexts to increase the leakage of message bits improving the rate of message recovery and eventually extracting the algorithms secret keyThere are different orders of complexity for this type of masking and previous experiments have found a way to execute successful side channel attacks against algorithms with third-order masked software implementations The method developed by KTH was successful in breaking CRYSTALS-Kyber using fifth-order implementationsTo the best of our knowledge no side-channel attack on a higher than the third order masked implementation of any LWELWR PKEKEM scheme has been demonstrated until now The presented approach is not specific for CRYSTALS-Kyber and can potentially be applied to other LWELWR PKEKEM schemes the authors wroteCRYSTALS-Kyber is one of four post-quantum algorithms selected by NIST after a rigorous multi-year vetting process to develop next generation encryption standards While the other three are meant for digital signature and identity verification CRYSTALS-Kyber is the only general purpose algorithm selected thus farHowever Dustin Moody a mathematician in NISTs computer security division told SC Media that while the agency welcomes the new research he does not believe it represents a fatal flaw in CRYSTALS-Kyber and said NIST currently has no plans to replace or deprioritize the algorithmOften encryption schemes can be tweaked or altered to account for a newly discovered flaw or experts can develop countermeasures that prevent the kind of leakage that could be used in a side channel attack Moody said that while a side channel attack can fatally kill an algorithm with this particular paper we dont feel it does that in any wayOn this particular implementation of Kyber we can use this method to break it under the circumstances in the experiment that theyre running So it breaks a particular implementation that theyre working with but it didnt break the algorithm in general he said later adding It doesnt say anything about the security of the algorithm itself It didnt exploit some flaw or design weakness to show that youll be able to attack it more generallyThose thoughts were echoed by Ali El Kaafarani CEO of PQShield which makes and sells quantum-resistant technologies The paper appears to highlight a valid side channel attack method but not one necessarily specific to CRYSTALS-Kyber and it doesn't unearth any new fundamental weaknesses in the algorithm or its underlying mathematicsIt's important to understand the difference between an algorithm and its potentially many different implementations Any algorithm can and will inevitably have many non-securebroken implementations this doesnt mean that the algorithm itself is broken otherwise people wouldnt still be using RSAECC now El Kaafarani saidStill such adjustments do come with real tradeoffs The algorithms selected by NIST were done in part based on their efficiency Every new protection added to account for side channel leakage slows down its performanceFor CRYSTALS-Kyberwe asked the cryptographic community to do a lot of work here and in the second and third rounds of our process research seemed to show that to protect Kyber pretty well it would be about twice as slow when you added on lots of countermeasures to protect it from side channel attacks said MoodyDerek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors Prior to that he was a senior reporter covering cybersecurity policy at Federal Computer Week Derek

        "text": "Many of Russias cyber operations against Ukraine and NATO members during the past year have not yet become public knowledge according to a joint report published this week by two Dutch intelligence servicesThe fact that the pace of Russian cyber operations is fast is a big factor the report said And the nature of many targeted institutions such as military and diplomatic agencies leads to secrecy about their vulnerabilitiesBefore and during the war Russian intelligence and security services engaged in widespread digital espionage sabotage and influencing against Ukraine and NATO allies says the report which describes the full-blown invasion of Ukraine a year ago this week as a turning point in historyRussias target selection has been very broad the agencies said meaning that even Ukrainian organizations that are not playing a direct role in the course of the war or political decision-making are being hackedThe joint report relays the findings of the intelligence agencies collected through sensitive operations using human and technical resources about the threat posed by the Russian state conducting cyberattacks on various institutions physical sabotage on maritime infrastructure and information operationsRussian threat Western responseThe impact of continued Russian attack attempts in cyberspace has been limited thanks to Ukrainian and Western digital defenses the joint report said adding that Russia has found it difficult to synchronize cyber operations with other military operations such as airstrikesThe largest part of Russian cyber operations were espionage activities aimed at accessing military diplomatic and economic information from both Ukraine and NATO allies said the intelligence agencies The targets include tactical intelligence such as the locations of military equipment and personnelNATO members who are providing military support to Ukraine also are common targets of Russian intelligence The joint report said that the Dutch armed forces ministries and embassies have also been the target of unsuccessful cyber espionage attempts in the past yearMoscow regularly attempts to digitally sabotage Ukrainian vital infrastructure and carries out constant wiper malware attacks The sustained and very high pressure that Russia exerts with this requires constant vigilance from Ukrainian and Western defenders said the joint reportDespite this large-scale disruption has so far failed to materialize and the impact of cyber sabotage is dwarfed by the impact of physical military operationsThe potential of cyber operations cannot be fully exploited by Russia the intelligence agencies added without providing too much of an explanation But the report said most Russian digital attack attempts are detected prematurely or remedied quickly thanks to far-reaching Ukrainian monitoring detection and response measures Ukraine receives significant help from for example Western intelligence services and companiesThe two agencies warned that the Ukrainian defense was not guaranteed and can probably only be sustained as long as Western support remains as intensive and adaptive as the cyber operations of the Russian intelligence servicesPhysical sabotage threatThe Dutch infrastructure in the North Sea includes internet cables gas pipelines and wind farms which the intelligence agencies warned can be vulnerable to sabotage the report said Russian ships also have been covertly mapping the Netherlands maritime infrastructure and undertaking activities that indicate espionage and preparatory acts for disruption and sabotageFor example a Russian ship was detected at an offshore windfarm according to the MIVD's chief Gen Jan Swillens Dutch coast guard ships escorted the vessel out of the North Sea said Swillens who added that the Russian reconnaissance of the North Sea energy system is something the MIVD hadn't seen beforeThe report did not mention the suspected sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines which run through the Baltic SeaHowever the agencies added it was conceivable that Russia could seek to cause a similar physical threat to other vital sectors such as drinking water and energy supply is also conceivable as long as such attacks can be carried out covertlyInformation operationsRussias intelligence services have succeeded several times in temporarily taking control of Ukrainian media broadcasts and broadcasting Russian messages said the report Subsequently the systems of these media were digitally sabotagedOther incidents such as malware aimed at disrupting Ukraines power supply are probably mainly aimed at undermining Ukrainian morale rather than achieving a military objective the Dutch agencies saidTo hide their involvement in covertly spreading disinformation and propaganda through digital channels Russian intelligence services employ many techniques they also use for cyber operations the intelligence services warnedThey added that in the case of the information operations troops within the Russian military intelligence service GRU it was even partly the same units that are responsible for both cyber operations and covert influenceAlexander Martin is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News He was previously a technology reporter for Sky News and is also a fellow at the European Cyber Conflict

        "text": "Tech News and AnalysisA newly created artificial intelligence AI system based on deep reinforcement learning DRL can react to attackers in a simulated environment and block 95 of cyberattacks before they escalateThat's according to the researchers from the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory PNNL who built an abstract simulation of the digital conflict between attackers and defenders in a network and trained four different DRL neural networks to maximize rewards based on preventing compromises and minimizing network disruptionThe successful training of the AI system on the simplified attack environment demonstrates that defensive responses to attacks in real time could be handled by an AI model says Samrat Chatterjee a data scientist who presented the team's work at last week's annual meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington DCYou don't want to move into more complex architectures if you cannot even show the promise of these techniques he says We wanted to first demonstrate that we can actually train a DRL successfully and show some good testing outcomes before moving forwardYet creating an AI system capable of proactive defense continues to be an aspirational rather than practical goal While a variety of hurdles remain for researchers the PNNL research shows that an AI defender could be possible in the futureThe goals of the attacker agents are to move through the seven steps of the attack chain from initial access to execution from persistence to command and control and from collection to impactFor the attacker adapting their tactics to the state of the environment and the defender's current actions can be complex says PNNL's ChatterjeeThe adversary has to navigate their way from an initial recon state all the way to some exfiltration or impact state he says We're not trying to create a kind of model to stop an adversary before they get inside the environment we assume that the system is already compromisedThe researchers used four approaches to neural networks based on reinforcement learning RL which is an ML approach that emulates the reward system of the human brain A neural network learns by strengthening or weakening certain parameters for individual neurons to reward better solutions as measured by a score indicating how well the system performsRL essentially allows the computer to create a good but not perfect approach to the problem at hand says Mahantesh Halappanavar a PNNL researcher and an author of the paperWithout using any reinforcement learning we could still do it but it would be a really big problem that will not have enough time to actually come up with any good mechanism he says Our research gives us this mechanism where deep reinforcement learning is sort of mimicking some of the human behavior itself to some extent and it can explore this very vast space very efficientlyAmong the many problems that remain to be solved is getting RL and deep neural networks to explain the factors that influenced their decisions an area of research called explainable reinforcement learning XRLIn addition the robustness of the AI algorithms and finding efficient ways of training the neural networks are both problems that need to be solved says PNNL's ChatterjeeCreating a product that was not the main motivation for this research he says This was more about scientific experimentation and algorithmic discoveryCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place London SW1P 1WG"

attributed to the advanced persistent threat actor known as Earth Kitsune which we have covered before Since 2019 Earth Kitsune has been distributing variants of self-developed backdoors to targets primarily individuals who are interested in North KoreaBy Joseph C Chen Jaromir HorejsiFebruary 17 2023Read time wordsSave to FolioAt the end of 2022 we discovered that the website of a pro-North Korean organization was compromised and modified to distribute malware When a targeted visitor tries to watch videos on the website a malicious script injected by the attacker displays a message prompt notifying the victims with a video codec error to entice them to download and install a trojanized codec installer The installer was patched to load a previously unseen backdoor that we dubbed WhiskerSpy In addition we also found the threat actor adopting an interesting persistence technique that abuses Google Chromes native messaging hostIn this blog post we are going to reveal the infection chain and technical details of the WhiskerSpy backdoor employed by Earth KitsuneAt the end of 2022 we noticed that a pro-North Korean website had a malicious script injected in their video pages The script showed a popup window with a fake error message designed to entice victims to install a malicious package disguised as an Advanced Video Codec - AVC1The webpages were configured to deliver the malicious script only to visitors from a list of targeted IP addresses visitors that did not have these IP addresses would not receive the malicious payload This configuration makes the attack difficult to discover Fortunately we managed to find a text file on the threat actors server containing a regular expression matching the targeted IP addresses These includeThe IP addresses in Shenyang and Nagoya are likely to be their real targets However we found the targeted IP addresses in Brazil mostly belonged to a commercial VPN service We believe that the threat actor used this VPN service to test the deployment of their watering hole attacks It also provided us with an opportunity to verify the watering hole attack by using the same VPN service to successfully receive the malicious scriptThe website loads a malicious JavaScript popupjs with the following redirection codeThe entry point of the patched installer is changed to immediately jump to the shellcode The shellcode is encrypted with a simple key XOR 0x01After decryption the shellcode runs several PowerShell commands to download additional stages of malware These files are executable files with a few hundred bytes from the beginning XORed with one-byte keyIt then restores the original entry point 15 bytes in total to ensure that the original installer runs as expectedThis contains the path microsoftonedrivevcruntime140dll which is the location where another downloaded file bgjpg gets dropped under the name vcruntime140dllThis is a patched version of vcruntime140dll Microsoft C Runtime library In this instance the function memset was patched as seen in Figures 10 and 11 The return from function retn was replaced with a jump to overlay in the newly adde odata section where an injected code reads bytes from the overlay XORs them with a 1-byte key and injects the embedded payload into the werfautlexe process The shellcode in the overlay is a loader of the main backdoorThis is an installer package that contains Installerexe a Google Chrome extension installer NativeAppexe a native messaging host and Chrome extension files backgroundjs manifestjson and iconpngThe format of the message is as follows xx xx xx xx cmddata where xx xx xx xx is length of the message in bytes The cmd key must contain one of the implemented command values execute load and inject while the data key may contain additional parameters like path and the program to be executedThe following are examples of valid JSON messagescmdexecutedatacwindowssystem32notepadexecmdloaddatactemphello-world-x64dllMessageBoxThreadcmdinjectdatapowershell Get-Content cmdbin -raw NativeAppexeIn the current implementation the inject command has no parameters Instead it connects to the hardcoded URL address httpdelivery serverhelpjpg downloads decodes and runs the main payload which is a backdoorThis is a shellcode that loads another embedded executable the main backdoor payload which we named WhiskerSpyWhiskerSpy uses elliptic-curve cryptography ECC to exchange encryption keys between the client and server The following are the implemented backdoor commandsThere is one more value shown in Figure 16 brown color which represents the hardcoded servers public keyCC communication begins by registering the machine ID function number 3 POST request with lmachineIDThe uploading of the 64-byte file with the x-coordinate of the client public key and the encrypted AES key follows function number 1 POST request with lmachineIDsessionIDWhiskerSpy then periodically requests the CC server for any tasks it should perform function number 2 POST request with hmachineIDWhiskerSpy implements standard functions While analyzing the code we noticed a few status codes designed to report the state of the task with the first words two bytes of the received message being the command ID Note that in the case of the command packet the magic value is the same for all commands it is found before the command ID and is not displayed in Table 2 In the case of the alive packet the first word 2 bytes of the magic value is used as the command ID therefore the 0x70D value can be found in the tableOlder versions of WhiskerSpy are 32-bit executables and implement only subsets of the previously mentioned functions 1-580x70D are the same 6 exit process 7 drop file to temp and execute it The remaining functions are missingThe communication is not via HTTP protocol but via FTP protocol This means that the FTP name and password must be hardcoded in the binary to enable communication This approach leaks the current number of victims as lmachineIDsessionID and hmachineID files that are visible to anyone who knows the login credentialsThe FTP version of the backdoor also checks for the presence of the debugger If present the status code HELO is sent to the CC serverThis threat is very interesting from a technical perspective It patches the legitimate installers to hide its activities uses lesser-known hashing algorithms to compute machine IDs and session IDs and employs ECC to protect encryption keys In addition the presented methods of persistence are also quite unique and rare This shows that Earth Kitsune are proficient with their technical abilities and are continuously evolving their tools

        "text": "By Aleksandar Milenkoski Collin Farr and Joey Chen in collaboration with QGroupThe WIP26 activity is initiated by precision targeting of employees through WhatsApp messages that contain Dropbox links to a malware loader Tricking employees into downloading and executing the loader ultimately leads to the deployment of backdoors that leverage Microsoft 365 Mail and Google Firebase instances as C2 servers We refer to these backdoors as CMD365 and CMDEmber respectively The main functionality of CMD365 and CMDEmber is to execute attacker-provided system commands using the Windows command interpreterThe use of public Cloud infrastructure for C2 purposes is an attempt to make malicious C2 network traffic look legitimate and therefore make detection harder for defenders The CMD365 and CMDEmber samples we observed masquerade as utility software such as a PDF editor or browser and as software that conducts update operations The masquerading attempt involves the use of filenames application icons and digital signatures that indicate existing software vendorsThis report provides details on the WIP26 threat activity and further context around the use of CMD365 and CMDEmberThe PDFelementexe malware loader has an invalid digital signature that indicates the vendor of the PDFelement application WondershareThe loader deploys the CMD365 backdoor a NET executable named Updateexe and creates a scheduled task named MicrosoftUpdatesA that executes CMD365 at system startup for persistenceThe main functionality of CMD365 is to execute commands from a C2 hosted on a Microsoft 365 Mail instance This capability was used to conduct a variety of activities such as reconnaissance privilege escalation staging of additional malware and data exfiltrationThe exfiltrated data included users private browser data and reconnaissance information on particular high-value hosts in the victims network This is a typical precursor to the subsequent targeting of these hosts The data exfiltration was orchestrated through the execution of PowerShell commands to transport key data to Microsoft Azure instances The threat actor behind WIP26 used the Windows Azure website socialmsdnmicrosoftazurewebsitesnet as a malware hosting site and akamazurewebsitesnet as a data exfiltration siteThe figure below gives an overview of the Cloud infrastructure the threat actor behind WIP26 used for initial infection and as C2 servers and exfiltration and malware hosting sites We informed Google Microsoft and Dropbox about the abuse of their infrastructureThe core feature of CMD365 is to execute attacker-provided system commands as standard input to an instance of the Windows command interpreterCMD365 issues an HTTP POST request to loginmicrosoftonlinecom to authenticate itself to a Microsoft 365 Mail inbox using valid credentials that are hardcoded in the malware The malware then receives an OAuth Bearer access token that it uses in the further interaction with Microsoft 365CMD365 then creates an inbox folder with a name that is unique for each infected machine The name is a combination of the physical address of the main active network interface on the machine the machines computer name and the name of the user in whose context the malware executes CMD365 collects this information when it starts executingCMD365 polls the inbox folder for C2 commands by querying for emails whose subjects start with the keyword Input These emails contain C2 input intended for processing by CMD365 on infected machinesThe C2 server and CMD365 exchange encrypted and Base64-encoded data For data encryption and decryption the malware uses the AES key Xc4u7xADG-KaPdSr56tp2s5v8yB in string format and an empty initialization vector IVAs with CMD365 the core feature of CMDEmber is to execute system commands using the Windows command interpreterWhen executed CMDEmber connects to the Firebase instance httpsgmall-52fb5-default-rtdbasia-southeast1firebasedatabaseapp or httpsgo0gle-service-default-rtdbfirebaseiocom and then exfiltrates information about the infected machine The exfiltrated data includes some of the information that the CMDEmber collects the computer name the bitness name and ID of the CMDEmber process the name of the user in whose context CMDEmber executes and the IPv4 and physical addresses of all operational network interfaces on the infected machineCMDEmber uses the MD5 hash of the Triple DES key Mgirdhgi256HIKnuefsdfdfgsdfkjsrht in string format to encrypt and decrypt the Base64 data exchanged with the C2CMDEmber sends and receives data from the C2 server by issuing HTTP POST and GET requests respectively The URL paths of these requests contain a unique identifier of each infected machine which is a combination of the ID and bitness of the CMDEmber process and the physical addresses of the operational network interfaces at the victim machineAfter exfiltrating information about the infected machine CMDEmber polls the Firebase instance for C2 commands by issuing HTTP GET requests that include the identifier of the infected machineThe data that the C2 server and CMDEmber exchange is in JSON format The Firebase C2 server stores exchanged data with all infected machines in a JSON-formatted file such that the nodes are the unique identifiers of the machinesWe assess it is likely this activity is espionage-related We track this activity as WIP26 the Work-In-Progress WIPxx designation is used for unattributed activity clustersThe initial intrusion vector we observed involved precision targeting The threat actor sent WhatsApp messages to targets with download links to backdoor malware Further the targeting of telecommunication providers in the Middle East suggests the motive behind this activity is espionage-related Communication providers are frequent targets of espionage activity due to the sensitive data they hold Finally evidence suggests that once they established a foothold the threat actor targeted users private information and specific networked hosts of high valueThe threat actor behind WIP26 activity appears to have made some OPSEC errors For example the JSON file where the Google Firebase C2 server stores data exchanged with machines infected by CMDEmber is publicly accessible at the time of writing providing further insights into the WIP26 activityThe use of public Cloud infrastructure by APT groups is not unheard of These threat actors continue to innovate in order to stay stealthy This includes leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for C2 purposes to blend in and make the detection of C2 traffic harder for defendersThe WIP26 activity is a relevant example of threat actors continuously innovating their TTPs in an attempt to stay stealthy and circumvent defenses The use of public Cloud infrastructure for malware hosting data exfiltration and C2 purposes aims at making malicious traffic look legitimate This gives attackers the opportunity to conduct their activities unnoticed We hope that this report helps to emphasize this tactic in the continuous effort to identify threat groups engaged in targeting critical industriesSentinelLabs continues to track the WIP26 threat cluster to provide further insight into its evolution future activity and attributionGet notified when we post new contentThanks Keep an eye out for new contentIn the era of interconnectivity when markets geographies and jurisdictions merge in the melting pot of the digital domain the perils of the threat ecosystem become unparalleled Crimeware families achieve an

        "text": "Key findingsIn this report we provide a full technical analysis of the OxtaRAT as well as its capabilities and evolution over the years We also discuss the tactics techniques and procedures TTPs of the threat actors complete with an overview of their activity throughout the yearsThe Republic of Artsakh also known as theNagorno-Karabakh Republic is a breakaway region in the South Caucasus with a majority ethnic Armenian population but is recognized internationally as part of Azerbaijan It is a de facto enclave within Azerbaijan with the only land route toArmenia through the Lachin corridor which has been under the control of Russian peacekeepers since the end of theSecond Nagorno-Karabakh War in 2020The situation in Artsakh is tense with frequent ceasefire violations and sporadic outbreaks of violence For more than two decades this unresolved highly militarized ethno-nationalist territorial conflict continues to be a source of tension between Armenia and AzerbaijanA malicious file named IsraeliNGOthanksArtsakhbankforthesupportofscr was submitted to VirusTotal VT on November 29 2022 from an IP address located in Yerevan ArmeniaIt is a self-extracting archive that masquerades as a PDF file and bears a PDF icon Upon execution it drops to the Temp folder of the infected device and executes a self-extracting cab called AlexanderLapshinEXE This in turn drops multiple additional files and executes one of them the execbat script In its deobfuscated form this script is very shortAlexander Lapshin a Russian-Israeli travel blogger journalist and human rights activist was detained in Belarus in 2016 and extradited to Azerbaijan He was sentenced to 3 years in prison for illegally crossing the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan without authorization from the Azerbaijani authorities in 2011 and 2012 while visiting Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia Nine months into his detention in September 2017 Lapshin was attacked in a solitary confinement cell of a Baku pre-trial detention center The attack was publicly declared by Azerbaijani officials to be a suicide attempt Afterward he was pardoned by the Azerbaijani President and deported to IsraelAs we mentioned previously AutoITexe is used to run code from an image called iconpng This is a polyglot malware combining valid JPEG and AutoIT A3X file formatsAutoIT is a legitimate tool that is used by many IT administrators to automate tasks but is frequently abused by threat actors In this case the actors use a fully functional backdoor containing approximately 20000 lines of obfuscated AutoIt codeThe backdoor which we call OxtaRAT contains a variety of capabilities typically associated with espionage activity It contains commands that allow the attackers toThe backdoor starts by first setting up its base folder moving the iconpng file there and adding a persistence mechanism to run it every 2 minutes with AutoIt3exe via a scheduled task named WallPaperChangeApp It also creates a working folder to store the results and logs of each command execution and sets hidden and system attributes for both base and working folders to conceal them from being easily discovered and arouse suspicion It also downloads the legitimate curl executable and DLL which are later used for some types of CC communicationThe CC server for this sample is edupoliceaminfo a lookalike for the domain of the Police Education Complex of Police of the Republic of ArmeniaNext the malware enters the main infinite loop where in each step it performs the following actionsMost of the capabilities require additional files mostly legitimate to be downloaded during the malware execution from the path on the server requirementupbinThe only next-stage tool that wasnt available on the server was AppCrashCollectorexe whose download and execution are triggered by the implant command We assume that this is the payload that the actors attempt to hide from researchers and deliver to important targets only after additional checks are performed on the infected machineThe communication between the malware and its CC server is based on clear text commands the arguments for each command are separated by the signThe full list of commands supported by the backdoorFor the commands that require output the final command line that was executed and its output are written to the working directory to the file with Random1 815782 -command-txt nameAlthough not widely discussed previous versions of the OxtaRAT backdoor were used in earlier attacks against Azerbaijani political and human rights activists or when the targets were not disclosed publicly their lures referenced Azerbaijan-Armenia tensions around Artsakh The older versions of OxtaRAT have significantly less functionality than the new variant but contain similar code and names for most of the commands and the same CC communication patternIn August 2021 another sample was observed this time submitted to VirusTotal from Armenia The file called REPORTONTHEAZERBAIJANIMILLITARYAGRESSION Final Updated 2021scr also bears the PDF icon and when executed presents the victim with the following PDF lureIn the background it downloads the main malware from the CC server httpswwwfilecloudservicesxyzwp-commentphp and saves it as PhoneAppServiceExe The code of this version implements the same string obfuscation as the newest versionIn the background it downloaded from the CC server httpssmartappsfoursixxyzwp-feedphp and run another version of OxtaRAT This is a more advanced version compared to the 2021 attacks with many additional commands added 29 in totalThe version from June 2021 was capable only of downloading and exfiltrating files executing the binaries and AutoIT code and recording data from the desktop and web camera In contrast the version observed in February 2022 is a more powerful malware with a lot of additional features The actors added capabilities to improve local file enumeration list files on the desktop search for specific files collect data about the compromised system work with zip files and most importantly improved the ways they can access and control the infected machine by adding commands to install TightVNC or the PHP web serverThe first change that the actors implemented in their latest attack is in the infection chain Previously the initial SCR files masquerading as Word or PDF documents served only as downloaders They sent a request to WordPress-like URLs on the CC server wp-feedphp wp-commentphp etc and then executed the main malware received from the attackers server In the latest campaign the SCR file already contains the OxtaRAT backdoor as a polyglot file This saves the actors from needing to make additional requests for binaries to the CC server and attracting unnecessary attention as well as hides the main malware from being easily discovered on the infected machine as it looks like a regular image and bypasses type-specific protections The actors added an additional measure to protect their infrastructure geofencing the CC domains that store the auxiliary tools and additional payloads This is a technique currently used by many experienced threat actors to make sure that the proper execution flow is not triggered by sandboxes or researchers but only on the targeted machines In this case the actors limited their operations to Armenian IP addressesSince the previous publicly disclosed version OxtaRAT was updated with 10 additional commands introducing new functionality Most of the new features aim to improve the ways to steal the victims data For example they implemented the listdir command to recursively enumerate the files in a specified folder collecting additional data such as the last modified date and size The previously existing command massdownload which is used to exfiltrate files of predefined types was also updated with a few new file extensions marked in boldmdbaccdbrdooraaccdaaccdraccdtpptavipptxodtpdftxtmsfdocxxmldocrtfjpgjpegpngxlsxlsxrdpziprarsqlsqlitephpavimp4tartargz7zbz2tarbz2As can be seen from this snippet the actors are now interested in additional file types related to Oracle and Microsoft Access databases This is an interesting development as it indicates they may be broadening their targets to include corporate networks or specific individuals as common private computers rarely contain personal files in DB formatsThe actors also implemented advanced mass-download commands such as the massdownload2 and massdownload2list that allow the actors to enumerate and exfiltrate specified filetypes more conveniently In addition they implemented functions to work with RAR archives installrar rarit unrarit which along with the clear benefits of uploading the auxiliary tools inside RAR archives to the infected machines enable the actors to archive all the files of their interest to the multi-volume RAR archive The default list of extensions provided in the code of the rarit exfiltration function shows a focus on documents pictures archives and databasesAnother interesting feature included in the most recent version is the speedtest command which invokes Speedtest CLI a dedicated tool to test the speed and performance of an internet connection As the malware is not only capable of collecting a large quantity of files but also recording video from a web camera and screen it can produce significantly large outputs with gigabytes of data Therefore for the sake of OPSEC to hide the extensive data exfiltration the actors likely needed a way to control and estimate the upload all of the collected information to their serversThe last feature added to the data collection mechanism is a proclist command which uses WMIC to retrieve the command line for each of the processes This feature might be used for evasion purposes so the actors can make sure they are running in an actual environment as opposed to a sandbox as well as to learn more about the software configurations running on the victims machineOne of the unexpected features that we found during this investigation is the portscan tool which is included only in the newer version of the backdoor The port scanner pscclientexe is an Auto-IT based non-obfuscated TCP Connect tool that can scan a specified range of IP addresses and a range of ports The default range of ports configured in the tool includes both well-known and non-standard portsOxtaRAT which previously had mostly local recon and surveillance capabilities can now be used as a pivot for active reconnaissance of other devices This may indicate that the threat actors are preparing to extend their main attack vector which is currently social engineering to infrastructure-based attacks It also might be a sign that the actors are moving from targeting individuals to targeting more complex or corporate environmentsOur search for domains with similar characteristics to edupoliceaminfo led to more active domains filesindriveinfo mediacloudspace and avvpassportinfo All the domains are registered with NameCheap While filesindriveinfo and mediacloudspace similar to filecloudservicesxyz used in back in 2021 have a generic reference to cloud file storages the domain avvpassportinfo is more specific and it masquerades as the Passport and Visa Office of the Republic of Armenia Both of these domains edupoliceaminfo and avvpassportinfo were created on September 23 2022 and were likely also used for other attacks on Armenian targetsAt the beginning of our investigation all of these domains used Cloudflare services to hide their IP addresses Due to their configuration by looking for IP addresses with the same behavior we identified 38242197156 as likely their real IP address While we were completing the investigation and notifying the relevant parties Cloudflare blocked these domains as malicious and they all started to publicly resolve to their real IP address 38242197156Even though we couldnt find any infrastructure overlap with our campaign considering a gap of a few years and public exposure of previous attacks there is a significant overlap in major TTPsAlthough it is tricky to compare the code of tools with different functionality keylogger compared to a full-blown surveillance tool there are a few high-level overlaps in the coding style of these toolsBased on these similarities in TTPs code and targeting we can conclude with medium confidence that both cases involve the same threat actors We can also speculate that the missing implant in OxtaRAT that we were unable to access might be a keylogger not only is it an important functionality missing from OxtaRATs multi-functional surveillance arsenal but also the actors might take extra measures to avoid revealing it to anyone except the targets possibly to avoid attribution based on already uncovered informationIn this article we describe the latest attack and the evolution of the tools in the campaigns against Armenian targets as well as Azerbaijani activists and dissidents All the details indicate that the underlying threat actors have been maintaining the development of Auto-IT based malware for the last seven years and are using it in surveillance campaigns whose targets are consistent with Azerbaijani interestsCheck Point

employee's valid credentials to pivot and access the Atlassian employee directory and office floor plans held within Envoys app the spokesperson wroteIn an update Friday an Envoy representative told SC Media they found log evidence of requests confirming that hackers obtained valid user credentials from an Atlassian employee account and used that access to download the affected data from Envoys appThe representative also claimed no other customer data was stolenAn Atlassian's representative also reached out to confirm that the leak began with compromised credentialsWe learned the hacking group compromised Atlassian data from the Envoy app using an Atlassian employees credentials that had been mistakenly posted in a public repository by the employee As such the hacking group had access to data visible via the employee account which included the published office floor plans and public Envoy profiles of other Atlassian employees and contractors the spokesperson wrote The compromised employees account was promptly disabled early in the investigation which was proven effective in eliminating any further threat to Atlassians Envoy data Atlassian product and customer data is not accessible via the Envoy app and therefore not at riskEarlier this week a hacking group calling itself SiegedSec began posting on Telegram that they had compromised Atlassian's network and leaked employee data in a Valentines Day-themed note claiming to have obtained email addresses phone numbers and names of employees as well as a lot moreSiegedSec is here to announce we have hacked the software company Atlassian the hackers wrote according to a screenshot obtained by SC Media This company worth 44 billion has been pwned by the furry hackers uwuWe are leaking thousands of employee records as well as a few building floorplans These employee records contain email addresses phone numbers names and lots moreHowever independent researchers corroborated some of Atlassians claims including their core contention that the data leaked online does not appear to have been taken directly from Atlassian systemsCheck Point researchers told SC Media the files and blueprints involved are consistent with the type of third-party data that Envoy would have stored and were stamped with Envoys logo Lending further credence to the idea despite claiming to have hacked directly into Atlassians systems SiegedSec did not leak any other types of dataThe data leaked does not appear to be particularly valuable and researchers at Check Point said it's not clear whether SiegedSec's

        "title": "Russian APT Gamaredon Exploits Hoaxshell to Target Ukrainian Organizations by Gianluca Tiepolo Medium",
        "text": "--ListenShareResearch by Gianluca Tiepolo and Rmi ArseneGamaredon is a Russian state-sponsored hacking group that has been active since at least 2013 The group is believed to be responsible for a number of cyber attacks against Ukrainian targets including military government and critical infrastructure organizations The Security Service of Ukraine classifies the group as an APT Advanced Persistent Threat and unambiguously identifies it as a specially created structural unit of the Federal Security Service FSB of the Russian Federation whose tasks are intelligence and subversive activities against Ukraine in cyberspaceGamaredon is also known as Primitive Bear CrowdStrike Winterflouder iDefence BlueAlpha Recorded Future BlueOtso PWC IronTiden SecureWorks SectorC08 Red Alert Callisto NATO Association of Canada Shuckworm and Armageddon CERT-UAThe groups tactics techniques and procedures TTPs have been well documented and often involve the use of social engineering spear-phishing and malware including backdoors and information stealers The ultimate goal of the group is thought to be to gather intelligence and disrupt Ukrainian operationsFollowing is a list of successful attacks attributed to the Gamaredon group over the yearsThe campaign part of an ongoing espionage operation observed as recently as February 2023 aims to deliver malware to Ukrainian victim machines and makes heavy use of obfuscated PowerShell and VBScript VBS scripts as part of the infection chain The malware is a WebShell that includes capabilities for executing remote commands from an attacker and deploying additional binary and script-based payloads on an infected machineThe attack vector consists of a spear-phishing email with minimal body content along with an attachment Once the attachment is opened by the victim the system will be compromised through the installation of a WebShell Like in their prior operations Gamaredon relies on the highly targeted distribution of weaponized documents Their deceptive lures imitate official documents from real Ukrainian government organizations meticulously crafted to deceive individuals who have legitimate reasons to interact with those organizationsSeveral types of attachments were used to deliver malware Some examples include xlsx doc xlsm and docm of which docm was the most prevalent The text of one such decoy document is pictured belowAs an example the document with the filename defiantdocm employs a macro in order to gain initial access Once the malicious document is opened it executes the next stage of the attack chainThe naming convention of the malicious documents in this campaign follows a similar patternThis is consistent with other campaigns by Gamaredon where malicious files are made up of a word beginning with the letter d and a few are composed of two words separated by a -Once opened the Word document will execute a heavily obfuscated macro called xdm This PowerShell script decodes and executes a second PowerShell script also obfuscated which reports back to the command and control serverThis script which is the actual WebShell also allows the remote server to send a PowerShell command to be executed locallyThe first layer of obfuscation is achieved by reversing the Base64-encoded payloadOnce the first payload has been decoded the malware reveals a second layer of obfuscation which is achieved through a number of techniques such as string encoding command and argument obfuscation variable renaming and code packingApplying multiple obfuscation techniques can help threat actors evade signature-based detection systems which rely on identifying specific patterns of code that are associated with known malicious activities Once the second layer of obfuscation has been defeated the code begins to be a lot more readableAfter a bit of cleaning and parsing I obtained the following payloadThe malicious payload creates a number of variables by performing string operations and replacements on several hardcoded strings The resulting values are then used in several Invoke-WebRequest commands to make HTTP requests to the CC server specified by the variablesLets go through the code step-by-step The script starts by defining three variablesNext the script invokes a REST method using Invoke-RestMethod with the URL ps17e9c023envCOMPUTERNAMEenvUSERNAME and an HTTP header containing the authorization string i The result of this method is stored in the v variableThe script then enters a loop that runs indefinitely In each iteration the script invokes another REST method using Invoke-RestMethod with the URL ps7c9d6f61 and an HTTP header containing the authorization string i The result of this method which is the command received from the CC server is stored in the c variableThe server response is then parsed to see if there are commands to be executed if c is not equal to the string None there is a new command from the CC server so the script uses Invoke-Expression to run the content of c as a PowerShell command and stores the output in the r variable The script then invokes another REST method using Invoke-RestMethod with the URL ps48eb357e an HTTP header containing the authorization string i and a body containing the output of the previous command concatenated with the contents of the e variable which holds any error messages generated by the Invoke-Expression commandFinally the script uses the Sleep cmdlet to wait for 08 seconds before repeating the loopThe script is executed using the powershell executable with the -command option and an -ArgumentList parameter that contains the script in a PowerShell script block The -WindowStyle option is set to Hidden which means that the PowerShell window will run in the background without being displayedThis is not the only sample I came across in a variant of the infected Word document the address of the command and control server was requested from a hardcoded Telegram account with each account periodically deploying new IP addresses Once the IP address is obtained it is used to assemble the previously analyzed payloadFetching IP addresses from Telegram accounts is a technique that has been associated to Gamaredon group in a number of campaigns including latest research by BlackBerry However the thing that really caught my attention was the PowerShell payload it was intriguing to find out that it contains an authorization string such as 17e9c023-7c9d6f61-48eb357e which is passed to the CC through a header and this string is different for each target This suggests that Gamaredon is attacking its victims through some highly targeted attacksThe other thing I noticed in Gamaredons payload is a great similarity with the following codeThe main file used to generate the payload is written in Python while the WebShells actual code is pure PowerShellOne of the reasons why the project gained traction is that it includes built-in obfuscation techniques and it performs so well against systems running AV solutions without being detectedThis is probably the reason why Gamaredon group abused the project in this campaign in fact the Word document with the malicious payload based on Hoaxshell with a few tweaks added by Gamaredon was able to completely bypass some of the most popular AV solutions including Microsoft Defender Kaspersky McAfee and SentinelOneThe fact that Gamaredon exploited an open-source project like Hoaxshell doesnt exactly come as a surprise the group has been observed using widely-available tools such as the Remote Access Trojan RAT called njRAT the remote desktop tool UltraVNC and the network scanner Masscan These off-the-shelf tools provide the group with basic functionality such as the ability to remotely control compromised systems or scan for vulnerable targetsIn addition to off-the-shelf tools the group is also known to develop custom tools and malware to carry out specific attacks For example the group has been observed using custom-developed backdoors such as Pterodo and BlackEnergy to gain access to target systems and to maintain persistence within a networkThe use of both off-the-shelf and custom-developed tools allows the Gamaredon group to carry out effective and efficient attacks while also making it harder for defenders to detect and respond to their activityIn this particular campaign once Gamaredon gained an initial foothold through the malicious Word document the group was observed running reconnaissance commands and deploying the Pterodo backdoor to maintain persistenceOnce the group obtained persistence on the target the attackers proceed to download another variant of their Pterodo backdoor and begin running additional scripts and creating scheduled tasks to run every few minutesLater a new file called deerskinexe was downloaded by exploiting the Hoaxshell shell when executed it checks internet connectivity then proceeds to drop a VNC client UltraVNC and establishes a connection to Gamaredons remote CC serverThe analysis of this campaign has revealed a number of patterns which can be useful for detection opportunitiesFor detection purposes I have written a simple SIGMA rule which matches Gamaredons malicious payloadGamaredon has been changing infrastructure over time however its worth noting that the tools used by the group while not particularly sophisticated in terms of architecture and implementation complexity have still been highly effective in carrying out their criminal activities Its also worth mentioning that the group has not shown much interest in lateral movement within the network instead relying on their tactics techniques and procedures TTPs to compromise a large number of individual user systems through targeted delivery of malwareAs previously mentioned Gamaredon employs open-source tools to distribute their malware which are typically delivered through spear-phishing emails When the victim receives the malicious email they are sent an attachment in Word or Excel format which contains the malware At the final stage of the attack the group deploys remote access software and information-gathering toolsThe Gamaredon group exclusively used Russian telecommunication providers to deploy their command and control servers in this campaign with most of them being provided by IP Server LLC Hosting technology LTD TimeWeb LLC and SprintHost LLCRUAttribution of Gamaredon to this campaign was possible by matching known TTPs and infrastructure analysis A full list of IOCs is provided belowDespite being publicly exposed multiple times the Gamaredon group persists in utilizing the same simplistic techniques often relying on readily available tools such as Hoaxshell and heavy obfuscation and even reusing code in new attacksDespite this the group has achieved notable success in their operations and continues to pose a significant cyber threat to Ukraine The groups attack chain is characterized by the widespread use of weaponized Office documents Office template injection WMI and dynamic VBA macro stages making it highly malleable and adaptableGiven the groups specific focus on Ukrainian organizations and the current geopolitical climate its highly likely that Gamaredon will continue to target this regionFollowing is a list of indicators associated to this campaignDomainshxxpf0559838xsphruhxxpa0728173xsphruIPs1418197421418192151SHA256 2AD5A546EAE0FEABADD0D4416EB03CBDA697A25A1F9528C0DCE46CEFA4DC550A

        "text": "The Killnet hacktivist groups DDoS attacks against healthcare and the mass data exfiltration in January was reportedly just the first round of targeting Industry leaders have grown increasingly concerned over the impact of nation-state actors and the possibility it will only get worseThis is a war Carter Groome First Health Advisory founder and CEO said during the Chime State of Cybersecurity in Healthcare Virtual Summit We got our clocks cleaned by nation-state actors last week and nobody's really talking about itEvery week every year we're on the frontlines And we think this can't get any worse then it does he continued adding that the amount of damage being inflicted on the healthcare sector the vital part of the nation's critical infrastructure cannot be overstated Simply put our ability to provide care is in jeopardy While some healthcare stakeholders have declined to report broadly on the ongoing DDoS attacks and nation-state hacking as to not draw attention to the nefarious acts Groome has opted to use the impacts as a call to action to Congress and in hopes providers can better defend themselvesBut until January no major US attacks were reportedThat seemed to change when the Department of Health and Human Services Cybersecurity Coordination Centers Jan 31 alert warned that the Killnet hacktivists exfiltrated data from a number of hospitals in January and publicly shared the health and personal information they hacked from the networksThe initial estimates placed the total impact at about a dozen organizations But a conversation between SC Media and one US health system CISO suggested that number was much higherKillnet reportedly went after 17 high profile US health organizations After successfully exploiting those networks the group decided to add one organization from every state according to the CISO who spoke with SC Media who admitted their entity was among those targetedThe group targeted their domain host which resulted in their health system website being brought down for four hours while the health system worked with their vendor to restore access The attack however was unsuccessful given their appropriate DDoS defensesSince the initial wave of attacks Killnet has added more and more to their list One Telegram channel warned round one is over and announced Round 2 is ongoingDDoS protection tools prevent malicious traffic from reaching the target and limit the impact while allowing normal traffic flow Without it an organization targeted with a volumetric attack can degrade website performance or even knock it offline In more serious cases an entity may not be able to communicate those outages with clients or patients in the healthcare spaceThe latest HC3 alert on these DDoS campaigns warn that the attacks have the potential to prevent providers from accessing vital resources which may have detrimental impact on the ability to provide care The effectiveness is due to the devices able to be exploited by these attacks telehealth platforms patient portals EHRs and even patient-monitoring applicationsAdversaries will use web application attacks such as DDoS attacks to target an organizations most exposed infrastructure such as web servers to exploit a weakness in an internet facing computer or software according to the alertThese hacktivist groups are leveraging DDoS attacks as theyre cost-effective and require low resources and technical skills to deploy The actors dont even need to install code on victims servers to find successThese attacks can cause disruptions that may interrupt business continuity by keeping patients or healthcare personnel from accessing critical healthcare assets such as electronic health records software-based medical equipment and websites to coordinate critical tasks HC3 addedGroome whose company represents a large market share of health systems is increasingly concerned about the damage and impact of the incidentsThe previous HC3 alert described traffic surges from the DDoS campaigns causing website outages that can last for several hours or days warning organizations to ensure theyre employing adequate DDoS protectionThe verdict may be out on the possible fallout and overall impact this may have on the targeted entities particularly if the entity does not have the tools needed to fend off or recover from a successful exploit But all of the leading stakeholder groups agree that although Killnet is notorious for exaggerating the impact of attacks the threat to critical infrastructure is credibleHealthcare cybersecurity and its ongoing resource and vulnerability challenges are a threat to national security its a patient safety issue explained Mari Savickis Chimes vice president of public policy during last weeks Chime summitHowever it remains to be seen what measures will be put into place and whenThe paper has signaled that healthcare has congressional attention and cyber is a bipartisan issue said SavickisHealthcare will certainly need the help of the executive branch and Congress to empower HHS to administer those baseline cybersecurity practices outlined in Warners policy paper and that stakeholders have long-requested Groome saidWe need a lot more support for something impactful to happen Groome concluded Today we're facing attacks that are putting patients and health outcomes in harm's way like never beforeFor now provider organizations should review the newest DDoS threat analysis from HHS HC3 and yield stakeholder warnings as the second round of DDoS attacks may already be

        "text": "The number of ransomware attacks on industrial infrastructure grew significantly in 2022 according to researchers from cybersecurity firm DragosSo they're definitely going after manufacturing A heck of a lot more than electrical and gas Rob Lee CEO of Dragos told reporters last week Dragos found that there was a 35 bump in ransomware groups specifically targeting operational technology OT or industrial control systems ICS last year In total 437 manufacturing entities were hit with ransomware including 42 attacks on metal products companies 37 on automotive businesses and more than 20 on plastics industrial equipment building materials and electronics or semiconductors companies The rest of the list includes dozens of attacks on paper products automation aerospace furniture cosmetics chemicals clothing medical equipment and moreDragos listed a variety of reasons for the stark increase in ransomware attacks On one hand the number of ransomware groups and sophistication of tools are increasing rapidly After the downfall of the Conti ransomware group several others have stepped up to take their place The notorious LockBit ransomware gang led the way last year with 169 ransomware attacks followed by Conti before they closed shop Black Basta Alpha V and Hive Dragos found that of the 57 groups they track 39 were active in 2022 a 30 percent increase year over yearThere were multiple reasons for the increase in ransomware activity impacting industrial organizations including political tensions the introduction of Lockbit Builder and the continued growth of ransomware-as-a-service RaaS researchers wrote They also attributed the spike in part to political events including the conflict in Ukraine and the diplomatic rift between Iran and Albania Other indications of political partisanship which may have impacted industrial organizations include Contis declared alignment with the Russian Federation before it disbanded in May of 2022 they wroteConti targeted the automotive sector while multiple variants of LockBit were used to attack a range of industries including electric manufacturing construction transportation technology consumer services retail and logisticsDragos found a handful of new ransomware groups that emerged in third quarter of last year including SPARTA BLOG BIANLIAN Donuts ONYX and YANLUOWANGPart of why LockBit was so dominant is because it is the leading RaaS group providing its software to operators launching the actual attacks in exchange for a portion of the ransomsAccounting for 28 of all attacks last year LockBit offers operators exfiltration tools anti-detection mechanisms and the ability to disable Windows Defender softwareThe purported hacking of LockBit servers last year involving the leak of the LockBit 30 builder is likely to lead to further industrial attacks Dragos assesses with moderate confidence that LockBit 30 will continue to target industrial organizations and will pose a threat to industrial operations into 2023 whether through the LockBit gang itself or others creating their own version of LockBit ransomware they wroteAlongside the evolution of several ransomware groups was a steep increase in the number of vulnerabilities and technical issues found by security companies like DragosLee said Dragos incident responders found poor network segmentation and several other problems that plagued many industrial companiesEighty percent of Dragos customers had limited visibility into their ICS environments while more than half had issues with network segmentation undisclosed or uncontrolled external connections to their OT environment or lacked separate IT and OT user managementLee specifically highlighted one fact that bugged him about much of the reporting around ransomware attacks on industrial companies the idea that IT and OT networks were separate In many public statements about ransomware attacks companies typically say a ransomware attack only affected their IT systems and not the OT or ICS systemsAccording to Lee for many organizations this difference is purely semantic considering how intertwined many company systems are There are many manufacturing environments we've been to where they said Oh it's the IT systems that are hit and then we look and it's engineer workstations and interfaces and things like that Why would you call this IT Just because it's a Windows operating system doesn't make it IT It has specialized applications and a role in industrial operations That makes it OT he said adding there were cases Dragos was involved in where companies have incorrectly made these claimsSo I would just push for people to question some of those companies a bit more especially if you ever hear about operations coming down That's generally not just because an IT network is down he addedDragos also noted a significant increase in the amount of mistakes made in advisories More than 30 of the advisories tracked by Dragos had mistakes of some sort within them while less than half had mitigations a surprising discovery given that ICS systems often cannot be patched without significant operational disruption whereas a mitigation can be more targeted and less invasive Dragos also found that 83 of the vulnerabilities were buried deep within ICS networks and about half could cause both a loss of view and a loss of controlTo patch in the OT world often requires system and plant shut-downs ICSOT relies on alternative mitigation to both reduce risk and maintain production Dragos explained The fact that more than three out of four vulnerabilities lack that mitigation makes maintaining operations very challengingAs for this year Dragos said it is likely that ransomware will continue to disrupt industrial operations both through mismanaged OT environments that allow ransomware to spread or through precautionary shutdowns of those environments to prevent ransomware from reaching those systems Jonathan

malware or potentially interesting samples in sandboxes those usually have a time limit of fewer than five minutes per sample This means that if such a sample is run in a sandbox it won't reproduce

group drops NewsPenguin off many newly registered and newly updated IP blocklists and gives the threat actor higher quality results This shows that NewsPenguin has done some advance planning and has likely been conducting activity for a while Short-sighted attackers usually dont plan operations so far in advance and dont execute domain and IP reservations months before their utilizationBased on the lure theme and the nature of the event Pakistani companies manufacturing military technologies nation-states and military forces are highly likely to be the primary target That includes the organizers and those attending the Pakistan International Maritime Expo Conference especially the exhibitorsThe BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team have not been able to attribute this malware and associated indicators of compromise to any currently-known threat actor or group Given the highly focused nature of the targets the Pakistan maritime industry previously unseen tooling and new network infrastructure it is unlikely that the threat actor behind it is connected to casual cybercrime Instead we consider it highly likely that the attacker is a nation-state or an outsourced team working for a nation-state threat actorFor concerned parties a practical exercise would be to threat-hunt the potentially affected systems If an infection is confirmed then based on incident response IR exercises the goal would be to determine when the systems were infected and then based on the timeline and data on the system identify what confidential information may have been compromised Finally a full remediation should take place to mitigate any potential impactsNewsPenguin is a previously unknown threat actor relying on unseen tooling to target Pakistani users and potential visitors of the Pakistani International Maritime Expo ConferenceThe threat actor's timeline and preparation for this campaign show the attacker is continuously improving their tools to infiltrate victim systems Advanced planning to build network infrastructure months out from an event is rare within criminal enterprisesAs the target is an event run by the Pakistan Navy it implies that the

        "text": "Correction a previous version of this story and headline named all seven sanctioned members as Russian nationals Six were born in Russia while one was born in Ukraine SC Media regrets the errorThe US and UK governments took aim at the notorious Trickbot gang Thursday slapping economic sanctions on six Russians and one Ukrainian they say are associated with Russian intelligence services and whose preparations and targeting of US governments and companies in 2020 allegedly closely mirrored the targeting and larger objectives of the Russian governmentsAll of the named individuals were deeply involved in Trickbots cybercrime operations including developing malware or ransomware hacking into victim websites managing infrastructure or overseeing money laundering operations for the group according to the two governments The announcement even includes the nicknames and monikers that each operator all Russian-born uses online their email addresses and dates of birth Cyber criminals particularly those based in Russia seek to attack critical infrastructure target US businesses and exploit the international financial system Brian E Nelson US under secretary for the Treasury for terrorism and financial Intelligence said in a statement The United States is taking action today in partnership with the United Kingdom because international cooperation is key to addressing Russian cybercrimeThe sanctions reflect the decentralized structure that exists between different ransomware and cybercrime groups where individual hackers can often moonlight for different financial or state-backed hacking outfits and membership to any one group is often akin to a contractor relationshipAdam Meyers head of intelligence at CrowdStrike described the indicted members as part of a group they track under the moniker Wizard Spider which he described as a Russia-nexus cybercriminal group behind the core development and distribution of a sophisticated arsenal of criminal tools and whose members have been involved in the operations of TrickBot Conti and RyukThe link was notable because Trickbot previously did not have a meaningful footprint in the country prior to the invasion and previous versions of their malware configured to avoid Ukrainian-language systems and devices the researchers saidThe moves represent the first British sanctions levied on a ransomware group and the UK announcement also mentions the individuals in connection with other ransomware operations like Ryuk and ContiForeign Secretary James Cleverly named these groups as being responsible for causing untold damages to critical infrastructure businesses and individual victims around the worldThese cynical cyberattacks cause real damage to peoples lives and livelihoods We will always put our national security first by protecting the UK and our allies from serious organized crime whatever its form and wherever it originates Cleverly saidWhile WIZARD SPIDERs operations have significantly reduced following the demise of Conti in June 2022 these sanctions will likely cause disruption to the adversarys operations while they look for ways to circumvent the sanctions said Meyers Often when cybercriminal groups are disrupted they will go dark for a time only to rebrand under a new nameWhile Russian President Vladimir Putins government briefly appeared to take a harder line by arresting members of the REvil ransomware gang last year the moves were widely viewed as an attempt to entice US and Western governments to avoid openly opposing Russias invasion of Ukraine or sending Kyiv military and financial support The fact of the matter is that the US government has passed on information to the Russians about these actors months ago and the fact is were only seeing them act on it in the midst of these serious questions around a potential Ukraine invasion threats of various severe sanctions against the Russian economy and the counterthreat of Putin to break off diplomatic relations Dmitri Alperovitch the former founder of CrowdStrike who now runs the Silverado Policy Accelerator told SC Media in the run up to the invasionJamie Collier a senior threat advisor for Mandiant and Google Cloud noted that in the past economic sanctions have typically been used against nation-state hacking groups However the damage caused by ransomware within the US and other partners as well as the often ambiguous ties that some groups have to governments like Russia have made them a priority for policymakers in recent yearsWe're now seeing these methods increasingly used with ransomware actors reflecting the growing priority of cyber crime on national security agendas said CollierDerek is a senior editor and reporter at SC Media where he has spent the past three years providing award-winning coverage of cybersecurity news across the public and private sectors Prior to that he was a senior reporter covering cybersecurity policy at Federal

        "text": "This article was updated on 2132023 with an update from the researcher's report stating that the Toyota portal was created and is maintained by the automakerAn ethical hacker found a backdoor in a Web app used by Toyota employees and suppliers for coordinating tasks related to the automaker's global supply chain gaining control of the global system merely by knowing the email address of one of its usersOnce acting as an administrator Zveare said he had full access to internal Toyota projects documents and user accounts including some of those that belonged to Toyota external partners and suppliers such as Michelin Continental Stanley Black Decker and HarmanAll in all the researcher gained readwrite access to Toyota's global user directory of more than 14000 users Zveare also could access corporate user account details confidential documents projects supplier rankingscomments and other sensitive data related to those users he saidIndeed had a threat actor discovered the issue before him the consequences could have been severe Zveare observedThe issue could have allowed attackers to create their own user account with an elevated role to retain access should the issue ever be discovered and fixed or download and leak all the data to which they had access he saidThey also could have deleted or modified data in a way to be disruptive to global Toyota operations or crafted a highly targeted phishing campaign to attempt to capture real corporate login details which could have exposed other Toyota systems to attacks Zveare wroteThe researcher reported the issue to Toyota on Nov 3 and the company reported back 20 days later that it had been fixed a speedy response with which Zveare was impressed he saidOut of all the security issues I have reported so far to various vendors Toyotas response was the fastest and most effective he saidFortunately for Toyota the latest breach was an ethical one and thanks to Zveare's responsible disclosure the company could fix it before there was any impact on the company or its partners' business notes one security professionalHowever the GSPIMS API appeared to be secure which inspired Zveare to further dig into the application code to see what else might be cooking What he eventually found was that JSON Web Tokens or session tokens representing the users' valid authenticated sessions on the website were being generated based on a user's email without requiring a passwordZveare Googled for Toyota supply chain users and made an educated guess to formulate the email of someone who he thought would be a user of the GSPIMS portal Then I fired off the createJWT HTTP request and it returned a valid JWT he wroteHis discovery gave him the ability to generate a valid JWT for any Toyota employee or supplier registered in GSPIMS completely bypassing the various corporate login flows which probably also enforce two-factor authentication options Zveare wroteThough the user whose email he accessed the system with did not have system administrator privileges he eventually searched within the GSPIMS to find the email of someone who did and using that he gained full control of the system as an administratorEnterprises have work to do to in order to block the issue Zveare found security experts say For starters security administrators must take a more holistic approach to security and realize the wider impact their overall security posture or lack thereof can have on all of the partners and customers with whom they do businessWhat are perceived as 'internal systems' to organizations no longer are Dror Liwer co-founder of cybersecurity firm Coro said in an email statement to Dark Reading With partners suppliers and employees collaborating via the Internet all systems should be considered external and as such protected against malicious intrusionDeveloping this big-picture perspective and security strategy is not so simple as most enterprises already have their hands full managing their own company's risk notes Lorri Janssen-Anessi director of external cyber assessments for BlueVoyantHowever considering how easy it was for Zveare to gain access to a system that serves Toyota's global supply chain companies need to get their heads around this risk to maintain security across any third party that touches their network she saysWhat today's organizations should take from the reported vulnerability in Toyota's supplier management network is a firm reminder to look at their own vendor and supplier cybersecurity Janssen-Anessi saysAmong the key measures to consider include shoring up access control and user account privileges ensuring that they only provide employees and third-parties with access to the data needed for their particular role she notes This helps to control what data can be accessed in the event of a breach Janssen-Anessi saysIndeed a more data-centric approach overall to security could help enterprises avoid or mitigate a scenario that Zveare demonstrated Comforte AG's Horst observes He advises that organizations find ways to protect data as soon as it enters their corporate data ecosystem thus protecting the data itself rather than perimeters and borders around the dataCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick

been proactively working to solve the incident with support from law enforcement which has brought some of its care services back online Notably the health system canceled surgeries between Thursday and Monday but is now performing limited surgeries and proceduresThe networks for its labor and delivery facility as well as its connected physician practices are operational However clinicians are still leveraging paper processes for registration admission and during care which is causing expected delays in care Our teams are working around the clock in collaboration with outside consultants to investigate the cause of the event and safely restore all computer systems as quickly as possible according to the latest notice But as with most healthcare security incidents recovery is often slow-going For some of the largest health systems EHR downtime can last up to four weeksBut all hospital services remained open outside of its pharmacy outpatient imaging and pulmonary function testing services A website notice shows imaging and walk-in lab services remain closed The hospital has not provided an update outside of the initial reportA successful phishing attack against a Highmark employee in December potentially compromised the data of 300000 patientsThe notice shows an employee was sent an email with a malicious link which compromised their email account for two days between Dec 13 and Dec 15 Upon discovery Highmark immediately shut down the account reset passwords and implemented network blockingHowever the compromise enabled the threat actor to access emails within the account some of which contained patient dataThe data varied by patient and could include names and Social Security numbers as well as enrollment information like group names identification numbers claims data treatment information dates of service procedures and prescription information For some patients financial information contact details and email addresses were also compromisedHighmark is continuing to bolster its email security controls as it provides employees with further cyber and phishing training to help prevent future attemptsSharp Healthcare is notifying 62777 patients of a recent website hack that potentially compromised their protected health information Sharp Health is a nonprofit healthcare group based in San DiegoOn Dec 12 a hack was detected on a server that supports the Sharp Health website The IT team took the affected servers offline and launched incident response protocols The forensics later determined the activity was tied to a threat actor accessing a website server for several hours which led to the access of a single file containing patient dataThe data varied by patient and could include patient ID numbers invoice numbers payment amounts and provider names No financial data or further identifiers were compromised during the incident Sharp Health stressed that only patients who paid a bill or invoice using the online bill payment service between Aug 12 2021 and Jan 12 2023 were affectedThe health group has since enhanced its website security tools and is continuing to monitor its systems to proactively identify additional safeguardsA network hack against Cardiovascular Associates led to the theft of data for 441640 patients tied to its Alabama care sitesFirst discovered on Dec 5 a threat actor gained access to certain systems within the CA network After securing the impacted systems an investigation was launched with support from an outside forensic firm The forensic evidence revealed the access enabled the actor to copy some personal and health data from the network for a week between Nov 28 and Dec 5The stolen information could include demographic details SSNs health insurance information treatment information medical record numbers dates of service provider names diagnoses health assessment information tests and imaging and billing and claims data Some passports drivers licenses credit and

exfiltration of data tied to over 33 million patients It's the biggest healthcare data breach reported so far this year and impacts more patients than the third-largest incident reported in 2022The health group is known collectively as Regal and its notice shows the cyberattack began on Dec 1 but went undetected for one weekAfter experiencing difficulty in accessing some servers Regal performed an extensive review that found malware on some of its servers The subsequent investigation later found the incident was caused by a threat actor accessing and exfiltrating data from its systemsA third-party team helped the medical group with its response to the incident including restoring access to the systems and analyzing the impacted data The stolen data could include names SSNs for some patients dates of birth contact details diagnoses treatments lab test results prescriptions radiology reports and health plan numbersRegal is providing all impacted patients with a year of free credit monitoring and has since bolstered its security and protocolsA network hack deployed against Howard Memorial Hospital in December led to the exfiltration of data tied to 53668 patients HMH detected the hack on Dec 4 after the actor publicly claimed to have stolen patient data from its networkAn investigation confirmed the allegations and determined the threat actor first gained access on Nov 14 Upon discovery HMH secured the network and performed a comprehensive review to identify the potentially stolen informationBut ultimately HMH made the decision to notify all current or former patients and employees in an abundance of caution due to a potential impact to their information according to the noticeThe data possibly accessed or stolen by the attacker could include SSNs contact details

verticals and a chemical engineering department of a leading research universityDubbed No Pineapple the attacks leave an error message in a backdoors appended with the name in the event data exceeds segmented byte size The report shows it appears these attacks are designed to gather intelligence from victim organizations The victimology follows the established pattern of high-value targets in medical research and energy additionally WithSecure believes the threat actor has intentionally targeted the supply chain of these verticals according to the reportAs reported in the fall of 2022 a critical remote code vulnerability listed as CVE-2022-41352 and rated a 98 in severity was reported as actively exploited in the wild beginning in mid-SeptemberThe flaw is caused by the devices using an antivirus engine that employs a cpio utility to scan inbound emails A vulnerability in the utility can enable an attacker to create an archive to access any files within the Zimbra devicesThe WithSecure report suggests that this is exactly what happenedIts researchers responded to a cyberattack leveraging these tactics during Q4 2022 which has been attributed with high confidence to the Lazarus Group The forensic evidence shows signs of characteristics leveraged by the North Korea state-sponsored threat actors in other campaignsThe attack was deployed against a Zimbra mail server in August where the attackers exploited a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Zimbra server After a week of dwell time the threat actor exfiltrated approximately 100GB of data from the mail server without taking any destructive action by the point of disruptionAfter one month the threat actor laterally moved to a vulnerable domain joined by a Windows XP device Over a monthlong period the attacker continued to move laterally across the network performing reconnaissance and deploying multiple custom tools and malware Dtrack was one variant used which the researchers believe is an updated version of GREASEIn the observed campaign the threat actor used readily available off-the-shelf webshells and custom binaries in addition to abusing legitimate Windows and Unix tools A successful exploit can enable an attacker to install tools for proxying tunneling and relaying connectionsThe actor used many built-in commands to enumerate the network and compromised devices the report notes Some of these commands were hardcoded into binaries but others were run manually by the operators Many commands used were standard Windows command line tools though two PowerShell cmdlets were also runIts C2 behavior suggests that it employs a small number of C2 servers which are connected through multiple relays and endpoints The report notes that some C2 servers appear to themselves be compromised victimsWhats more web shells and Cobalt Strike beacons were observed which served as persistence mechanisms the report authors wrote Legitimate accounts were also compromised and the threat actors created illegitimate accounts The actor also created auto-run services and scheduled tasks commonly used to persist on a networkThe researchers warned that the actor also attempted to remove artifacts and indicators of their presence such as deleting files and tools and clearing logs to evade detection They also tried to give dropped files innocent names which would blend into the system In one instance they named files the same as directories within a parent network of exploited Zimbra serversThe report contains a long list of tactics and methods deployed during the observed

        "text": "FBI Director Christopher Wray center joined by Attorney General Merrick Garland right and Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco delivers remarks on an international ransomware enforcement action at the US Justice Department on Jan 26 2023 in Washington Photo by Kevin DietschGetty ImagesThe bureau was pilloried by much of the broader cybersecurity community as well as members of Congress for seemingly prioritizing its own investigative and law enforcement activities while leaving hundreds of Kaseya customers twisting in the wind agonizing over whether to pay millions of dollars in ransom or refuse and see their data lost or leaked on the internetFormer Rep Jim Langevin D-RI co-founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus who built a reputation as one of the most cyber-savvy House legislators echoed the frustration of many on the Hill and within the private sector when he chided Wray for the bureaus response analogizing it to the police blocking firefighters from putting out a house fire because it might damage forensic evidence that would help them investigate the arsonist I would just push back and say that asset response has to be higher on the priority list So much could have been prevented had those decryption keys been given to businesses that were impacted said LangevinThe reaction from former critics like Langevin as well as the details of the Hive takedown public comments by FBI leadership and interviews with former government officials indicate that the bureau may be internalizing some of the hard lessons it took from the fallout of the Kaseya incident when it comes to prioritizing victim recoveryAustin Berglas a former FBI cyber official said the Kaseya and Hive operations are things that are new situations that law enforcement and the FBI have been put into over the past half decade as cybercrime state-backed hacks and other forms of digital crime have become higher priorities for law enforcement and policymakersI think that when you look at what happened with Kaseya and now Hive there were huge lessons learned said Berglas now global head of professional services at BlueVoyant in an interviewThat learning curve includes a renewed emphasis on victim recovery both in operational priorities and public messagingWhereas during the Kaseya episode the FBI opted to keep their possession of REvils decryptor key a secret from victims a search warrant used to seize two US-based Hive servers on Jan 11 this year disclosed that agents had actually infiltrated the ransomware groups network six months earlier spending part of that time stealing over 1000 decryptors that they then quietly passed along to over 300 victims and businessesWray and others practically treated their press conference announcing the takedown as a commercial to advertise the unique benefits that businesses and victims could potentially reap by picking up the phone and calling the FBI in the wake of an incidentOur actions in this investigation should speak clearly to those victims it pays to come forward and to work with uswe need your help to stop cyber criminals to prevent future victims and in exchange we pledge our tireless efforts to help you protect your systems and to prevent or recover losses Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at one pointTo be clear there is still a fair bit we do not know about the precise circumstances behind the Hive operation such as what pushed the FBI to move on seizing the servers and shutting down Hives dark net sites in January how early the FBI used its access to Hives network to pilfer victim keys Monaco said the activities went on for months or precisely how the bureau balanced those needs with other investigative and disruptive prioritiesI think a lot of this is a reaction to things that they didnt quite get right or at least the perception that they didnt get right in the Kaseya case said Bryan Ware a former assistant director at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and is now CEO of LookingGlass Cyber Solutions You cant just tell businesses not to pay the ransom but then theyre left to their own devices This incident showsthat the bureau has some teeth here and is willing to be a good partnerThe Department of Justice will likely always need to walk a fine line between helping victims and gathering intelligence or moving to dismantle ransomware infrastructure before a group is potentially tipped off that their network is compromised However the renewed public focus on recovering lost data and getting organizations back up and running is absolutely a message of success and something that they will use as a foundation going forwardPrivate companies want to know if I share my intelligence and share my information what am I going to get back Thats the question always said Berglas relaying feedback the government frequently hears from cooperating businesses Often times were giving indicators of compromise and domains and IP addresses and all this stuff but I never hear anything back from you guys This is the FBIs message this is saying if you report these things to us our aperture can open up we can start helping youOne of the reasons the FBI and Department of Justice are increasingly emphasizing their remediation and recovery efforts these days may be because they have lost ground over the past few years to other federal agencies when it comes to being the cybersecurity communication gateway to the private sectorChiefly the elevation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency over the past five years has eaten into the FBIs role as the primary federal entry point for hacked organizationsThere remain large and meaningful differences between the writs of FBIs and CISA over cybersecurity issues For instance CISA has little if any authorities over traditional law enforcement investigations or prosecution of cybercrime focusing mainly on coordinating with private sector entities and providing technical assistance to insecure organizations Its also far smaller less resourced and lacks the authorities or capabilities to do anything like the Hive takedownWray often likes to note that the FBI has well-staffed field offices in every state and can often be at the door of a hacked business within an hour of getting a call Ware noted that despite the increased authorities and funding from Congress CISA still lacks anything close to that kind of reach and presence with approximately 150 cybersecurity advisors spread out across all 50 statesI think there is a desire to have that single front door for the private sector but theres some practical challenges One of those is that if its a criminal matter CISA is not a law enforcement agency it doesnt have the criminal authorities it cant do the same kind of investigations it cant recover lost funds it cant bring the bad guys to justice said WareThe flip side is that while the FBI and Wray have far more resources to bring to bear the bureau also have a much larger mission portfolio and their top cyber officials tend to operate lower in departmental hierarchy By contrast CISA and its director Jen Easterly essentially function as the top cybersecurity authorities within the Department of Homeland Security although technically other officials like undersecretary Rob Silvers sit above Easterly and wield influence over policy allowing for a sharper focus on cyber issuesThat hasnt stopped FBI officials from continuing to insist as Wray did at the end of the Hive presser that the agency still has a unique federal role and capabilities that should incentivize the private sector to reach out when they are hit with a cyberattackTodays lesson for businesses large and small for hospitals and police departments and really all the other many victims of ransomware is this reach out to your local FBI field office today Introduce yourself so that you know who to call if you become the victim of a cyber attack said Wray We are ready to help you build a crisis response plan so that when an intruder does come knocking youll be prepared and like the Hive victims here when you talk to us in

arrested this week in France A notorious hacker convicted of perpetrating tens of thousands of cybercrimes Kivimki had been in hiding since October 2022 when he failed to show up in court and Finland issued an international warrant for his arrestIn late October 2022 Kivimki was charged and arrested in absentia according to the Finns with attempting to extort money from theVastaamo Psychotherapy Center In that breach which occurred in October 2020 a hacker using the handle Ransom Man threatened to publish patient psychotherapy notes if Vastaamo did not pay a six-figure ransom demandVastaamo refused so Ransom Man shifted to extorting individual patients sending them targeted emails threatening to publish their therapy notes unless paid a 500-euro ransomWhen Ransom Man found little success extorting patients directly they uploaded to the dark web a large compressed file containing all of the stolen Vastaamo patient recordsIt was a huge opsec operational security fail because they had a lot of stuff in there including the users private SSH folder and a lot of known hosts that we could take a very good look at Kurittu told KrebsOnSecurity declining to discuss specifics of the evidence investigators seized There were also other projects and databasesPolice responding to the scene were admitted by another woman possibly a roommate and found the man inside still sleeping off a long night When they roused him and asked for identification the 6 3 blonde green-eyed man presented an ID that stated he was of Romanian nationalityThe French police were doubtful After consulting records on most-wanted criminals they quickly identified the man as Kivimki and took him into custodyKivimaki and other HTP members were involved in mass-compromising web servers using known vulnerabilities and by 2012 Kivimkis alias Ryan Cleary was selling access to those servers in the form of a DDoS-for-hire service Kivimki was 15 years old at the timeThe DDoS-for-hire service allegedly operated by Kivimki in 2012In 2013 investigators going through devices seized from Kivimki found computer code that had been used to crack more than 60000 web servers using a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobes ColdFusion softwareAs KrebsOnSecurity reported at the time this small ColdFusion botnet of data broker servers was being controlled by the same cybercriminals whod assumed control over ssndobms which operated one of the undergrounds most reliable services for obtaining Social Security Number dates of birth and credit file information on US residentsKivimkialso was involved in calling in multiple fake bomb threats and swatting incidents reporting fake hostage situations at an address to prompt a heavily armed police response to that locationKivimkis apparent indifference to hiding his tracks drew the interest of Finnish and American cybercrime investigators and soon Finnish prosecutors charged him with an array of cybercrime violations At trial prosecutors presented evidence showing hed used stolen credit cards to buy luxury goods and shop vouchers and participated in a money laundering scheme that he used to fund a trip to MexicoKivimki was ultimately convicted of orchestrating more than 50000 cybercrimes But largely because he was still a minor at the time 17 he was given a 2-year suspended sentence and ordered to forfeit EUR 6558The danger in such a decision is that it emboldens young malicious hackers by reinforcing the already popular notion that there are no consequences for cybercrimes committed by individuals under the age of 18Kivimki is now crowing about the sentence Hes changed the description on his Twitter profile to Untouchable hacker god The Twitter account for the Lizard Squad tweeted the news of Kivimkis non-sentencing triumphantly All the people that said we would rot in prison dont want to comprehend what weve been saying since the beginning we have free passesSomething tells me Kivimki wont get off so easily this time assuming he is successfully extradited back to Finland A statement by the Finnish police says they are seeking Kivimkis extradition and that they expect the process to go smoothlySame thing Kivimki replied Shall we start some kind of club A support organization for wanted persons This entry was posted on Sunday 5th of February 2023 1114 AM Interesting article a guy with anger issues that does swatting bomb threats and domestic violence hacks into a psychotherapy practice without any remorse Who sees the irony here Fantastic news and well done to all of the investigators involved Kivimaki has been a menace to society stealing money and blackmailing ever since he got a slap on the wrist for 50000 counts of hacking There are many reformed hackers but Kivimaki is not one of themYes string this career hacker criminal up by his thumbs in Solitary Confinement for the rest of his twisted life Far too many times these cybercrooks get a mild slap on the wrist and theyre back on the cyber highway after spreading their knowledge to anyone smart enough with whom theyre incarceratedMake an example of this punkI totally agree All hackers need to be held accountable and given serious prison sentences Additionally they should be prohibited from using any technology for their entire sentence They should be limited to only writing letters and sending them by snail mail or 5 minute monitored plain old trlephone calls home Confinement should ensure that their technical skills go down the toilet forever Do not pamper these criminals I would rather see minor drug abusers be given a break and rehabilitation and let all these cyber criminals rot in prison These criminals are attacking medical organizations and that makes the violent criminals against the sickGutter criminal Off with his

governments were not providing basic infrastructure people that need the Internet would not exist The real survivalist live off the gridThis is really good news I hope it will bring some kind of closure to the individuals affected especially by the absolutely shameless Vastaamo data breach and patient record publicationWho among us hasnt accidentally uploaded our entire home to the dark web His arrogance seems unwarranted Glad hell be out of circulationIts honestly a wonder why he didnt get caught sooner being that stupid Im legitimately bewildered as to how that happensGlad to see some of the worst of humans get a little suffering too for a changeHe used his keyboardscomputers just like a gun in the back He is a COWARD and a THUG that sneeks into our private and professional lives Its time for raising the amount of time and TRUTH in SENTENCING for CYBER CRIMINALS Onec the thief is released keep himthem on paper for 10 yrs C if these looser laugh at thatId rather not be paid in imaginary moneyI enjoy these stories Thank you Brian KrebsSadly the Finnish criminal law system is notoriously lenient and understanding to criminals If he gets 2 years let alone more that would be extraordinary After that the system is heavily geared towards integrating this PoS back into societyBut of course things like this bullying abusing and extorting the vulnerable is not something that is generally kindly looked on by hardcore criminals Recently a suspected child molester who was apparently innocent however was beaten and tortured to death by other prisoners while in police custody in FinlandIt is entirely possible that Julius Kivimki might have a very interesting jail time involving one or more peculiar accidentsYou cannot put child molesting on the same level as extortion No one in prison will do that lolWho would attack a healthcare organization That is really low This is where folks are struggling to stay alive and you will go over and pull the plug to buy Gucci socks Even Satan stopped that Lock him up for a long time and update the laws that allow these acts to persist If you are truly smart with computers use your skills for good and you will be rewarded by societykyllstyi patonkiin vois kirjottaa kirjan ja knty uskoon tiilenpit lueskellessaI think this kid needs a job and a wife I say cut his index fingers clean off tattoo a big shlong on his forhead and mutilate his toung He will soon then seek mental health he saught to abuse in the passed then release him Let the world and life be his punishmentshifted to extorting individual patients sending them targeted emails threatening to publish their therapy notesThreatening psy patients I wish for him some of them were not hard-boiled psychopathIts concerning to see the extent of damage that one individual can inflict through cybercrime The fact that Julius Kivimki has been involved in numerous hacking incidents including the extortion and leak of therapy notes for thousands of patients is alarmingHopefully his arrest will serve as a warning to others who engage in similar activities and reinforce the importance of cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive informationComments are

organizations in the Middle East for cyberespionage in December 2022 using a new backdoor malware The campaign abuses legitimate but compromised email accounts to send stolen data to external mail accounts controlled by the attackersBy Mohamed Fahmy Sherif Magdy Mahmoud ZohdyFebruary 02 2023Read time wordsSave to FolioOn December 2022 we identified a suspicious executable detected by Trend Micro as TrojanMSILREDCAPAD that was dropped and executed on multiple machines Our investigation led us to link this attack to advanced persistent threat APT group APT34 and the main goal is to steal users credentials Even in case of a password reset or change the malware is capable of sending the new credentials to the threat actors Moreover after analyzing the backdoor variant deployed we found the malware capable of new exfiltration techniques the abuse of compromised mailbox accounts to send stolen data from the internal mail boxes to external mail accounts controlled by the attackers While not new as a technique this is the first instance that APT34 used this for their campaign deployment Following this analysis it is highly likely that this campaigns routine is only a small part of a bigger chain of deployments Users and organizations are strongly advised to reinforce their current security measures and to be vigilant of the possible vectors abused for compromiseRoutineIn this section we describe the attack infection flow and its respective stages as well as share details on how the group uses emails to steal and exfiltrate critical informationFirst Stage Initial DroppersWe found the initial stage Net dropper malware called MrPerfectInstaller detected by Trend Micro as TrojanMSILREDCAPAD responsible for dropping four different files with each component stored in a Base64 buffer inside the main dropper It drops the followingThe dropper also adds the following registry key to assist in implementing the password filter dropped earlierHKEYLOCALMACHINESYSTEMControlSet001ControlLsa Notification Packages scecli psgfilterThe main Net binary implements two arguments for its operation the first argument for installing the second stage and the second argument for uninstalling it and unregistering the password filter droppedSecond Stage Abusing The Dropped Password Filter PolicyThese password filters can be abused by a threat actor as a method to intercept or retrieve credentials from domain users domain controller or local accounts local computer This is because for password filters to perform password validation requires the password of the user in plaintext from the Local Security Authority LSA Therefore installing and registering an arbitrary password filter could be used to harvest credentials every time a user changes his password This technique requires elevated access local administrator and can be implemented with the following stepsUsing this technique the malicious actor can capture and harvest every password from the compromised machines even after the modification The DLL has three export functions to implement the main functionality of support for registering the DLL into the LSA as followsWhen implementing the password filter export functions the malicious actor took great care working with the plaintext passwords When sent over networks the plaintext passwords were first encrypted before being exfiltratedData Exfiltration Through Legitimate Mail TrafficThe main backdoor function detected by Trend Micro as BackdoorMSILREDCAPA receives the valid domain credentials as an argument and uses it to log on to the Exchange Server and use it for data exfiltration purposes The main function of this stage is to take the stolen password from the argument and send it to the attackers as an attachment in an email We also observed that the threat actors relay these emails via government Exchange Servers using vaild accounts with stolen passwordsFirst the Net backdoor parses a config file dropped in the main root path where it is executing from and checks for a file callled ngb inside ProgramDataWindowsSoftwareDevicesDevicesTemp to extract three parametersHowever the malware also supports for the modification of old passwords to new ones which are sent through the registered DLL password filterThe malware proceeds to initialize an ExchangeService object in the first step and supplies the stolen credentials as WebCredentials to interface with the victim mail server in the second step Using these Exchange Web Service EWS bindings the malicious actor can send mails to external recipients on behalf of any stolen user and initialize a new instance of the WebCredentials class with the username and password for the account to authenticateThe malware then iterates through the files found under the target path For each file found it adds its path to a list which will be exfiltrated later in the last stepThe final stage is to iterate over the collected list of file paths For each path it prepares an EmailMessage object with the subject Exchange Default Message and a mail body content of Exchange Server is testing services The iteration attaches the whole file to this EmailMessage object and sends it using the previous initalized EWS form Steps 1 and 2 in Figure 10 which already authenticated the user accountAPT34 Targeting and Arsenal EvolutionFrom three previously documented attacks we observed that while the group uses simple malware families these deployments show the group's flexibility to write new malware based on researched customer environments and levels of access This level of skill can make attribution for security researchers and reverse engineers more difficult in terms of tracking and monitoring because patterns behaviors and tools can be completely different for every compromiseWhile not at the top of the groups list other countries in the Middle East considered as targets are Qatar Oman Kuwait Bahrain Lebanon and EgyptAttribution AnalysisThere are several data points and indicators that suggest APT34 carried out this attack and that this group is still active in targeting countries in the Middle East with a special focus on compromising government entities1 The first stage dropper2 Leveraging exchange servers for communications Uni- and bidirectional3 The victim targetedConclusionsAt first glance security teams can mistakenly tag the sample as safe or as a benign activity given the validity of the domains and mail credentials It will take more experienced analysts to see that the domains abused is part of a bigger active directory domain forest which share a trust relationship with each other to allow different government ministries or agencies to communicate Considering we found a compromised account from one entity inside a sample sourced from a different agency indicates APT34 now has a deep foothold in the government domain forestFollowing the stages executed APT34s repeated use of the Saitama backdoor technique in the first stage indicates a confidence that even the dated malwares technique will continue to work and initiate compromiseThe next stages for exfiltrating data however are considerably new and are considered exploratory for the group Despite the routine's simplicity the novelty of the second and last stages also indicate that this entire routine can just be a small part of a bigger campaign targeting governments We continue tracking and monitoring the abuse of this threat to determine the depth and breadth of this compromiseIndicators of

        "text": "Since this is a new threat actor we are tracking it as Ice Breaker APT Although research is still ongoing we are releasing this article to reveal the attacker's Modus Operandi attack chain ways to mitigate the threat and supported IOCs TTPs and YaraIce Breaker is using a very specific social engineering technique that somewhat sacrifices their identity said Senior Threat Researcher Felipe DuarteAlthough we haven't yet discovered Ice Breaker's whereabouts or preferred language we are still interested in sharing the information we have with infosec community and the IT security of the gamblinggaming industry as we are approaching the ICE London conference in February This is the industry's largest conference in the world hosting over 35000 people Our aim is to block the campaign while still researching more about its maker Ice BreakerThe name Ice Breaker was born from the name of the main conference of this industry ICE and the proximity of the campaign to its starting date February 6th 2023Social engineering prior to sending malicious links to hide executables is a clever tactic as this threat actor was well-aware of the fact that the customer service is human-operated Without proper guidance for the teams on the other end it almost seemed logical that an unregistered user would be having trouble logging in or registering and thus the attacker sends links to images instead of embedding them in the chatConvincing the human operator to open the ZIP or LNK file the threat actor was only steps away from harvesting credentials open a reverse shell and start the 2nd stage of the attack Out of four incidents we've investigated only one used DropBox as trusted downloader link It was an option the attacker didn't choose initially but following his frustration over transcripts of the conversation when his screenshot lure did not follow through he had no other choice The main payload they chose was something that hadn't been documented before In this blog post our team reveals pieces from the investigations to share the complexity of the 2nd stage involving Nodejs compiled binaries jsc which are embedded in the malware executable and are being decoded at run-time We were able to find the tool that is responsible for generating the bytecode of the jsc called Bytenode As far as we know generating a malware using this technique is easy however reverse engineering this bytecode back to the original source code is highly complex While our team keeps researching ways to reverse engineer the bytecode we are sharing this information with the infosec community in an attempt to gain more understanding into the process of creating that malwareIt is important to highlight that many operators in the gaminggambling industry provide support to their clients via dedicated channels handled by them or in some cases they outsource this operation to specialized companies BPOs in an attempt to reduce the operational costs Depending on the nature of this customer-business relationship there are several risks associated that we cannot leave aside and this is exactly what this APT actor is trying to exploit hereAccording to the infection attempts we've investigated this attack vector could result in major damage if not properly protected and company's personnel not being trained to act against such scenarios and report immediately to security staffThe Modus Operadi of the attacker is to pretend to be a customer of the website with an issue such logging in or registering when in reality the visitor does not have an account This should be the first indicator that something is not rightBased on the evidence collected by our team it seems that all of the individuals carrying out the attacks are not English speakers who intentionally choose to speak with non-native English customer service representatives probably to reduce their chances of being detected as scams As an example in one of the incidents handled by our team the attacker even asks for a Spanish speaker and when approached with one he immediately changes back to broken EnglishIncident 1 - Pretending to have a registration issueIncident 2 The attacker chooses the French language in the customer service portal and shares links to ZIP files supposedly containing images The proxy from which the attacker is connecting appears to be located in Japan Incident 3 The attacker is requesting a Spanish-speaking agent but continues to speak in English In this example it is easy to pick up the IDN Homograph AttackLooking at the intrusions of this threat actor from the outside without going into the details we are dealing with a fairly simple control flowThe control flow consists of only two stages each one with a clear objectiveThe threat actor is distributing two different types of payloads to the victim during the conversation According to the data we have the LNK file is the primary payload and it is the first one presented to the customer service agent The VBS file on the other hand is only shared as a backup option in case the agent is unable to open the first file Depending on the malicious file executed by the victim either the LNK or the VBS a different payload is provided If the victim executes the LNK downloader it will fetch and execute an additional MSI package containing an IceBreaker Backdoor which is a new threat has not been previously described as far as we know in any other publicly available threat intelligence report However if the victim executes the VBS downloader it will fetch the infamous Houdini RAT a VBS-based Remote Access Trojan that has been active at least since since 2013 The threat actor is distributing LNK files via a set of domain names that mimic the legitimate domain screenshotnet Once the victim accesses it the website presents a very simple view to download the allegedly screenshot in an attempt to deceive the customer service agent to download the malicious content see Figure belowOnce the customer service agent downloaded the decoy file supposedly to be the screenshot reported by the threat actor in the conversation heshe was required to unzip its content and run the extracted LNK file on the machine To make the threat more convincing to the victim the icon of this Windows Shortcut was changed to match the default Windows picture icon as shown in the image belowThe purpose of the LNK file is fairly simple to understand it downloads an additional MSI payload from its C2 server by abusing the trusted Windows binary msiexecexe Below an example of the command executed by a malicious LNK file is provided in it it is also clear the attempt to impersonate one more time the official website screenshotnet by abusing some characters of the Unicode standard The arguments in the command line are the followingi this argument is used to specify that the installer should perform an install operationpassive this argument is used to display progress bar only it does not prompt the user with any user interfacequiet this argument runs the installer in quiet mode with no user interactionqn this argument is used to run the installer with no user interfaceOnce that file was launched our team was able to capture the execution flow isolate the machine and begin the investigation Having the knowledge of that user belonging to customer service immediately triggered a suspicion that this executable's origin is from an external service The string that will contain the URL of the malicious server is initialize It contains the http string and some random data that will be removed laterThe request object that will be used later to submit the data to the malicious server is initialized and the malicious URL is completed It contains the IP address of the malicious server hardcoded in an octal representationThe User-Agent header is set to the local time of the infected machineThe response of the server is gotten and executed Once the connection has been established it sends a POST request to an IP address converted in Octal which represents the value 178636551Two different payloads are being used by this treat actor during the second stage of the attack Among them only one stood out because it implements several techniques never seen before in a public available report We provide the details of each threat found during the investigation in the following subsectionsOnly when the victim downloaded and executed the secondary payload distributed during the conversation with the attacker this threat is launched The threat found during our research matches perfectly the behavior described by Mandiant in their report the only difference is the C2 hardcoded in the script which in this case was set to 19459717 as presented in the following pictureThe MSI file downloaded and executed by the Windows shortcut is the starting point of this second stage If the reader wants to follow the analysis of this threat the details below could be used to download it from the OSINT platform of hisher preference The only relevant file inside this MSI package is a CAB archive which acts as a second layer of protection and contains a compressed version of the malicious backdoor The installer extracts this archive to the Temp folder and finally the third layer of the attack is executedIt doesn't really matter what modifications are made to the MSI package its purpose is always the same to drop and execute an embedded PE file called Portexe This embedded resource is the most interesting part of the attack It is a PE file written in C and compiled for 64-bit systems Its size is larger than the average malware sample typically handled by our team and it contains many references to Nodejs including but not limited to its icon several strings and additional software propertiesAfter a close inspection something unusual was found in the overlay of this file To clarify the overlay of a PE file is a portion of data that is appended to the end of the original executable This data is not loaded automatically by Windows when the file is executed because it is outside the PE structure However it is a fast and easy way to add additional resources required by the software without affecting the structure of the PEStoring data in the overlay is not inherently malicious but it is a technique commonly used by threat actors toBypass signature-based detectors by easily changing the hash of a PE file without modifying its structure or functionalityMake the process of analyzing the file more difficult by dramatically increasing the size of the file with random data making it harder for analysis tools to handleHide additional resources such as other PE files and binaries that will be loaded during the execution of the file particularly in droppers and packersIn this case however a very characteristic structure was found in the overlay It wasn't just random data or highly obfuscated binaries that were left there by a packer or dropper In this case we were dealing with something additional a type of binary data used by the JavaScript engine to speed up the parsing process of JavaScript codeSeveral attempts have been made to decompile this kind of code but there is still a lack of tools that can keep up with these developments In fact based on our research we have identified only two different projects that try to tackle this challenge using two different perspectives According to our research we foundNone of the solutions above are suitable for analyzing this sample because they are incompatible with the Nodejs version found in the samples above 8160 Our researchers are currently conducting additional analyses to address this issue and to help the community deal with this type of threat However we still obtained relevant results about the capabilities of the malicious JSC artifact by looking at its strings after extracting its contents from the overlay As seen in the image below which contains a snippet of the compiled JavaScript extracted from the sample there are several strings that give us an idea about the scope of the malicious actions that this sample could execute on an infected machineBased on the abovementioned we concluded that we are dealing with a new modular backdoor written completely in Nodejs and provides threat actors with a set of functionalities such as Customization via plugins that extend the build-in features of the threatProcess discoverySteal passwords and cookies from the local storage It particularly targets Google ChromePersistence is achieved by creating a new LNK file in the startup folder MicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsStartupWINNlnkExfiltrate files to the remote server via web socketsRun custom VBS scripts in the infected machineTake screenshots from the victim's machineGenerate remote shell sessionsAll these capabilities in addition to the very low detection rate of the payload which during this investigation has remained close to zero even after 3 months of its first report see image below are the perfect recipe for the success of this threat actor We are currently tracking this tool as the IceBreaker Backdoor and we continue researching it to help community understand identify and effectively respond against this new threatWe provide the following set of ideas to the infosec community in an attempt to help hunting this threat on your environments feel free to test them and improve them if requiredLook for LNK files created in the startup folder and specially search for the name WINNlnkLook for any unauthorized execution of the open-source tool tsocksexe in your environment You can hunt this by looking for new processes created with that name or following the structure of the commands used by this tool Monitor closely the creation of msiexecexe processes receiving URLs as parametersMonitor closely the execution of VBS scripts and LNK files launched from the Temp folder

        "text": "New versions of the Prilex point-of-sale malware can block secure NFC-enabled contactless credit card transactions forcing consumers to insert credit cards that are then stolen by the malwareOn a payment terminal contactless transactions use NFC Near Field Communication chips embedded in credit cards and mobile devices to conduct close-proximity payments via credit cards smartphones or even smartwatchesHowever using NFC chips in credit cards has made it harder for point of sale PoS malware to steal credit card information causing threat actors to develop new methods to steal your payment informationKaspersky following the Prilex PoS malware closely reports seeing at least three new variants in the wild with version numbers 06038070 06038072 and 06038080 first released in November 2022These new variants introduce a new feature that prevents payment terminals from accepting contactless transactions forcing customers to insert their cardsWhen the new Prilex feature is enabled it will block contactless transactions and display a Contactless error insert your card error on the payment terminalThis forces the victim to finish the transaction by inserting a credit card making capturing the card information through the payment terminal easierThe malware uses a rule-based file to determine if it should block a transaction based on whether it has detected the use of NFCPrilex's operators block NFC transactions because those generate a unique ID or card number that's only valid for a single transaction so if that data is stolen it wouldn't be helpful for the crooksAfter the credit card data is captured the Prilex operators employ the techniques seen in previous releases like cryptogram manipulation and GHOST transaction attacksAnother interesting new feature seen for the first time on the latest Prilex variants is the ability to filter unwanted cards and only capture data from specific providers and tiersPayees have limited means to protect themselves against PoS malware like Prilex as there's no way to know if a payment terminal might be infectedStandard security measures include avoiding paying on terminals with visible signs of tampering avoiding using public WiFi to access financial accounts without a VPN or failing to validate the transaction details before and after its completionMoreover it is essential to regularly monitor financial statements to identify any potentially fraudulent transactions or charges that should be reported to the card issuer immediately"
