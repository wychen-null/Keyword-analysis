        "text": "Tech News and AnalysisAs cloud infrastructure and compliance regulations become more complicated companies are looking to simplify data security by adopting more pervasive encryption of sensitive data and consolidating key management into a single repository or serviceOn March 22 email and file security firm Virtru became the latest data-protection firm to offer customers a single vault for key management when it announced a private keystore that works with Google Workspace Google Cloud and the company's other products The product manages encryption keys configures policies and allows audits of access to encrypted dataVirtru had already offered encryption for email and files stored in the cloud but the sensitivity of data and need for complying with government requirements led customers to ask for a hold-your-own-key or HYOK capability says Mike Morper senior vice president of product at VirtruWe have customers that have come to us who want to ensure absolutely no entity other than the intended recipient has access to a particular piece of information Morper says We first started hearing this rooted in a lot of data-sovereignty conversations particularly with some of our customers in Europe and it was paramount to them that they would have the ability to manage their own private keysMoreover a set of headaches including managing keys limiting who can access data and auditing that access have grown more severe as companies need to comply with privacy regulations from multiple countries and ensure the security of data across multiple clouds says Kevin McKeogh vice president of product management for data protection solutions at EntrustEncrypting data is easy Managing the keys that are used to encrypt the data is what becomes increasingly challenging for organizations as they scale operations he says With a growing volume of data now processed across distributed systems on-premises and in multicloud environments organizations need to maintain control of the keys to ensure data is protected and available to the applications that need to use the data and to stay compliant to regulationsThe typical enterprise has at least five different key managers deployed so key sprawl is an issue says Todd Moore vice president of encryption products at Thales This complicates things like key rotation and retiring keys The best practice is to have one centralized key management platform that can support the vast majority of your key management operationsIn addition companies that rely on a single cloud provider's key management solution may be at greater risk Privacy and data-protection regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR and the Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standard PCI-DSS explicitly require or heavily imply that encrypting sensitive data is necessary and that self-custody of keys is preferred says Andy Manoske principal product manager for cryptography and security at HashiCorpThis is especially the case if data sovereignty requirements attempting to protect against a privileged adversary within a client's cloud service infrastructure are at play he says While an adversary may not be able to compromise that key management system they could render it inoperable if they have privilege within a single cloud hosting both data encryption and key managementWhile a private keystore is a solution it is not the only one Key-management services that provide HYOK can satisfy government regulations and business security requirements while still giving companies the expertise and support they need to manage a complex task Keys need to be protected but defenders must understand the company's threat model and what types of attacks are likely in order to best select the appropriate encryption technologiesDeploying encryption and maintaining a private keystore require some deep expertise within a company Manoske saysPrivate keystores usually provide flexibility in how keys are retrieved and used for cryptography a flexibility usually necessary when deploying cryptography within high-performance applications with significant automation Manoske says This flexibility comes at the cost of usually requiring more sophistication from the defender in protecting against side-channel attacks attacks that 'go around' the mathematical protections of cryptography to tamper with or steal keysWhile a company can retain ownership of critical keys some KMaaS offerings can simplify the business' data security and provide necessary capabilities such as access control and auditability says Virtru's MorperThat's the hard part and frankly probably where the preponderance of adoption and friction come into play he says So it really starts to become a balance for organizations It's a security-policy decision and a business decision they need to make what level of friction is appropriate and against what degree of riskCopyright 2023 Informa PLC

IslandsVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingBitter APT are continuing to target organizations in China in an espionage campaign as our here research shows For some of the payloads we have corresponding phishing emails that were used as lures to deliver the files allowing analysis of the social engineering techniques used We have noted updates to the first-stage payloads used with new layers of obfuscation to hinder analysis and additional decoys used for social engineeringThe emails contain a number of social engineering techniques The name and email address used to send the phishing emails is crafted to look like it is coming from an Embassy in Beijing A free email provider is used therefore domain reputation checks will not be usefulThe email is signed off with the name and details of an actual attach of the Kyrgyz embassy in China If the recipient were to use a search engine to check for this employee they would easily be able to find corroborating information from LinkedIn and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website for Kyrgyzstan adding to the supposed legitimacy of the email This is presumably also how the malicious actor was able to get information in order to craft the lureThe email subject and body use terms and themes that would be familiar with the recipients in governmental and energy sectors such as International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA China Institute of International Studies CIIS strategic alliances and nuclear doctrinesMultiple payloads have been observed being delivered Either CHM files or Microsoft Excel files with Equation Editor exploits These payloads are compressed inside RAR files this helps avoid static analysis techniques that do not decompress the files first The purpose of the payloads are to create persistence and download further malware payloads We were not able to get further additional payloads from the command and control C2 servers but in some instances were able to get the file names of next stages from active C2sThe second scheduled task created attempts to execute the payload downloaded by the other taskThe more common payloads contained within the RAR files are Microsoft Compiled HTML Help CHM files These can be used to simply execute arbitrary code in these cases they are also used to create scheduled tasks for persistence and downloading of the next stage We have noted multiple versions of these CHM payloads CHM payloads are useful for the actor as it requires a low amount of user interaction it does not require a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office installed like the Excel files and it also uses LZX compression that will bypass static malware analysis solutions that do not decompress the fileWe did not fetch any additional payloads from the C2 but we were served empty MSI files allowing us to discover the names of the next stage payloadsThe decoded command is the followingIt is evident that the C2 controllers have been updated also as now only the computer name is sent to the C2 and not the username What is interesting about the next version is that it now contains a decoy picture when openedThe decoy appears to reference the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party The following is a machine translated version of the same picture for reference please note that the translation will not be fully accurate and should be used for reference purposes onlyAlways take care when handling attachments and never open CHM files as they are antiquated and not commonly used for legitimate purposes currently Want to learn more

        "text": "MITRE has quietly released a cloud-based prototype platform for its new System of Trust SoT framework that defines and quantifies risks and cybersecurity concerns for the supply chainThe SoT framework which is a cloud-native app hosted on AWS is centered around 14 top-level risk areas related to suppliers service providers and supplies including the financial stability and cybersecurity practices of the supplier as well as risk of counterfeit and compromise to products These risk categories are then used to evaluate a supplier or product during the acquisition process digging into detailed questions on how a supplier tracks and ensures the security of third-party software components used in their product for exampleThe System of Trust is very appealing because it gives a structure that's more comprehensive well laid-out and explains what kinds of risks you have in your supply chain in detail explains Robert Martin senior software and supply chain assurance principal engineer at MITRE Labs That goes beyond traditional risk measurement and assessment tools he notesThere are some 40 organizations currently involved in shaping the SoT platform which now includes some 660 specific supply chain categories and risk factors MITRE is gathering input to flesh out the tool from businesses with supply chains supply chain security vendors and standards groups that touch some elements of supply chain operations Among some of the big name members of the SoT community are Microsoft BlackBerry CISA Cisco Dell Technologies Intel Mastercard NASA Raytheon Schneider Electric Siemens and The Open GroupThe big thing they have here is they are doing what they have done with ATTCK and D3FEND provide a common language for everyone to use when we are talking about not only the position in the chain but the specific vulnerabilities or attack methods and defenses says Curt Franklin principal analyst for enterprise security management at OmdiaFranklin says MITRE's pedigree with its other cybersecurity programs should help propel the SoT but wide adoption likely will take time I can imagine some of the third-party risk assessment vendors building SoT into their products like they build FAIR Factor Analysis of Information Risk or ATTCK into theirs Franklin says I think the odds are good that SoT will be more widely adopted I think the odds are just as good that it will take a whileThat's because there still are multiple ways to define and measure risk in cybersecurity and no two models work together he says It's very difficult to say how my risk posture compares to my peers in the industry What something like this does is provide a particular framework for some common quantification of riskEach risk item in the RMM is scored using data measurements that are then applied to a scoring algorithm The resulting scores identify the strengths and weaknesses of a supplier for example against the specific risk categories That would allow a business to assess quantitatively the security risk of a software vendor or its product for exampleOne of the organizations closely working the project is Schneider Electric whose vice president of supply chain security Cassie Crossley will join Martin in an RSAC 2023 session on SoT called Creating the Standard for Supply Chain Risk MITRE's System of Trust Crossley says Schneider has multiple comprehensive supply chain risk assessment processes currently in place across different parts of the company and Schneider plans to provide input and feedback to the SoT based on its own requirements and metricsWe would want to work with those teams across Schneider to identify some areas where we can provide suggestions and also see how we can better align or sort of adopt more of the SoT framework Crossley says I don't know yet if we will have a full 'hey we are 100 SoT' But we would make our own processes and identify areas where we want to incorporate more of a structure for supply chain risk assessment she saysFor Schneider supply chain risk and security issues apply both to its own products and ones it buys for internal use including the third and fourth parties we work with she says She sees SoT possibly helping with visibility into risks associated with upstream suppliers that aren't typically part of a supplier evaluation processI think by using SOT if it could become a common model for a lot we can get those answers faster for those upstream suppliers she says if an organization can ask vendors to map it to their upstream suppliersMartin says the main challenges for SoT to become the go-to standard for supply chain assessments are enough bandwidth to expand the project as it catches on as well as getting the word out to avoid duplication of effort I'm worried about people not being aware of this and off trying to solve something that overlaps We are making sure people are aware and can help contribute to SoT he saysMITRE plans to offer RMM as an open source tool when it's fully baked For now Martin says organizations can use it to assist MITRE in fleshing out the tool itself or for their own internal use They can take it offline he says and do an assessment against the SoTCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place London SW1P

tech or marketing analytics tools But its the first provider to notify due to a vendors errorWhats more many of the marketing teams that employ these tools were unaware of the patient privacy risks For UCSD Health the analytics tool was placed on its scheduling websites for its Express Care and Urgent Care locations by its technology vendor Solv Health These websites let patients book provider appointments in-person and online However Solv placed analytics tools on the websites which captured and transmitted the data to its third-party service providersThe compromised data was tied to

reported the ILS hack as the largest healthcare data breach on record this year the incident in question was already reported to the Department of Health and Human Services last year The notice is simply an update to a previously recorded hackUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act covered entities must report any compromises of protected health information to HHS within 60 days of discovery However the time frame is not always long enough depending on the complexity of the attack and forensicsAs such entities commonly issue a notice describing the incident and note to patients that the investigation is ongoing while providing HHS with the current knowledge of the incident and reporting the incident as impacting 501 patients with the expectation theyll add more patients to the breach tallyAll signs suggest ILS did just that Reported by ILS on Sept 9 2022 an incident involving the inaccessibility of certain computer systems was detected on July 5 The response team found that a threat actor gained access to several ILS systems for nearly a week between June 30 and July 5 which enabled the exfiltration of some of the data stored on the impacted systemsOther information was accessible and potentially viewed according to the noticeAfter containing the incident ILS launched a review that concluded on Jan 17 2023 The team then validated the results and began

locations hosted on two domains webservice-srvonline and webservice-srv1onlineKnown attachment names redacted to remove personal informationWhen the potential victim activates the LNK file included in the ZIP file it triggers a chain of events that lead to the infection of the computer with a previously unseen malicious framework that we named CommonMagic The malware and techniques used in this campaign are not particularly sophisticated but are effective and the code has no direct relation to any known campaignsInfection chainInstallation workflowThe malicious LNK points to a remotely hosted malicious MSI file that is downloaded and started by the Windows Installer executableThe MSI file is effectively a dropper package containing an encrypted next-stage payload servicepackdat a dropper script runservicepackvbs and a decoy document that is supposed to be displayed to the victimFiles contained in attachmentmsiThe encrypted payload and the decoy document are written to the

with a simple XOR key 0x10Snippet of PowerMagics code containing the powermagic stringWhen started the backdoor creates a mutex WinEventCom Then it enters an infinite loop communicating with its CC server receiving commands and uploading results in response It uses OneDrive and Dropbox folders as transport and OAuth refresh tokens as credentialsEvery minute the backdoor performs the following actionsAs it turned out PowerMagic was not the only malicious toolkit used by the actor All the victims of PowerMagic were also infected with a more complicated previously unseen modular malicious framework that we named CommonMagic This framework was deployed after initial infection with the PowerShell backdoor leading us to believe that CommonMagic is deployed via PowerMagicThe CommonMagic framework consists of several executable modules all stored in the directory CProgramDataCommonCommand Modules start as standalone executable files and communicate via named pipes There are dedicated modules for interaction with the CC server encryption and decryption of the CC traffic and various malicious actionsThe diagram below illustrates the architecture of the frameworkFramework architectureA dedicated heartbeat thread updates the remote file victim IDSStxt every five minutes with the local timestamp of the victimThen in separate threads the network communication module downloads new executable modules from the directory victim IDM and uploads the results of their execution to the directory victim IDRThe data exchanged with the operator via the OneDrive location is encrypted using the RC5Simple open-source library By default this library uses the seven-byte sequence RC5SIMP at the beginning of the encrypted sequence but the developers of the backdoor changed it to Hwo7X8p Encryption is implemented in a separate process communicating over the pipes named pipePipeMd and pipePipeCrDtMdSo far we have discovered two plugins implementing the malicious business logic They are located in the directory CProgramDataCommonCommandOtherSo far we have found no direct links between the samples and data used in this campaign and any previously known actors However

        "text": "SideCopy APT is a Threat ActorTA from Pakistan that has been active since 2019 focusing on targeting South Asian nations especially India and Afghanistan The SideCopy APT gets its name from the infection chain which imitates that of the SideWinder APT Some reports suggest that this actor shares characteristics with Transparent Tribe APT36 and could potentially be a sub-group of that threat actorDRDO is a government agency tasked with researching and developing advanced technologies for use by the Indian Armed Forces Its focus includes creating cutting-edge defense systems such as missiles radars electronic warfare and communication systems naval and aerospace systems The agency plays a significant role in Indias defense industry contributing to the countrys military strength and self-sufficiency in defense technologyThe initial infection starts with a spam email containing the link to the malicious file hosted on the compromised website The link allows users to download a ZIP file containing a LNK file named DRDO K4 Missile Clean roompptxlnk from the below URLThe delivery mechanism of the SideCopy APT attack via a spam email is illustrated in the figure belowThe infection process begins with the user extracting a zip file and then running the lnk file on their machineOnce the lnk file is executed it triggers a command that launches mshtaexe to connect to a specific URL shown in the figure belowAfter redirection the URL eventually establishes a connection with the following URLSubsequently the hta file is downloaded and executed in the path mentioned belowThe figure below displays a code snippet from the pantomimehta file including the compressed Microsoft PowerPoint file encoded in Base64 formatAfter execution the hta file decodes and decompresses the PPT file encoded in Base64 format Consequently it saves the decompressed Microsoft PowerPoint file in the temp folder under the name DRDO K4 Missile Clean roompptx and launches it as shown in Figure 4 The TAs are enticing users with a DRDO PowerPoint document and covertly engaging in malicious activities in the background through the pantomimehta fileThe hta file aside from dropping the PPT file carries out a concatenation operation and decodes the Base64-encoded content of the DLL file named htadll When the decoding is complete the DLL file is loaded into memory and triggered using the DynamicInvoke method This method creates an instance of a class called WorkInProgressUpon execution the htadll file drops another hta file named jqueryhta under the directory CProgramDataHP and executes it through mshtaexeWhen executed the jqueryhta file carries out the concatenation operation and decodes the Base64-encoded content of the loader DLL file named PreBotHtadll as it did before for htadll Once decoded the PreBotHtadll file is loaded into the memory and invoked using the DynamicInvoke method This method creates an instance of a class called DraftingPadIt also uses a WMI query specifically Select From AntiVirus to gather the names of installed antivirus productsThe below figure shows the code snippet of jqueryhta fileFinally the jqueryhta file executes the PinkAgain function of the loader PreBotHtadll file passing AntiVirus names and a Base64 encoded payload called DUserdll as argumentsThe below figure shows the code snippet of the loaded PreBotHtadll fileThe PinkAgain function has code to copy the legitimate and essential credwizexe file which is a part of the Windows operating system and copies it to the following location as cridvizexe The legitimate file credwizexe is primarily used to create and restore Windows user account credentials backups Typically it loads a legitimate file named DuserdllHowever in this case the malware takes Base64 encoded argument decodes it and saves it as Duserdll in the location where cridvizexe was dropped previously The dropped malicious file Duserdll is a variant of the Action Rat Malware family responsible for performing malicious activities in the victims machine During its execution the loader drops both files in the below directoryFurthermore the loader utilizes various directories to drop the files credwizexe and DUserdll using different names based on the type of AntiVirus software installed on the victims machine TAs commonly use the tactic to increase the effectiveness of their attacks and avoid detection by security softwareThe specific directories and filenames used by the loader as indicated belowOnce the necessary files have been dropped onto the victims system the cridvizexe process is initiated which then proceeds to sideload the malicious payload Duserdll as shown in the figure belowTo begin its malicious operation the RAT first gathers information about the victims machine such as its hostname username operating system version and installed antivirus products This data is then transmitted to the Command-and-ControlCC server via HTTP request as belowAfterward the malicious process enters a loop and remains idle until it receives commands from the server which it executes The RAT possesses the ability to perform any of the following operations upon receiving commands from the CCIn addition the loader DLL was utilized to deploy a recently developed information-stealing malware called AuTo Stealer This malware can gather PDF documents Officetextdatabase files and images and transmit the stolen information via HTTP or TCPThis loader DLL file also drops a batch file named testbat in the temp directory which creates an auto startup entry for the cridvizexe file using the regexe utility as shown in the figure belowFigure 9 Run entry for PersistenceSideCopy is an APT group that emulates the tactics of the Sidewinder APT to distribute its own malware Its attack patterns typically involve the use of malicious LNK files to initiate a complex chain of infection using multiple HTAs and loader DLLs ultimately leading to the

deployed against healthcare apps hosted in Azure between Nov 18 2022 and Feb 17 2023 and found the attempts spiked from 10-to-20 attacks in November to 40 to 60 daily attacks in FebruaryDDoS attacks on healthcare organizations didnt demonstrate severely high throughput researchers wrote Several observed attacks hit 5 million packets per second pps but the majority of attacks fell below 2M ppsPharmaceuticals and life sciences industries were the primary targets at 31 of attacks followed by hospitals 26 and health insurance health service and care at 16 each These attacks although not extremely high could take down a website without proper DDoS security protection researchers explainedWeb apps and intertwined TCP and UDP were the primary attack vectors In several instances the researchers observed seven-layer DDoS attacks consuming many TCP connections and keeping them alive long enough trying to deplete memory state resources to render the application unavailable The attack method models previous attacks tied to KillnetIn another common attack method the DDoS will attempt to establish many new TCP connections over short intervals to hit CPU resourcesIn contrast to overall DDoS attack trends for 2022 in which TCP was the most common attack vector 53 of the attacks on healthcare were UDP floods and TCP accounted for 44 reflecting a different mixture of attack patterns used by adversaries on healthcareHC3 is urging healthcare entities to review tactics and recommended mitigation measures aimed to shore-up defenses against the ongoing threat of Black Basta First spotted in early 2022 the threat actors behind the variant are known for their use of double extortion tacticsThe threat groups prolific targeting of at least 20 victims in its first two weeks of operation indicates that it is experienced in ransomware and has a steady source of initial access according to the alert The group is also reluctant to recruit or advertise on dark web forumsAs such its believed the actors are seasoned cybercriminalsRather than rely on comprehensive spray-and-prey tactics the elusive group takes various precautions and relies on a more targeted approach calculatingly assessing its victims before compromise according to the alert Black Basta either excludes affiliates or only collaborates with a limited and trusted set of affiliatesIn its initial attacks Black Basta worked to purchase credentials for access to specific network targets The cunning operators will often use unique tactics to gain initial access before spreading laterally exfiltrating data and deploying ransomwareThe exploits enabled the group to cumulatively steal several gigabytes of data tied to personal information of healthcare customers and employees In only a short span of time by remaining under the radar Black Basta has conducted massive breaches in critical infrastructure across multiple countriesNotably the cross-platform ransomware is only executed with administrator privileges on both Windows and Linux systems the alert noted Once deployed the ransomware hinders machine processes and ultimately makes desktop files unusable before sending a ransom note to a victimThe actors have successfully exploited specific health IT websites theyve also disrupted healthcare industry services laboratory and pharmaceutical and health plan entitiesHC3 believes these attacks will continue to target unpatched critical vulnerabilities in the public health and healthcare systems which could have potentially life threatening impacts to critical infrastructureThe alert contains a long list of relevant defensive measures focused on multi-layered actions that can minimize exposures and potential ransomware impacts These tactics are not specific to Black Bastas custom tactics but include effective measures noted by security researchersThe ransomware-as-a-service RaaS model is a continuation of previous LockBit versions and all have highly effective tactics that hinder the effectiveness of computer network defenses and mitigationIn one instance LockBit 30 was observed accepting additional arguments for specific operations in lateral movement and rebooting into Safe Mode its code is password protected and affiliates without access to this model will be unable to execute the ransomwareThe CISA-FBI alert explains that the code protection helps evade detection and analysis as the code is un-executable and unreadable in its encrypted formThe actors behind the variant are still gaining access through remote desktop protocols RDPs drive-by compromise phishing attacks abuse of valid accounts and exploits of public-facing applicationsEntities are urged to prioritize patch management or network segmentation of known exploited vulnerabilities in addition to training users how to recognize and report phishing attacks and enforcing phishing-resistant multi-factor authenticationThe voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy

        "text": "On Feb 13 MKS discovered it was the victim of a ransomware attack which impacted business systems and delayed or disrupted the companys ability to process orders ship products and provide other services according to comments made by CEO John Lee in a Feb 28 earnings callA footnote claims that the plaintiff is filing under the name John Doe based on California laws that allows the use of pseudonyms in cases involving healthcare information in order to protect their privacy and prevent harassment of a healthcare patient The suit claims that by not adequately protecting that information MKS Instruments violated data protection requirements in the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act the California Consumer Privacy Act and other state laws It also claims that the company may have stored such data in an unencrypted state allowing hackers to make off with usable information that could lead to identity theft fraud and other threats for affected victimsThe lawsuit is seeking unspecified monetary damages and payment of attorney fees resulting from the incidentMKS had the resources necessary to protect and preserve confidentiality of Plaintiffs and the Class medical information and personal information in their possession but neglected to adequately implement data security measures as required by the CCPA and the CMIA despite their obligation to do so the complaint statesThe complaint cites a notification sent by MKS Instruments to the affected parties stating that the company was investigating the incident and could not rule out the possibility that personal data for employees and others may have been exfiltratedWhat data may have actually been stolen is unknown at this time but the universe of information potentially exposed is vast Among the information listed by the company were names contact information addresses government ID numbers work login credentials and passwords marital status veteran status nationality immigration status race religious beliefs education employment history dates of birth gender sexual orientation bank account information payment card information compensation and equity hours worked information about disabilities health and medical conditions health insurance information and children and emergency contacts The company reported it has taken on a variety of costs associated with the event including hiring of third-party consulting services forensic experts restoration experts legal counsel and other information technology and accounting professional expenses enhancements to our cybersecurity measures costs to restore systems and access data and employee-related expenses like increased overtimeTerry Dennehy vice president and senior credit officer for Moodys Investors Service said the ransomware attack and fallout was credit negative for the businessThe financial ramifications temporary manufacturing delays and the class action lawsuit underscore the potential cascading impacts of any cyber incident and the need to bolster cybersecurity across the industry Dennehy said in a statementThe filing also noted that its possible additional lawsuits or government sanctions could arise as a result of the attackWhile we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and any additional such lawsuits in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such proceedings we may incur losses associated with any such proceedings the company statedTyson Benson an intellectual property and cybersecurity attorney at ZF Group told SC Media that despite the fact that the lawsuit is being led by a former employee there are few specific allegations demonstrating direct negligence on the part of MKS Instruments While ransomware attacks typically involve the exfiltration of sensitive data the company's notice only said that such data may have been stolen Meanwhile the complaint doesn't offer any direct evidence that personal data was left unencrypted and that claim appears to be an inference on the part of the plaintiff's lawyers based on MKS' notification letterThere's no specific facts that the complaint points to This very well could be a situation where MKS had all their stuff exfiltrated trade secrets confidential information personal data of all their employees but we don't know that said Benson That's what discovery is for and that's what the argument would be but this is one of those cases that is lacking on specificsA call to one of the law firms representing the plaintiffs Cohelan Khoury and Singer was not returned by press time A

        "text": "A new malware botnet was discovered targeting Realtek SDK Huawei routers and Hadoop YARN servers to recruit devices into DDoS distributed denial of service swarm with the potential for massive attacksThe new botnet was discovered by researchers at Akamai at the start of the year who caught it on their HTTP and SSH honeypots seen exploiting old flaws such as CVE-2014-8361 and CVE-2017-17215Akamai comments that HinataBots operators initially distributed Mirai binaries while HinataBot first appeared in mid-January 2023 It seems to be based on Mirai and is a Go-based variant of the notorious strainAfter capturing multiple samples from active campaigns as recently as March 2023 Akamais researchers deduced that the malware is under active development featuring functional improvements and anti-analysis additionsThe malware is distributed by brute-forcing SSH endpoints or using infection scripts and RCE payloads for known vulnerabilitiesAfter infecting devices the malware will quietly run waiting for commands to execute from the command and control serverAkamai's analysts created a C2 of their own and interacted with simulated infections to stage HinataBot for DDoS attacks to observe the malware in action and infer its attack capabilitiesOlder versions of HinataBot supported HTTP UDP ICMP and TCP floods but the newer variants only feature the first two However even with only two attack modes the botnet can potentially perform very powerful distributed denial of service attacksWhile the HTTP and UDP attack commands differ they both create a worker pool of 512 workers processes that send hardcoded data packets to the targets for a defined durationThe HTTP packet size ranges between 484 and 589 bytes The UDP packets generated by HinataBot are particularly large 65549 bytes and consist of null bytes capable of overwhelming the target with a large traffic volumeHTTP floods generate large volumes of website requests while UDP flood sends large volumes of garbage traffic to the target hence the two methods attempt to achieve an outage using a different approachAkamai benchmarked the botnet in 10-second attacks for both HTTP and UDP and in the HTTP attack the malware generated 20430 requests for a total size of 34 MB The UDP flood generated 6733 packages totaling 421 MB of dataThe researchers estimated that with 1000 nodes the UDP flood could generate roughly 336 Gbps while at 10000 nodes the attack data volume would reach 33 TbpsIn the case of the HTTP flood 1000 ensnared devices would generate 2000000 requests per second while 10000 nodes would take that number of 20400000 rps and 27 GbpsHinataBot is still in development and might implement more exploits and widen its targeting scope anytime Furthermore the fact that its development is so active increases the likelihood of seeing more potent versions circulating in the wild soonLet's hope that the HinataBot authors move onto new hobbies before we have to deal with their botnet at any real scale"

        "title": "APT-C-36 from NjRAT to LimeRAT",
        "text": "The threat intelligence division of S2 GrupoMarch 15 2023This groups campaigns during the last quarter are summarised in the following imageThe diagram refers to the malware that is actually executed after the infection phase ie after successful deployment of the first stages of the infection process In fact it is a successful deployment which will allow the malware to be executed and which also allows the identification of TTPs prior to full compromiseGoing back to the previous image the following should be notedIn this post we are going back to the December 5 2022 campaign to explain in detail the deployment process of the malware in 5 stages observed until triggering NjRAT considering this campaign as a case study The objective is to show by means of a simplified comparison how the deployment for these RATs is very similar In addition It is provided a list of the IOCs of the previous campaigns a summary of the behaviour in communications and a comparison of the adaptations modifications made in the last campaign that triggers in LimeRATThe following picture shows the file appearance once it is opened using Microsoft wordThis group is characterised by the impersonation of official entities As it can be seen another of their characteristics is to keep a good level of appearance in the text and fake documents used in spear phishing campaignsThe document is revised to see which is the trigger of the infection finding a suspicious OLE object Object Linking and Embedding which in turn will lead to a WSF file Windows Script FileThe analysis is structured around the stages of the malware based on the previous resource The following image shows the summary of the stages identifiedThe final purpose of the malware in this case is the deployment of the remote access trojanRAT NjRAT but it is the way to such deployment that motivates the analysis which is described below a set of procedures that are in fact been maintained with little variation through the rest of campaings until the dateParticularly it should be noted that various stages of the malware deployment are produced entirely in memory making detection by antivirus tools more challengingThis article will address the deployment chain in five stages to then make a comparison between this operation and the last campaign in which LimeRat is deployed In addition findings regarding the behaviour of the campaigns with respect to the communications model are included Finally the indicators of compromise of the different campaigns are summarised for possible consultationAs anticipated in the 5th of december campaign the malicious file contains an OLE object whose properties are investigated inside a controlled environmentAs can be seen when the object is activated it will produce the execution of a WSF file Windows Script File Notificacin Jurdicawsf and thus triggering the infection in the machineWithout further complication at this point the files script can be extracted to do the analysisThe file has numerous repeated lines exactly the same to camouflage inside a piece of malicious codeBroadly speaking in the WSF file we can see the definition of a job in VBS language that through powershell will download a VBS file from the domain cdndiscordappcom and then launch it via Explorer The VBS script will later be deleted from the system This file is analysed belowTo carry on with the infection chain it is revised the VBS file downloaded to which allusion is made with the Debugvbs name because of its later reference in the code Indeed at this point of the execution this file can take any name depending also on the campaign The key issue here is that the script shows the appearance of a legitimate Microsoft WinRM fileHowever after a detailed analysis the section which triggers the malicious logic can be seenIn fact it can be seen that the code is obfuscated although after some operations it is possible to extract the original code it executesSpecifically an array of bytes in memory is declared to hold a PE file downloaded from the above IP after Base64 decoding This file corresponds to a DLL DLLPPAM and will be loaded into memory within the application domain of the current powershell process Subsequently the VAI method of the FiberHome class will be invoked by passing it as a parameter the URL written in reverse that can be seen at the end of the image This will cause it to execute in a fileless way making it more complicated to detect with antivirus toolsAs it has been indicated the first DLL injected in the powershell environment will be DLLPPAM FiberdllGoing into further detail DLLPPAM is a NET DLL with Yano protector 1XAfter reviewing the general properties of the DLL it can be observed the original name of the DLL FiberdllNo obfuscation or similar action by the protector is appreciatedFiberdll checks if the file CWindowsTempDebugvbs exists on the computer If so Fiberdll uses the name it was given in the previous step to refer to it If no such file exists it copies the vbs from the current path to the location mentioned under the name Debugvbs This file is the one that persists on the machine and the one that will be launched when the user session is started as seen in the persistence previouslyIt then performs a series of consecutive steps in an infinite loop to prepare and trigger the next stages of infectionIn particular it is observed that it downloads resources that will be used in the next phase of the infection Once the download is done it prepares the received data by reverting the obfuscated pathsSimilar to the previous block it also downloads the RAT that will eventually be deployed on the machine In this case the URL downloaded it is received as a parameter when invoking the DLL with a simple obfuscation reverse text It also constructs a path that will be used later to pass the value as a parameter in the next stageThe next step is to ensure persistence in a simple but functional wayAs can be seen the persistence is done by creating a link in the users Startup folder camouflaging itself under the guise of NotepadFinally it loads a payload injector obtained in the first download into the current application domain Once the base64 encoding has been decoded it invokes the Ande method of the Tools class of the FSociety module passing as arguments the path previously constructed from the NET path and the payload received from the second download after decoding the base64 encoding as wellAt this stage the malware is already operating with fileless files in memory In this case we focus on the second DLL that will be injected into powershell space rumpdll fsocietydll The hashes that define this artefact are listed belowThis is another unpacked NET DLL with the same protector Yano 1XAfter a static review of the binary it shows that the import of functions clearly associated with process injectionThe original name of this DLL is FsocietydllThe method used during the execution of the third phase will expect two parameters This function will be used to trigger the whole process of launching and injecting the final payload NjRATThis binary as we have seen above imports functions associated with the injectionmanagement of processessectionsthreads etc Therefore since they are not implemented within the C code the malware must import them from external libraries kernel32dll So as a result the following API functions are declared by the malwareThe main functionality of this binary is to inject NjRAT using the Process Hollowing technique as will be shown laterTo describe and clarify the behavior of the malicious dll the detailed steps performed by the malware until the injection becomes effective are shown below1- A legitimate suspended RegAsmexe process is created by calling to CreateProcess2- The GetThreadContext is obtained from the Regasmexe process previously created3- A call to ReadProcessMemory is made on RegAsmThis call reads 4 bytes from the PEB specifically the IBA Image Base Address of the RegAsm processThen it compares the IBA of the binary to be injected which has been previously obtained with the IBA of the victim process extracted from the call to ReadProcessMemory In case they are the same it makes a call to NTUnMapViewOfSection to unlink the section of the process memory4- A new memory section is reserved with VirtualAllocEx to hold the final NjRAT payloadAs can be seen 64KB of memory has been reserved under address 0x400000 with read write and execute RWX permissionsAt this point of the execution the content of this memory section remains empty5- A call is made to WriteProcessMemory on that section to proceed to complete that memory areaThrough this call only the first 512B of the PE header have been writtenThen using the BlockCopy method of the C Buffer class another part of the PE is copied to another byte array that will be used laterAnd finally the content of this new intermediate array is copied to the reserved section in RegAsmexe to complete the PE in memoryAnalogously to the previous one blockCopy WriteProcessMemory another part of the binary 1024Bytes is copied to the memory of the RegAsm processThis set of BlockCopy WriteProcessMemory calls will be carried out three more times until the total writing of the binary into memory is completed In total five BlockCopy WriteProcessMemory interactions were necessary to write the file completely into memory Possibly this is a measure to protect against AV detection in memory6- A call is made to SetThreadContext to set the new entry point to the thread7 And finally a call to ResumeThread is made to restart the execution of the new threadAt this point of the execution the RegAsm process stands out for its CPU consumption and observing the analysis of the generated traffic the connection attempt against the C2 of NjRAT every 2 seconds stands outNote The IP 19202123 is a simulated IP and does not correspond to the real IP to which prueba30novokduckdnsorg would resolveIn case any of the previous calls eg VirtualAllocEx fails to reserve memory in the victim process the victim process will be terminated and the whole injection chain will be started again from step 1 CreateProcessA closer look on the RegAsm process shows that NjRAT is indeed loaded in its memory and it is possible to find its configuration parametersFinally once the debugging of the process is finished it is observed that it does not depend on explorer and the powershell process that was in charge of launching the dll injector finished its execution being correctly injected NjRAT in the RegAsmexe processAs already mentioned the objective of this publication was to get to this point perhaps in the future we will delve into the analysis of NjRAT something that is not addressed on this occasion so as not to detract from the publicationIt should be noted that NjRAT has been triggered at this point but the operation could be maintained to trigger other malware and it is precisely in this operation where we wanted to keep the focusIn summary all APT-C-36 campaigns detected during the last quarter are collected here in table form The objective is to highlight the representative artifact type in each phase for the campaignsTaking into account that the first stage deals with the hook of the attack usually a file used for phishing with the camouflaged triggering device we can simplify the comparison by referring to the most representative files of the rest of the stages Althought for the different campaigns the vbs file of the second phase has a different name so far we have always identified a file with this extension that would be the protagonist in this stage which would load fiberdll and would be used for persistence On the other hand the DLLs of the third and fourth stage are kept as fiberdll and fsocietydll The name of these DLLs changes for the deployment of LimeRAT in which it should be noted that more obfuscation features are observedThis campaing starts with the file execution DOCUMENTO FGEvbsmd5 4cb86eadbadba68752d539597e6ab5adsha1 3e1682855ad4035134f6ebd68d56824535b4ca03sha256 b1b114c09344edc0be3459e3a93f47ef584df37b58500b7f420f8232e7cac6f5The image shows an obfuscation of the code to finally launch a powershell commandAfter some deofuscation operations the code that will be executed is obtainedAnd after removing the other layer of obfuscation you get to the code that powershell will finally runThe input method GzeUpA of the NET module KZUTPvWUGabK to be loaded into powershell memory is parsedThe same type of infinite loop is observed with a switch-case structure in which the program flow executes each and every one of the cases of the switch-caseIn this case the persistence in the machine will be done by copying the VBS file to the startup folderAdditionally a scheduled task will be created that will execute the previously created persistence file every minuteIt has been disabled in order to continue with the analysisNext both the DLL injector and the final payload in this case LimeRAT are downloaded The downloads and obfuscations are carried out in a similar way to the case studyFinally it will load in the memory of the powershell process the injector DLL and will invoke the PQHWQG method of the AGWNqjThUQsn class passing it as arguments the path of the binary where it will inject the final payload and the LimeRAT payload downloaded previouslyIn this case an obfuscation of the methods and variables of the loaded DLL is observedSimilarly the same structure of infinite loops is observed with switch-case structuresIt is noted that the defined extern are also obfuscated although the logic is similar to the detailed NjRAT case studySubsequently as in the case study the execution flow will be started which will use the process hollowing technique to inject the LimeRAT payload into the RegAsmexe processAs can be seen a new RegAsm process has been created in a suspended stateIn the following in order not to extend the article too much API calls have been omitted as they are similar to the case study detailed above The only difference is that they have an obfuscation layerA review of the memory of the RegAsm process shows that it has successfully injected the final payloadAnd as we can see once the call to ResumeThread happens the process has been correctly injected and some CPU consumption is observedA review of the generated traffic shows connection attempts to LimeRATs C2 approximately every 2 secNote The IP 19202123 is a simulated IP and does not correspond to the real IP to which prueba30novokduckdnsorg would resolveIn addition the creation of a mutex is observed in the processesThe LimeRAT config is extracted in memory from the RegAsm processFinally once the injector has finished running you can see that LimeRAT has been successfully injected and that the RegAsm process no longer depends on powershellThe analysis on the C2 infraestructures used by APT-C-36 until february 2023 are described in this section In summary it can be seen that in all six campaigns that all the C2 domains used have first resolved to an IP either from a VPN service or a Hosting serviceSubsequently it is observed that in four of the six campaings resolves to an IP associated to an ISP so as a hypothesis it is likely that the router is used as a reverse proxy to hide the real C2 See ref 1The data collected to reach the above conclusions are listed below in descending

SlovakiaRecently linked campaigns reveal that Winter Vivern has targeted Polish government agencies the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs the Italy Ministry of Foreign Affairs and individuals within the Indian government Of particular interest is the APTs targeting of private businesses including telecommunications organizations that support Ukraine in the ongoing warThe threat actors targeting of a range of government and private entities highlights the need for increased vigilance as their operations include a global set of targets directly and indirectly involved in the warWinter Viverns tactics have included the use of malicious documents often crafted from authentic government documents publicly available or tailored to specific themes More recently the group has utilized a new lure technique that involves mimicking government domains to distribute malicious downloadsIn early 2023 Winter Vivern targeted specific government websites by creating individual pages on a single malicious domain that closely resembled those of Polands Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Security Service of UkraineIn mid 2022 the attackers also made an interesting lesser observed use of government email credential phishing webpages One example is ocspdepcom which was used in targeting users of the Indian governments legitimate email service emailgovinLooking back at less recent activity we can see in December 2022 the group likely targeted individuals associated with the Hochuzhitcom I Want to Live project the Ukraine government

spreadsheet to infect the targetWhen the threat actor seeks to compromise the organization beyond the theft of legitimate credentials Winter Vivern tends to rely on shared toolkits and the abuse of legitimate Windows toolsWinter Vivern APT falls into a category of scrappy threat actors being quite resourceful and able to accomplish a lot with potentially limited resources while willing to be flexible and creative in their approach to problem-solvingRecent campaigns demonstrate the groups use of lures to initiate the infection process utilizing batch scripts disguised as virus scanners to prompt downloads of malware from attacker-controlled serversIn the case of malicious documents such as the Hochu Zhit themed XLS files PowerShell is called through a macro Specifically Invoke-Expression cmdlet is executed beaconing to the malicious destination of ocs-romastasseccomgoogcomredira3cf7ed34f8phpOne malware family of recent activity is APERETIF named by CERT-UA based on the development PDB path inside the sample We identified a related sample following similar use although it is less complete in malicious design These samples align with the theme of attacks mimicking a virus scanner presenting users with the fake scan results similar to the script loaders Known samples are PE32 executables written in Visual C with a compilation timestamp of May 2021 We assess the threat actor shifted from these original executables to the delivery of batch files with PowerShell scripting with overlap in their useAPERETIF is a trojan automating the collection of victim details maintaining access and beaconing outbound the actor-controlled domain marakanascom As with the previous script the trojan makes use of whomami within PowerShell in its initial activity to beacon outbound for further instructions andor downloadsAPERETIF also uses the signaturesphpid1 URI through HTTPS GET requests The group made use of compromised WordPress websites to host the malware such as with hxxpsapplesaltbeautycomwordpresswp-includeswidgetsclasswp521734i and hxxpsnatplycomwordpresswp-includesfontsch097214o serving as the download location for APERETIF during initial attack stagesMoreover Winter Vivern employs other intrusion techniques such as exploiting application vulnerabilities to compromise specific targets or staging servers An attacker-controlled server was found to host a login page for the Acunetix web application vulnerability scanner which may serve as a supplementary resource for scanning target networks and potentially used to compromise WordPress sites for malware hosting purposesThe Winter Vivern cyber threat actor whose operations of espionage have been discussed in this research has been able to successfully carry out their attacks using simple yet effective attack techniques and tools Their ability to lure targets into the attacks and their targeting of governments and high-value private businesses demonstrate the level of sophistication and strategic intent in their operations The dynamic set of TTPs and their ability to evade the public eye has made them a formidable force in the cyber domainGet notified when we post new contentThanks Keep an eye out for new contentIn the era of interconnectivity when markets geographies and jurisdictions merge in the melting pot of the digital domain the perils of the threat

the use of pseudonyms in cases involving healthcare information in order to protect their privacy and prevent harassment of a healthcare patient The suit claims that by not adequately protecting that information MKS Instruments violated data protection requirements in the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act the California Consumer Privacy Act and other state laws It also claims that the company may have stored such data in an unencrypted state allowing hackers to make off with usable information that could lead to identity theft fraud and other threats for affected victimsThe lawsuit is seeking unspecified monetary damages and payment of attorney fees resulting from the incidentMKS had the resources necessary to protect and preserve confidentiality of Plaintiffs

obligation to do so the complaint statesThe complaint cites a notification sent by MKS Instruments to the affected parties stating that the company was investigating the incident and could not rule out the possibility that personal data for employees and others may have been exfiltratedWhat data may have actually been stolen is unknown at this time but the universe of information potentially exposed is vast Among the information listed by the company were names contact information addresses government ID numbers work login credentials and passwords marital status veteran status

the potential cascading impacts of any cyber incident and the need to bolster cybersecurity across the industry Dennehy said in a statementThe filing also noted that its possible additional lawsuits or government sanctions could arise as a result of the attackWhile we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and any additional such lawsuits in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in such proceedings we may incur losses associated with any such proceedings the company statedTyson Benson an intellectual property and cybersecurity attorney at ZF Group told SC Media that despite the fact that the lawsuit is being led by a former employee there are few specific allegations demonstrating direct negligence on the part of MKS Instruments While ransomware attacks typically involve the exfiltration of sensitive data the company's notice only said that such data may have been stolen Meanwhile the complaint doesn't offer any direct evidence that personal data was left unencrypted and that claim appears to be an inference on the part of the plaintiff's lawyers based on MKS' notification letterThere's no specific facts that the complaint points to This very well could be a situation where MKS had all their stuff exfiltrated trade secrets confidential information personal data of all their employees but we don't know that said Benson That's what discovery is for and that's what

        "title": "Analysts Spot a Wave of SVB-Related Cyber Fraud Striking the Business Sector",
        "text": "Right now hackers are developing phishing campaigns that capitalize on the news of Silicon Valley Bank's failureSVB was the 16th-largest bank in the United States known primarily for servicing Silicon Valley startups and technology companies including such name brands as Buzzfeed Roblox Trustpilot and Roku A chain reaction beginning with global inflation and ending with a run on deposits saw regulators shut down the bank on FridayIndeed analysts have picked up on a wave of SVB-related attacks this week phishing and otherwise with dozens of new threats arising daily And unfortunately perfectly legitimate companies are actually unwittingly helping the attackers alongOren Koren CPO and co-founder of Veriti saw the data start to flow in right away Hackers started on March 10 and 11 buying domains that are very close to domains related to SVB he says The domains reference payments or a bailout or try to mimic legitimate SVB domains such as Benshiti says svblogincom and login-svbcom Sometimes hackers take a less tactful approach something like wefinancesvbclientscomKoren observed as the perpetrators having registered their lookalike domains created and tested their phishing attack flows Before you deploy you create a phishing process and then you test it on yourself to verify it works he explainsIn one case a malicious actor tipped their hand by clearly testing their infrastructure from Turkey That was a mistake and that's why we know he started there and then eventually moved to target the US he notes In all Koren has observed attacks from two major groups in addition to some smaller entitiesAs of this writing Veriti has tracked more than 62 new domains registered for SVB-related attacks and 200 phishing attacks in all primarily against targets in the United States understandable as most of SVB's clients are US-based companiesThe analysts who spoke with Dark Reading emphasized the many ways in which the public response to SVB is actually making hackers' jobs easierKoren made note of websites like affectedbysvbornotcom and svbmeltdownfyi which have been publishing lists of customers affected by SVB and how badly they were exposed It's important from a publication perspective he admits but for attackers those services allow them to know better whom they should target Attackers can use specific details from these websites to help legitimize their phishing emails or scale ransom payments according to how much money they see these companies stowing away in their coffersRyan Kalember executive vice president of cybersecurity strategy for Proofpoint points to an even more subtle problem As SVB customers shift to other banks they're having to inform clients and vendors about new channels for payments Those notifications sometimes aren't so distinguishable from phishingTake the perfectly honest email below a vendor notifying clients that due to SVB's failure payments should be sent to a new bank account As a result of that news it reads we are asking that with immediate effect your Company's payments that we previously directed be paid to Silicon Valley Bank now be paid in accordance with the attached letter from our Finance DepartmentSo actually the email is extremely unhelpful Kalember explains because even if it provides the right account details it looks so much like phishing from the language right on down to the minor details It even looks extremely malicious because of the docxpdfKalember had to deal with this payment problem first hand not just from a security analyst's perspective since his own company had limited exposure to SVB When notifying relevant clients he advises a more careful approach What the email should say is 'Please call us in a pre-recognized fashion to an official and indisputably legitimate phone number And we will discuss kind where we should go from a payment perspective going forward'To address the broader issue of SVB-related attacks Benishti highlighted the need for a security-forward culture and reviewing internal security processes Companies should also have robust systems in place he says to detect fake login pages and prevent credential harvesting which will be a featured play with SVB-related scamsKoren thinks the solution is even simpler He gave an example of one organization that's already targeted in an SVB phishing campaign They had anti-phishing in their mail security he points out alongside robust endpoint and network security solutions Unfortunately in this case their security was not maximized The phishing email got through They have all the technologies necessary to protect from those kinds of attacks they specifically just hadn't used it because they were not aware that they have a technology to do anti-phishingMost organizations Koren says are in a similar position So the goal is to maximize what you have from a security perspective or use automations and AI just to do that As SVB-related campaigns continue to rise companies will certainly need to maximize what security they already haveCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with

        "text": "Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community ESET ResearchESET Research uncovered a campaign by APT group Tick against a data-loss prevention company in East Asia and found a previously unreported tool used by the group14 Mar 2023 16 min readESET researchers discovered a campaign that we attribute with high confidence to the APT group Tick The incident took place in the network of an East Asian company that develops data-loss prevention DLP softwareThe attackers compromised the DLP companys internal update servers to deliver malware inside the software developers network and trojanized installers of legitimate tools used by the company which eventually resulted in the execution of malware on the computers of the companys customersBased on Ticks profile and the compromised companys high-value customer portfolio the objective of the attack was most likely cyberespionage How the data-loss prevention company was initially compromised is unknownKey points in this blogpostESET researchers uncovered an attack occurring in the network of an East Asian data-loss prevention company with a customer portfolio that includes government and military entitiesESET researchers attribute this attack with high confidence to the Tick APT groupThe attackers deployed at least three malware families and compromised update servers and tools used by the company As a result two of their customers were compromisedThe investigation revealed a previously undocumented downloader named ShadowPyIn March 2021 through unknown means attackers gained access to the network of an East Asian software developer companyThe attackers also compromised update servers which delivered malicious updates on two occasions to machines inside the network of the DLP company Using ESET telemetry we didnt detect any other cases of malicious updates outside the DLP companys networkThe customer portfolio of the DLP company includes government and military entities making the compromised company an especially attractive target for an APT group such as TickAccording to ESET telemetry in March 2021 the attackers deployed malware to several machines of the software developer company The malware included variants of the Netboy and Ghostdown families and a previously undocumented downloader named ShadowPyIn April the attackers began to introduce trojanized copies of the Q-dir installers in the network of the compromised companyIn June and September 2021 in the network of the compromised company the component that performs updates for the software developed by the compromised company downloaded a package that contained a malicious executableIn February and June 2022 the trojanized Q-dir installers were transferred via remote support tools to customers of the compromised companyFigure 1 Timeline of the attack and related incidentsThe first incident where an update containing malware was registered was in June and then again in September 2021 On both cases the update was delivered to machines inside the DLP companys networkThe update came in the form of a ZIP archive that contained a malicious executable file It was deployed and executed by a legitimate update agent from software developed by the compromised company The chain of compromise is illustrated in Figure 2Figure 2 Illustration of the chain of compromiseThe first detected case occurred in June 2021 and the update was downloaded from an internal server and deployed The second case occurred in September 2021 from a public-facing serverThe malicious executable issues an HTTP GET request to http103127124117indexhtml to obtain the key to decrypt the embedded payload which is encrypted with the RC6 algorithm The payload is dropped to the TEMP directory with a random name and a vbe extension and is then executedUsing ESET telemetry we didnt identify any customers of the DLP company who had received any malicious files through the software developed by that company Our hypothesis is that the attackers compromised the update servers to move laterally on the network not to perform a supply-chain attack against external customersQ-Dir is a legitimate application developed by SoftwareOK that allows its user to navigate four folders at the same time within the same window as shown in Figure 3 We believe that the legitimate application is part of a toolkit used by employees of the compromised company based on where the detections originated inside the networkFigure 3 Screenshot of the Q-Dir applicationAccording to ESET telemetry starting in April 2021 two months before the detection of the malicious updates the attackers began to introduce 32- and 64-bit trojanized installers of the application into the compromised companys networkWe found two cases in February and June 2022 where the trojanized installers were transferred by the remote support tools helpU and ANYSUPPORT to computers of two companies located in East Asia one in the engineering vertical and the other a manufacturing industryThese computers had software from the compromised company installed on them and the trojanized Q-dir installer was received minutes after the support software was installed by the usersOur hypothesis is that the customers of the compromised DLP company were receiving technical support from that company via one of those remote support applications and the malicious installer was used unknowingly to service the customers of the DLP company it is unlikely that the attackers installed support tools to transfer the trojanized installers themselvesThe technique used to trojanize the installer involves injecting shellcode into a cavity at the end of the Section Headers table the application was compiled using 0x1000 for FileAlignment and SectionAlignment leaving in a cavity of 0xD18 bytes large enough to accommodate the

TEMPChromeUpexe by default if the file cannot be created it gets a new name using the GetTempFileNameA APIFigure 5 Decompiled code of the function that orchestrates downloading the binary file and writing it to diskWhile only one malicious 32-bit installer was found the 64-bit installers were detected in several places throughout the DLP companys network The installer contains the Q-Dir application and an encoded VBE ReVBShell backdoor that was customized by the attackers both of them were compressed with LZO and encrypted with RC6 The files are dropped in the TEMP directory and executedReVBShell is an open-source backdoor with very basic capabilities The backdoor code is written in VBScript and the controller code is written in Python Communication with the server is over HTTP with GET and POST requestsThe backdoor supports several commands includingWe believe that the attackers used ReVBShell version 10 based on the main branch commit history on GitHubIn this section we provide more details about tools and malware families that Tick deployed in the compromised software companys networkTo maintain persistent access the attackers deployed malicious loader DLLs along with legitimate signed applications vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking The purpose of these DLLs is to decode and inject a payload into a designated process in all cases of this incident all loaders were configured to inject into svchostexeThe payload in each loader is one of three malware families ShadowPy Ghostdown or Netboy Figure 6 illustrates the loading processFigure 6 High-level overview of the Tick malware loading processIn this report we will focus on analyzing the ShadowPy downloader and Netboy backdoorBased on our findings we believe the malware was developed at least two years before the compromise of the DLP company in 2021 We have not observed any other incidents where ShadowPy was deployedAs previously described the malicious DLL loader is launched via DLL side-loading in the case of ShadowPy we observed vssapidll being side-loaded by avshadowexe a legitimate software component from the Avira security software suiteThe loading chain is illustrated in Figure 7Figure 7 High-level overview of the steps taken to execute the PYC payloadThe PYC code is a simple downloader whose purpose is to retrieve a Python script and execute it in a new thread This downloader randomly picks a URL from a list although for the samples we analyzed only one URL was present and builds a unique ID for the compromised machine by building a string composed of the following dataFinally it uses abszlibcrc32STRING to generate the value that will serve as an ID The ID is inserted in the middle of a string composed of random characters and is further obfuscated then it is appended to the URL as shown in Figure 8Figure 8 Decompiled Python code that prepares the URL appending the obfuscated unique user IDNetboy communicates with its CC server over TCP The packet format used to exchange information between the backdoor and its CC is described in Figure 9Figure 9 Illustration of the CC packet format implemented by NetboyIn order to fingerprint its packets it generates two random numbers first two fields in the header that are XORed together as shown in Figure 10 to form a third value that is used to validate the packetFigure 10 Decompiled code that generates two random numbers and combines them to generate a packet fingerprint valuePacket validation is shown in Figure 11 when the backdoor receives a new command from its controllerFigure 11 Decompiled code that performs validation of a newly received packetThe packet header also contains the size of the encrypted compressed data and the size of the uncompressed data plus the size DWORD of another field containing a random number not used for validation that is prepended to the data before it is compressed as shown in Figure 12Figure 12 Decompiled code that creates a new packet to be sent to the controllerFor compression Netboy uses a variant of the LZRW family of compression algorithms and for encryption it uses the RC4 algorithm with a 256-bit key made up of ASCII charactersNetboy supports 34 commands however in Table 1 we describe only 25 of the most prominent ones giving the attackers certain capabilities on the compromised systemsTable 1 Most interesting

previously attributed to Tick and to the best of our knowledge has not been shared with other APT groups and the code similarities between ShadowPy and the loader used by NetboyWe believe that campaign is likely to be related to the attack described in this report as the custom ReVBShell backdoor of both attacks is the same and there are multiple code similarities between the malicious 64-bit installer SHA-1 B9675D0EFBC4AE92E02B3BFC8CA04B01F8877DB6 and the quartzdll sample SHA-1 ECC352A7AB3F97B942A6BDC4877D9AFCE19DFE55 described by AhnLabESET researchers uncovered a compromise of an East Asian data loss prevention company During the intrusion the attackers deployed at least three malware families and compromised update servers and tools used by the compromised company As a result two customers of the company were subsequently compromisedOur analysis of the malicious tools used during the attack revealed previously undocumented malware which we named ShadowPy Based on similarities in the malware found during the investigation we have attributed the attack with high confidence to the Tick APT group known for its cyberespionage operations targeting the APAC regionWe

National Cyber Security Centre-Estonia NCSC-EE told The Record that his team had been in a heightened awareness level for two weeks during the campaign and that attempts to enter the electoral system were unsuccessfulThere's no point in calling for a press conference and going and saying that this happened Nothing out of the ordinary happened nothing happened that hasn't happened the week before or the week before that Weve been in sort of a cyber Im not going to use war but we've been under a massive wave of attacks for a year nowWe went into a raised level we have Alpha Bravo Charlie so we went into Bravo last year in January and we haven't lowered it We dont know when we'll go back to green to all calm It's not calm said AuvrtHe declined to offer a detailed description of the attacks but he stressed that they werent successful They covered a wide range of recognized threat actor behavior he saidWe see now the Russian attacks actually they are not attributed officially so maybe I cant say this so openly but the attacks on our systems we see that they are learning Kallas said They see that OK these things are not going through so they are improving and constantly trying new ways to really undermine our systemEstonia is recognised among NATO allies as an authority on Russia Its foreign intelligence service was praised highly by Sir Richard Moore the chief of the UKs MI6 at the Aspen Institute last year I mean gosh pound-for-pound they probably knock us into a cocked hatDespite almost a quarter of Estonias 13 million inhabitants being ethnic Russians there is no significant sympathy for the invasion of Ukraine among its political partiesThe Centre Party historically the most popular among Russian-speaking Estonians received 28 fewer votes than it received in the 2019 election The main opposition party the nationalist EKRE which criticized military equipment being sent to Ukraine also received fewer votes than beforeThe exterior of the Riigikogu or parliament of Estonia in the capital Tallinn Image Scotch Mist Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 40NCSC-EEs Auvrt said We are no different than any other country going through elections Always there are attempts at interference ranging from information operations to distributed-denial-of-service DDoS attacks and phishing campaignsThe attempts this month didn't hinder or have any effect on the election process itself either the paper balloting going on or the internet-based voting said Auvrt adding that attempts to break into the system and to try and manipulate it were not just part of the election cycle but constantEstonia has faced massive waves of cyberattacks over the past year he added a period during which Estonia has provided more military equipment to Ukraine as a proportion of its GDP per capita than any other nationEach of these waves followed a moment of political tension between Estonia and Russia such as when Estonias Parliament decided to formally describe Russia as a terrorist state and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a remote address to Estonias politiciansBack in 2007 just a few years after joining NATO Estonia was impacted by a wave of cyberattacks when it relocated a Soviet war memorial from the center of the capital Tallinn to a military cemetery a few kilometers away Officials blamed Russia for the incidentsThe digital attempts to hobble the country were groundbreaking They showed what a nation could face as a result of cyber hostilities and prompted a major research effort into cyberwarfare at NATO eventually leading to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence being founded in Tallinn in 2008Whatever daily business you conduct that irritates their worldview or their perception of things immediately there is a response and the response usually is in this massive wave of DDoS attacks said AuvrtDDoS attacks against Estonian government websites including the parliamentary website and the presidents website continued throughout the election he said These attacks attempted to take the websites offline by sending too many requests for the servers to handle meaning authentic attempts to load the page went unansweredWhile DDoS attacks can use different communications protocols to prevent a server from responding to legitimate requests the Estonian incidents were typically application layer or Layer 7 attacks using HTTP requests the type used to load a web browser page While they were not technically sophisticated attacks the scale was surprising said AuvrtFor the first quarter of last year we were the seventh most targeted country on the planet Were a country of 13 million people so like a suburb of London population-wise If you put that into perspective then it shows the level of interest of some people who want to put the emphasis here on Estonia with their attacks he addedIts not the highest on the planet but its just to put it bluntly its weird to want to try that much to get the system down Where the moment of pride comes of course is in the fact that we maintained our systems up and running Auvrt addedAuvrt told The Record there's more variety than just the two options that you listed regarding botnet or paid-infrastructure DDoS trafficWe know who is behind them and we have the data to go down the rabbit hole and see where it originated But we're not in the business of attribution he said It's not our goal first of all and secondly this is exactly what they're looking for Look what we did look where we succeeded so we don't specifically voice out publicly whoever it

that in accordance with the Federal Communications Commission federal law enforcement has already been informed about CPNIs improper accessThe vulnerability has been patched according to ATT as well This most recent hack is the first of its kind that ATT has experienced in a long time and is evidence that Hackers constantly develop new techniques for committing fraud and identity theftCyberattacks in the telecom sector are on the rise and numerous security researchers forecast that they will become a significant issue in 2023 This is especially true given the growing adoption of IoT devices the push toward 5G and the geopolitical context in which telecom companies serve as vital national infrastructureTelecommunications businesses have already reported a number of cyber security problems within the first three months of the year On January 6 a threat actor claimed to have discovered 37 million ATT customer records on a third-party vendors insecure cloud storage The threat actor distributed a sample of 5 million recordsCiting a hack on a marketing vendor in January ATT is informing about 9 million customers that some of their personal data were made available Network Customer Proprietary The number of lines on some cellular accounts or wireless rate plans for example were made public According to ATT There were no account passwords Social Security Numbers

related to eligibility for device upgradesSeeing ATT experiencing a data breach involving a third-party company is a wakeup call for all businesses and highlights the need to revisit supply chains for security weak links The fact that customer names email addresses and phone numbers were amongst the leaked data creates huge potential for tailored social engineering attacks and identity

party dealing with sensitive data or accessing your network does so in the right way tooTo limit the impact of these attacks businesses that hold private information should ensure they have clearly defined security policies and procedures to avoid any leak of information This starts with employee education which underscores all effective cyber resilience and data protection strategies Security

        "text": "--ListenShareResearch by Gianluca TiepoloAPT29 is a highly sophisticated Advanced Persistent Threat APT group that has been attributed to Russias Foreign Intelligence Service SVR The group has been active since at least 2008 and has been involved in a wide range of espionage and cyber-attack campaigns targeting governments military organizations defense contractors and various industries in the United States Europe and AsiaAPT29 is also known as NOBELIUM Microsoft Cozy Bear Crowdstrike The Dukes Kaspersky JACKMACKEREL iDefense BlueBravo Recorded Future and UNC2452 FireEyeThe group is known for its subtle and sophisticated tradecraft in stealing geopolitical intelligence unlike other Russian state-sponsored groups such as APT28 or Sandworm APT29 has not been linked to destructive operations and operates with much more discretionThe group has been attributed to a number of high-profile cyberattacks includingIn May 2021 it was revealed that APT29 was responsible for a large-scale cyberattack on multiple US government agencies and private companies including Microsoft The group used a compromised email marketing system to send spear-phishing emails to over 3000 individual accounts resulting in the installation of a backdoor that allowed the attackers to gain access to the victims networks The group has also been linked to other significant cyberattacks including the theft of COVID-19 research from US-based pharmaceutical companiesOverall APT29 is one of the most sophisticated and well-resourced APT groups in the world and its TTPs are constantly evolving and changingAPT29 is known for its patient and persistent targeting of its victims often using multi-stage attacks that take weeks or even months to complete Following is a list of the groups most notable TTPsIn this particular research I focused on analyzing APT29s command-and-control capabilitiesThis threat group has a history of using trusted and legitimate cloud services such as social media services and Google Drive for their cyber attacks in an attempt to blend into normal network traffic and evade detection Malware distributed by APT29 also contains the ability to exfiltrate data over those same C2 channels For exampleAPT29 has also utilized custom encryption methods such as those found in the groups SeaDuke malware where a unique fingerprint was generated for the infected host and Base64 encoding and RC4AES encryption was used to layer data during communications with their C2 server The group has also employed techniques such as domain fronting and TOR obfuscation plugins to create encrypted network tunnelsUsing social networks for C2 communications is not an entirely new technique other Russian groups such as Turla Venomous Bear leveraged comments posted to Instagram to obtain the address of its command and control serversAPT29 was spotted using Twitter to control infected machines as early as 2015 in the HAMMERTOSS campaign the group was able to receive commands and send stolen data through the popular social network which allowed them to evade detection by security solutions that did not monitor social media trafficIn a more recent campaign dating back to June 2021 APT29 targeted Italy diplomatic organizations with a spear phishing campaign that distributed the EnvyScout backdoorThe backdoor first calls a function to create a custom Slack channel adding the attackers user ID to the newly created channel The backdoor gets the user name and hostname of the victim host adds 4 random numbers to form the name of the channel and sends an HTTP request with an authorization token to the Slack API After the channel is established the backdoor enters an infinite loop it uses the chatpostMessage API request to send a beacon message to the newly created channel and it receives a response with a list of additional files and payloads that are downloaded and executed on the target machineIn mid-January 2022 APT29 launched yet another spear phishing campaign targeting a diplomatic entity which was detected and responded to by Mandiant During the investigation Mandiant discovered that the malicious emails were used to distribute the BEATDROP and BOOMMIC downloadersBEATDROP is a downloader written in C that leverages Trello for Command-and-Control C2 communication Trello is a web-based project management application that allows users to organize tasks and projects using customizable boards lists and cardsWhen executed BEATDROP maps its own copy of ntdlldll into memory to execute shellcode in its own process It creates a suspended thread then enumerates the system for the username computer name and IP address to create a victim ID This victim ID is used by BEATDROP to store and retrieve victim payloads from its C2 Once the victim ID is created BEATDROP sends an initial request to Trello to determine if the current victim has already been compromised The shellcode payload is then retrieved from Trello and is targeted for each victim Once the payload has been retrieved it is deleted from TrelloNotion API can be abused for C2 communications by embedding the commands into the Notion workspace which is accessed by the malware as if it were a legitimate user This misuse of Notion allows the threat actors to evade detection and bypass security controls as the traffic between the malware and the Notion server is likely to be perceived as legitimate trafficAccording to Recorded Future APT29 utilized a compromised website with a lure text of Ambassadors schedule November 2022 to distribute the ZIP file schedulezip suggesting that the targets of the campaign are related to embassy staff or an ambassador GraphicalNeutrino the malware used in the operation serves as a loader with basic C2 capabilities and employs various anti-analysis techniques to avoid detection including API unhooking and sandbox evasionAfter establishing persistence the malware decrypts several strings including a Notion API key and a database identifier and calculates a unique ID for the victim based on their username and hostname It then uses Notions API for C2 communication to deliver additional payloads to the victims machineFor each request to the C2 GraphicalNeutrino parses the JSON-formatted response and searches for a file array if the array is not empty then the malware will parse out the URL field download the file and decrypt it using a custom cipher Once the shellcode is decrypted it is indirectly spawned in a new threadThe use of diplomatic lures during times of heightened geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing war in Ukraine is likely to be effective for Russian APT groups given the potential impact of information gathered from compromised entities or individuals on Russian foreign policy and strategic decision-making processes It is perhaps for this reason that APT29 adopted the same tactics in particular the stealthy C2 communication through Notion for its next big campaign this time targeting the European CommissionBeginning mid-February 2023 a spear phishing campaign targeted a number of email addresses related to members of the European Commission The attack involved the distribution of a malicious iso image that contained a new sample of the VaporRage downloader Once executed the malware was observed exploiting the Notion API to deploy Cobalt Strike beaconsThe first phishing email sent on the 13th February 2023 masqueraded as an administrative notice related to documents available to download from eTrustEx a web based exchange platform that ensures secure transmission of documents between members of the Commission The decoy emails are written in English and were delivered to an extremely targeted number of key people that use the eTrustEx platformIn addition I noticed that in different samples of the email the senders are probably compromised email accounts belonging to legitimate government organizations This could lead victims to believe that the emails came from reliable partners making it more likely for recipients to click on the linksThe ISO file is set to auto-download when the website is visited by the victim this is achieved through the following JavaScript code The contents of Instructionsiso is stored in the d variableOnce the file has been written to disk when a user double-clicks on it in Windows 10 or later the image is mounted and the folder contents is displayed in Windows Explorer The ISO contains two files a Windows shortcut file Instructionslnk and a malicious DLL BugSplatRc64dllIf the user clicks on the LNK file the following command runs unintentionally triggering the execution of the malicious DLLWhen executed with the InitiateDs export VaporRage first runs a few reconnaissance commands and generates a host-id by hex-encoding the DNS domain and username Then it creates a copy of itself atCUsersUSERNAMEAppDataLocalDsDiBacksBugSplatRc64dllVaporRage then establishes persistence on the compromised system by creating a registry run key located at SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunDsDiBacksAs I anticipated at the start of this post the VaporRage sample delivered in the execution chain leverages its command-and-control by communicating over HTTPS using Notion APIs Notions database feature is also used to store victim information and stage further payloads for downloadBased on my observations this VaporRage sample periodically executes a POST request to the Notion API to check the availability of a second-stage malware payload which is then retrieved and executed in memory In this particular campaign APT29 used VaporRage to distribute Cobalt Strike beacons to further establish a foothold within the environmentFollowing is a sample POST request towards apinotioncom 104184299Overall the use of cloud services such as Trello and Notion for C2 communications not only provides a threat actor with increased capabilities for evasion of network security controls but also increases resilience to law enforcement takedowns social media and cloud services are often hosted on multiple servers and locations making it more difficult for authorities to take down the entire platform This means that the threat actor can continue to use the platform for C2 communications even if some servers are taken down These advantages make it an attractive option for threat groups such as APT29 to conduct their malicious activitiesThe range of tactics techniques and procedures TTPs used by APT29 in this campaign supports the conclusion that their objective is to establish numerous means of long-term access to facilitate espionage-related intelligence gathering within the targeted government entities victim networks Nations that have a connection to the Ukraine crisis specifically those with significant geopolitical economic or military ties to Russia or Ukraine face a heightened risk of being targeted by APT29This threat group has shown an impressive ability to adapt swiftly during their operations They use innovative and unique methods to circumvent detection and authentication requirements in their target environments In their recent operations the group has demonstrated a deep understanding of operational security enabling them to move seamlessly between on-premises and cloud resources with minimal use of malware These factors combined with their advanced malware development skills long history of operations and extended time on targets indicate that APT29 is a well-funded and exceptionally sophisticated actor and will definitely continue to be a threat during 2023Following is a list of indicators associated to this campaignDomains

        "text": "Researchers at the School of Cyber Security at Korea University Seoul have presented a new covert channel attack named CASPER can leak data from air-gapped computers to a nearby smartphone at a rate of 20bitssecThe CASPER attack leverages the internal speakers inside the target computer as the data transmission channel to transmit high-frequency audio that the human ear cannot hear and convey binary or Morse code to a microphone up to 15m awayThe receiving microphone can be in a smartphone recording sound inside the attacker's pocket or a laptop in the same roomResearchers have previously developed similar attacks leveraging external speakers However air-gapped network-isolated systems used in critical environments such as government networks energy infrastructure and weapon control systems are unlikely to have external speakersOn the other hand internal speakers that provide audio feedback such as boot-up beeps are still considered necessary so they're commonly present making them better candidatesAs is the case with almost all secret channel attacks targeting network-isolated computers a rogue employee or a stealthy intruder with physical access to the target must first infect it with malwareAlthough this scenario may seem impractical or even far-fetched there have been multiple instances of such attacks being successfully carried out in the past with notable examples including the Stuxnet worm which targeted Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz the AgentBTZ malware that infected a US military base and the Remsec modular backdoor which secretly collected information from air-gapped government networks for over five yearsThe malware can autonomously enumerate the target's filesystem locate files or file types that match a hardcoded list and attempt to exfiltrate themMore realistically it can perform keylogging which is more suitable for such a slow data transmission rateThe malware will encode the data to be exfiltrated from the target in binary or Morse code and transmit it through the internal speaker using frequency modulation achieving an imperceptible ultrasound in a range between 17 kHz and 20 kHzThe researchers experimented with the described model using a Linux-based Ubuntu 2004 computer as the target and a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 as the receiver running a basic recorder application with a sampling frequency of up to 20 kHzIn the Morse code experiment the researchers set the length per bit to 100 ms and used 18 kHz for dots and 19 kHz for the dash The smartphone was located 50cm away and was able to decode the sent word covertIn the binary data experiment the length per bit was set to 50 ms transferring zeros at a frequency of 18 kHz and 1s at 19 kHz A 50 ms startend bit was also used at 17 kHz to indicate the beginning of a new messageBased on the conducted tests the maximum distance of the receiver is 15 meters 49 ft using a length per bit of 100 msThe overall results of the experiment however show that the length per bit affects the bit error rate and a maximum reliable transmitting bit rate of 20 bitss is achievable when the length per bit is 50 msAt this data transfer rate the malware could transmit a typical 8-character length password in about 3 seconds and a 2048-bit RSA key in 100 secondsAnything above that like a small 10 KB file for example would need over an hour to exfiltrate from the air-gapped system even if the conditions are ideal and no interruptions occur during the transmissionAsolution to the slow data rate would beto vary the frequency band for multiple simultaneous transmissions however internal speakers can only produce sound in a single frequency band so the attack is practically limitedThe researchers shared ways to defend against the CASPER attack with the simplest being toremove the internal speaker from mission-critical computersIf that's impossible defenders could implement a high-pass filter to keep all generated frequencies within the audible sound spectrum blocking ultrasound transmissions"

us and our mission to help organizations defend against cyber crimeWhen conducting phishing operations UNC2970 engaged with targets initially over LinkedIn masquerading as recruiters Once UNC2970 contacts a target they would attempt to shift the conversation to WhatsApp where they would continue interacting with their target before sending a phishing payload that masqueraded as a job description In at least one case UNC2970 continued interacting with a victim even after the phishing payload was executed and detected asking for screenshots of the detectionThe C2 servers utilized by UNC2970 for remote template injection have primarily been compromised WordPress sites a trend observed in other UNC2970 code families as well as those used by other DPRK groups At the time of analysis the remote template was no longer present on the C2 however following this phishing activity Mandiant identified it beaconing to a C2 associated with PLANKWALKIn addition to functioning as a legitimate TightVNC viewer LIDSHIFT contained multiple hidden features The first was that upon execution by the user the malware would send a beacon back to its hardcoded C2 the only interaction this needed from the user was the launching of the program This lack of interaction differs from what MSTIC observed in their recent blog post The initial C2 beacon from LIDSHIFT contains the victims initial username and hostnameLIDSHOT sends the following information back to its C2In multiple investigations Mandiant has observed UNC2970 deploy PLANKWALK to establish footholds within environments PLANKWALK is a backdoor written in C that communicates over HTTP and utilizes multiple layers of DLL sideloading to execute an encrypted payload PLANKWALK is initially executed through a launcher that will import and execute a second stage launcher expected to be on diskObserved First Stage Launcher namesOnce loaded and executed the secondary launcher will attempt to decrypt and execute an encrypted PLANKWALK sample on disk that matches the following patternCProgramDataMicrosoftVaultcachethree numerical digitsdbOnce executed PLANKWALK will decrypt an on-host encrypted configuration file that contains the C2 for the backdoor The C2 for PLANKWALK has largely been co-opted by legitimate WordPress sitesFollowing the deployment of PLANKWALK Mandiant observed UNC2970 leverage a wide variety of additional tooling including Microsoft InTune to deploy a shellcode downloaderDuring their operations Mandiant has observed UNC2970 use a wide range of custom post-exploitation tooling to achieve their goals One of UNC2970's go-to tools has been a dropper tracked as TOUCHSHIFT TOUCHSHIFT allows UNC2970 to employ follow-on tooling that range from keyloggers and screenshot utilities to full featured backdoorsTOUCHSHIFT is a malicious dropper that masquerades as mscoreedll or netplwixdll TOUCHSHIFT is typically created in the same directory and simultaneously as a legitimate copy of a Windows binary TOUCHSHIFT leverages DLL Search Order Hijacking to use the legitimate file to load and execute itself TOUCHSHIFT has been observed containing one to two various payloads which it executes in-memory Payloads that have been seen include TOUCHSHOT TOUCHKEY HOOKSHOT TOUCHMOVE and SIDESHOWTo appear legitimate the file uses over 100 exports that match common system export names However the majority all point to the same empty function The malicious code has been seen located in exports LockClrVersion or UsersRunDllW in different instancesWhen TOUCHSHIFT contains a second payload it takes a single character command line option as its first argument to determine which of the two payloads to executeTo unpack its payloads TOUCHSHIFT generates a decryption key by XOR encoding its second argument and the first 16 characters of the legitimate executables file nameFor example in one instance Mandiant observed the arguments -CortanaUIFilter XOR encoded with the hardcoded key 009WAYHb90687PXkS and printfilterpipel which was XOR encoded with the hardcoded key sV58lypQ and was loaded by the file printfilterpipelinesvcexe In another instance the argument used was --forkavlauncher and the loading file was CwindowsBrandingNetplwizexeOnce the code is unpacked it is then loaded into a memory location created by a call to VirtualAlloc and executed from thereOnce the payloads hashave been executed the main portion of TOUCHSHIFT will sleep for a period of time allowing the payloads to continue executingTOUCHSHOT will create a file in the CUsersuserAppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsThemes directory and will name the file DMPdat where the four numbers are pseudo-randomly generated Once TOUCHSHOT has generated the file name it attempts to create a handle to the file If the return value indicates that the file does not exist it will then create the file This check is performed as part of a loop that continues until a new file needs to be created After each iteration of the loop TOUCHSHOT will then take a screenshot which is appended to the staging fileTOUCHKEY creates two files in the CUsersuserAppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsTemplates directory The file name Normaldost is used for storing the captured keystrokes while the file name Normaldocb is used for the clipboard data The full paths are then passed into their own thread where the keystrokes or clipboard data will be captured and appended to their respective filesIn one of the created threads TOUCHKEY will open the clipboard and grab the data that is stored within it In the other thread TOUCHKEY will set a hook into the keyboard and record any keys that are pressedHOOKSHOT takes an encoded argument containing two IP and port pairs which it will leverage for communicating with its C2HOOKSHOT will then create a socket using these two IP addresses and tunnel traffic across them utilizing TLSv10TOUCHMOVE is a loader that decrypts a configuration file and a payload both of which must be on disk and then executes the payload TOUCHMOVE generates an RC6 key to decrypt the two files by querying the systems BIOS date version manufacturer and product name Once decrypted the results are XOR encoded with a hardcoded key If the generated RC6 key is incorrect the configuration and payload files will not successfully decrypt indicating that UNC2970 compiles instances of TOUCHMOVE after having already conducted reconnaissance on the target victim system Once the RC6 key is successfully generated a handle is created to the configuration file and the decryption process is conducted If the configuration file is successfully decrypted the payloads full path is located within it and the same decryption process then occurs on the payload Following this the payload is executedSIDESHOW is a backdoor written in CC that communicates via HTTP POST requests with its C2 server The backdoor is multi-threaded uses RC6 encryption and supports at least 49 commands which can be seen in Table 1 Capabilities include arbitrary command execution WMI capable payload execution via process injection service registry scheduled task and firewall manipulation querying and updating Domain Controller settings creating password protected ZIP files and more SIDESHOW does not explicitly establish persistence however based on the multitude of supported commands it may be commanded to establish persistenceSIDESHOW derives a system-specific RC6 key using the same registry values as TOUCHMOVE and uses the generated key to decrypt the same configuration file from disk that TOUCHMOVE decrypted The decrypted configuration file contains a list of C2 URLs to which SIDESHOW communicates using HTTP POST requests SIDESHOW iterates this C2 URL list and attempts to authenticate to each C2 URL until it is successful Once successful SIDESHOW enters a state of command processing and sends additional HTTP POST requests to retrieve commands SIDESHOW attempts to use the system's default HTTP User-Agent string during C2 communications however if not available it uses the hard-coded HTTP User-Agent stringMozilla50 Windows NT 100 Win64 x64 AppleWebKit53736 KHTML like Gecko Chrome970469299 Safari53736 Edg970107269When communicating to its C2 server via HTTP POST requests SIDESHOW forms a URI parameter string consisting of a mix of randomly selected and hard-coded URI parametersAuthentication requests use the following URI parameter string format1param1hexseedparam2pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2Cparam316randomhexcharsThe first URI parameter value comes from SIDESHOWs configuration and is used to seed the random functionThe second URI parameter value pAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2C is hardcoded and likely an authentication credentialThe third URI parameter value 16randomhexchars is a session identifier sessionid used for future communications and consists of two subcomponents The first URI parameter's value hexseed is used as a random seed value to derive the first eight hexadecimal characters 8randomhexbasedonseed whereas the last eight hexadecimal characters 8randomhexbasedontickcount are derived using the CPU's current tick count as the random seed value This results in the value 8randomhexbasedonseed being deterministic while 8randomhexbasedontickcount is pseudo-randomThe following is an example authentication URI parameter string1pguidA59sslnpAJ9dk4OVq85jxKWoNfw1AG2Ccup2key184B280E341AE63FSIDESHOW

endpoint logs Mandiant identified a unique GUID f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4-9213f6f4d586 in the PolicyID field which is a Unique identifier of the Policy in the data warehouse The Intune Data Warehouse provides insight and information about an enterprise mobile environment such as historical Intune data and Intune data refreshed on a daily occurence The identified GUID also matched the GUID of the PowerShell script file name and the GUID observed in an IME associated registry keyAt the time of analysis the GroupID f391eded-82d3-4506-8bf4-9213f6f4d586 was no longer present in the Intune Endpoint management admin center and was likely deleted by the threat actorsIn order to determine malicious usage of Microsoft Intune Mandiant performed the following analysis stepsMandiant tracks the malware being distributed via InTune as CLOUDBURST CLOUDBURST is a downloader written in C that communicates via HTTP The malware attempts to make itself look like a legitimate version of mscoreedll but contains fake exports the same way that TOUCHSHIFT uses fake exports One variant of CLOUDBURST made use of legitimate open-source software that was added as exports in addition to the fake exports The actual export with malicious code is CorExitProcess The CorExitProcess export expects the single argument -embeddingObjectOnce the aforementioned command line argument has been verified CLOUDBURST

enumerate running processesUpon completion of the host enumeration CLOUDBURST then downloads and executes shellcode from the C2 server At this time Mandiant was unable to recover and identify the purpose of the shellcode downloaded by CLOUDBURSTMandiant has observed UNC2970 leverage weak identity controls in Azure AD combined with Microsoft Intunes endpoint management capabilities to effectively deploy malicious PowerShell scripts onto unsuspecting endpointsIncreasing Azure AD identity protections and limiting access to Microsoft Intune is essential in mitigating the attacker activity observed by Mandiant Organizations should consider implementing the following hardening controlsCloud-Only Accounts Organizations should utilize cloud-only accounts for privileged access within Azure AD eg Global Admins Intune Administrator and never assign privileged access to synced accounts from on-premises identity providers such as Active Directory Additionally admins should utilize a separate daily-driver account for day-to-day activities such as sending email or web-browsing Dedicated admin accounts should be utilized to carry out administrative functions onlyPrivileged Identity Management PIM Solution Mandiant recommends that organizations consider utilizing a PIM solution A PIM solution should include a Just-In-Time JIT access capability which will provide access when requested for a specific duration of time and should initiate an approval flow prior to providing an account access to a highly privileged role eg Global Administrator or Intune AdministratorAzure Identity Protection Azure Identity Protection is a security feature within Azure Active Directory that allows organizations to automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risks Identity Protection analyzes user account activity as-well as sign-in activity to identify potentially compromised accounts or unauthorized authentication requests Identity Protection data can be leveraged to enhance Conditional Access Policies by enforcing access controls based on user or sign-in risk Additionally Identity Protection risk data should be exported to a Security Information and Event Management SIEM solution for further correlation and analysisNote Azure Identity Protection requires an Azure AD Premium P2

        "text": "A Croatian national has been arrested for allegedly operating NetWire a Remote Access Trojan RAT marketed on cybercrime forums since 2012 as a stealthy way to spy on infected systems and siphon passwords The arrest coincided with a seizure of the NetWire sales website by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI While the defendant in this case hasnt yet been named publicly the NetWire website has been leaking information about the likely true identity and location of its owner for the past 11 yearsNetWire has been sold openly on the same website since 2012 worldwiredlabscom That website now features a seizure notice from the US Department of Justice DOJ which says the domain was taken as part of a coordinated law enforcement action taken against the NetWire Remote Access TrojanThe WorldWiredLabs website first came online in February 2012 using a dedicated host with no other domains The sites true WHOIS registration records have always been hidden by privacy protection services but there are plenty of clues in historical Domain Name System DNS records for WorldWiredLabs that point in the same directionIn October 2012 the WorldWiredLabs domain moved to another dedicated server at the Internet address 19891907 which was home to just one other domain printschoolmediaorg also registered in 2012A review of DNS records for both printschoolmediaorg and wwlabshostingcom shows that while these domains were online they both used the DNS name server ns1worldwiredlabscom No other domains have been recorded using that same name serverThe WorldWiredLabs website in 2013 Source ArchiveorgRunning a reverse search on this password in Constella Intelligence shows there are more than 450 email addresses known to have used this credential and two of those are zankomariogmailcom and zankomarioyahoocomA search on zankomariogmailcom in Skype returns three results including the account name Netwire and the username Dugidox and another for a Mario Zanko username zankomarioDugidox corresponds to the hacker handle most frequently associated with NetWire sales and support discussion threads on multiple cybercrime forums over the yearsConstella ties dugidoxgmailcom to a number of website registrations including the Dugidox handle on BlackHatWorld and HackForums and to IP addresses in Croatia for both Constella also shows the email address zankomariogmailcom used the password dugidox2407In 2010 someone using the email address dugidoxgmailcom registered the domain dugidoxcom The WHOIS registration records for that domain list a Senela Eanko as the registrant but the address used was the same street address in Zapresic that appears in the WHOIS records for printschoolmediaorg which is registered in Mr Zancos namePrior to the demise of Google the email address dugidoxgmailcom mapped to an account with the nickname Netwire wwl The dugidox email also was tied to a Facebook account mariozanko3 which featured check-ins and photos from various places in CroatiaThat Facebook profile is no longer active but back in January 2017 the administrator of WorldWiredLabs posted that he was considering adding certain Android mobile functionality to his service Three days after that the MarioZank3 profile posted a photo saying he was selected for an Android instruction course with his dugidox email in the photo naturallyThe UK Companies House records show Godbex was dissolved in 2020 It also says Mr Zanko was born in July 1983 and lists his occupation as electrical engineerUpdate Oct 26 1111 am ET Mario Zanko responded to requests for comment Zanko said while he was indeed detained for three months by Croatian authorities in connection with the Netwire investigation he has not yet been charged with a crime I have not been charged with any crime be it in Croatia the United States the UK or the EU Zanko said The detention was a distressing experience being separated from our family we have 2 minors This entry was posted on Thursday 9th of March 2023 0152 PM I always enjoy that some of these high-tech bandits get undone by careless mistakes and good old fashioned legwork that exposes themIt exposed some random dude who might have no clue about all that Especially if the creators of that trojan chose him as patient zero and used their horse to its full potentialNobody can prove aliens dont exist Its its BKs expose is not enough by itself to convict someone in a court of law but this isnt a court Actual law enforcement agencies in multiple countries that shut down and physically confiscated the servers in a coordinated action to shut down this malware service have the evidence that they need BK wrote about some interesting details that seem to point to the individual behind this Can you debunk any of them in any capacity Any to add Theres a sizeable difference between actually reading carefully and finding such interesting and compounding details versus just having blanket doubts of everything and without any concrete reason or rationale suggesting ALL these various coincidences breadcrumbs photos are all mistakenly pointing at a completely innocent party who just happens to not bother asserting that innocence when asked several times for comment Youd like further confirmation Then wait for it Authorities likely will announce his identity in the coming days though if youd like to believe theyve all made a massive oversight in this investigation spanning years and have the wrong guy youre not bound by the evidence they present either If BK turns out to be mistaken and its a deeper conspiracy framing Zanko as an unwitting patsy BK will no doubt the first to admit and explore any evidence of that in detail as wellno doubt be the firstHes probably lived comfortably for 11 years From what Ive learned over the years major malware purveyors outside of Russia PRC and few other locales are eventually located put out of business andor arrestedno matter how much effort they put into being incognito Especially if has put aside some money for later in life Id say hes don well for himselfethics aside of courseThats a lot of breadcrumbs God I love these breakdowns Thanks

comment is very insightful Theres been little effective effort by government and law enforcement to help protect the vulnerable from cyber threats Some LE organizations are helpful after a successful attack but theres little preventive help available Some of the ISPs and social media companies have started to put in some limited efforts to filter out the most egregious attacks and to make some high-level soft-pedaled warnings to end users but it looks like they want to figure out how to monetize this before doing anything substantialThe current trickle of cyber and telephone scam attacks are not being effectively countered and vulnerable people are being hurt That trickle is going to turn into a flood as more criminals realize that these scams WORK And NOBODY has a planThey both worked in same companiesSuch cases should be dealt with very strictly and closelyAlways love following your work keep it up BrianIve known about the netwire RAT for quite some time puts a smile on my face knowing the creator will see justice What bugs me is so many of these MAAS platforms portray themselves as legitimate yet all keep getting raided Luminosity Orcus imminent monitor and now netwire Whats their deal Anyone with half a brain can see theyre malicious so why are they so obsessed with their imageOnly malicious if sold to the public it seems If your company sells to the police or governments then the same software and services are suddenly legitSo the crime commited was that the software itself was automatically exfiltrating username and passwords as a keylogger Otherwise its just a remote access toolRemote access tools ask users for consent they also make it clear that its running and give users an easy way to close the connection Remote access tools do not quietly install with persistence hide from the user include password recovery or keylogging Thats what Remote access TROJANS do If you think otherwise youre a Exactly And legit remote access tools dont typically recommend or advertise services to make your remote control executable undetectable by antivirus products or bind them with desirablebenign programs or provide supportinstructions on how to evade security tools or bind them with desirablebenign programsTeamViewer wants a word with youto sell you a subscription obviouslyHey Brian what about REMCOS This italian punk basically has been selling a RAT and other malware for yearsDo you even know the difference between malware and pentesting toolslol hella lot of noobs aroundHelloWhere are my credits my name is Arena and I helped with

Arena and I helped with AI type live worm I my AI helped with live tracking over youtube and gmail servicesTo FBI This hacked have couple billion dollars on his bank accountsMaybe I should just create another bus virus and stole his money What you think guysThanks FBINot true Croatian media did release both the name and the picture of Mario Zanko in relation to this Its great to see law enforcement agencies taking action against cybercrime and shutting down websites that sell malware like NetWire The use of remote access trojans poses a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike and its crucial to hold those responsible accountable for their actions Its also essential to take steps to protect your systems from malware by keeping your software up-to-date being cautious of

        "text": "Bitwarden's credentials autofill feature contains a risky behavior that could allow malicious iframes embedded in trusted websites to steal people's credentials and send them to an attackerThe issue was reported by analysts at Flashpoint who said Bitwarden first learned of the problem in 2018 but chose to allow it to accommodate legitimate sites that use iframesAlthough the auto-fill feature is disabled on Bitwarden by default and the conditions to exploit it aren't abundant Flashpoint says there are still websites that meet the requirements where motivated threat actors can attempt to exploit these flawsBitwarden is a popular open-source password management service with a web browser extension that stores secrets like account usernames and passwords in an encrypted vaultWhen its users visit a website the extension detects if there's a stored login for that domain and offers to fill in the credentials If the auto-fill option is enabled it fills them automatically upon the page load without the user having to do anythingWhile analyzing Bitwarden Flashpoint's researchers discovered that the extension also auto-fills forms defined in embedded iframes even those from external domainsWhile the embedded iframe does not have access to any content in the parent page it can wait for input to the login form and forward the entered credentials to a remote server without further user interaction explains FlashpointFlashpoint investigated how often iframes are embedded on login pages of high-traffic websites and reported that the number of risky cases was very low significantly decreasing the riskHowever a second issue discovered by Flashpoint while investigating the iframes problem is that Bitwarden will also auto-fill credentials on subdomains of the base domain matching a loginThis means an attacker hosting a phishing page under a subdomain that matches a stored login for a given base domain will capture the credentials upon the victim visiting the page if autofill is enabledAs an example should a company have a login page at httpsloginscompanytld and allow users to serve content under httpsclientnamecompanytld these users are able to steal credentials from the Bitwarden extensionsRegistering a subdomain that matches the base domain of a legitimate website is not always possible so the severity of the problem is reducedHowever some services allow users to create subdomains to host content such as free hosting services and the attack is still possible through subdomain hijackingHowever since users need to log in to services using embedded iframes from external domains Bitwarden's engineers decided to keep the behavior unchanged and add a warning on the software's documentation and the extension's relevant settings menuResponding to Flashpoint's second report about the URI handling and how auto-fill treats subdomains Bitwarden promised to block autofill on the reported hosting environment in a future update but do not plan on changing the iframe functionalityWhen BleepingComputer contacted Bitwarden about the security risk they confirmed that they have known about this issue since 2018 but have not changed the functionality as login forms on legitimate sites use iframesSo there are perfectly valid use cases where login forms are in an iframe under a different domainUpdate 31723 - Bitwarden has informed BleepingComputer that after careful consideration of the way the password-autofill feature works they have decided to address user concerns by eliminating the iframe attack vector while keeping the autofill functionality intactSpecifically"

        "text": "Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community ESET ResearchESET researchers analyze a cyberespionage campaign that distributes CapraRAT backdoors through trojanized and supposedly secure Android messaging apps but also exfiltrates sensitive information07 Mar 2023 8 min readKey points of the blogpostThis Transparent Tribe campaign mainly targets Indian and Pakistani citizens possibly those with a military or political backgroundIt distributed the Android CapraRAT backdoor via trojanized secure messaging and calling apps branded as MeetsApp and MeetUp the backdoor can exfiltrate any sensitive information from its victims devicesThese trojanized apps were available to download from websites posing as official distribution centers We believe a romance scam was used to lure targets to these websitesPoor operational security around these apps exposed user PII allowing us to geolocate 150 victimsCapraRAT was hosted on a domain that resolved to an IP address previously used by Transparent TribeBesides the inherent working chat functionality of the original legitimate app the trojanized versions include malicious code that we have identified as that of the CapraRAT backdoor Transparent Tribe also known as APT36 is a cyberespionage group known to use CapraRAT we have also seen similar baits deployed against its targets in the past The backdoor is capable of taking screenshots and photos recording phone calls and surrounding audio and exfiltrating any other sensitive information The backdoor can also receive commands to download files make calls and send SMS messages The campaign is narrowly targeted and nothing suggests these apps were ever available on Google PlayBased on the Android Package Kit APK name the first malicious application is branded MeetsApp and claims to provide secure chat communications We were able to find a website from which this sample could have been downloaded meetsapporg see Figure 1Figure 1 Distribution website of CapraRAT posing as MeetsAppAnalysis of the MeetsApp distribution website showed that some of its resources were hosted on another server with a similar domain name meetup-chatcom using a similar service name That site also provided an Android messaging app MeetUp to download with the same package name commeetupapp as for MeetsApp and having the same website logo as can be seen in Figure 2Figure 2 Distribution website of CapraRAT posing as MeetUpBoth apps from the tweet and from the sample downloaded from meetup-chatcom include the same CapraRAT code communicate with the same CC server 66235175914098 and their APK files are signed using the same developer certificateHence we strongly believe that both websites were created by the same threat actor both domains were registered around the same time July 9th and July 25th 2022Both apps are based on the same legitimate code trojanized with CapraRAT backdoor code Messaging functionality seems either to be developed by the threat actor or found maybe purchased online since we couldnt identify its origin Before using the app victims need to create accounts that are linked to their phone numbers and require SMS verification Once this account is created the app requests further permissions that allow the backdoors full functionality to work such as accessing contacts call logs SMS messages external storage and recording audioFigure 3 Malicious class name comparison of older CapraRAT left and more recent version rightDuring our investigation weak operational security resulted in the exposure of some victim data This information allowed us to geolocate over 150 victims in India Pakistan Russia Oman and Egypt as seen in Figure 4Figure 4 Victim distributionBased on our research potential victims were lured to install the app by a honey-trap romance scam operation where most likely they were first contacted on a different platform and then persuaded to use the more secure MeetsApp or MeetUp app We have previously seen such baits being used by Transparent Tribe operators against their targets Finding a mobile number or an email address they can use to make first contact is usually not difficultAs described above the malicious MeetUp app has been available at meetup-chatcom and we believe with high confidence that the malicious MeetsApp was available at meetsapporg Neither app would be automatically installed from these locations the victims had to choose to download and install the apps manually Considering that only a handful individuals were compromised we believe that potential victims were highly targeted and lured using romance schemes with Transparent Tribe operators most likely establishing first contact via another messaging platform After gaining the victims trust they suggested moving to another allegedly more secure chat app that was available on one of the malicious distribution websitesThere was no subterfuge suggesting the app was available in Google PlayAfter the victim signs into the app CapraRAT then starts to interact with its CC server by sending basic device info and waits to receive commands to execute Based on these commands CapraRAT is capable of exfiltratingIt can also receive commands to download a file launch any installed app kill any running app make a call send SMS messages intercept received SMS messages and download an update and request the victim to install itThe mobile campaign operated by Transparent Tribe is still active representing itself as two messaging applications used as a cover to distribute its Android CapraRAT backdoor Both apps are distributed through two similar websites that based on their descriptions provide secure messaging and calling servicesTransparent Tribe probably uses romance scam baits to lure victims into installing the app and continues to communicate with them using the malicious app to keep them on the platform and make their devices accessible to the attacker CapraRAT is remotely controlled and based on the commands from the CC server it can exfiltrate any sensitive information from its victims devicesOperators of these apps had poor operational security resulting in victim PII being exposed to our researchers across the open internet Because of that it was possible to obtain some information about the victimsSHA-1Package nameESET detection nameDescription4C6741660AFED4A0E68EF622AA1598D903C10A01commeetupchatAndroidSpyCapraRATACapraRAT

specifically distributing the UUE file types with different themes includeThis is consistent with the use of the Spanish language in the groups spear-phishing emails Most countries in South America use Spanish apart from Brazil which matches the threat actors locale and the names in the bait documentAPT-C-36 is a South American-based threat actor active since at least 2019 The group continues to concentrate its operations within a Hispanic geographic region with its main targets being government institutions and other organizations primarily based in ColombiaThe use of specific tools and artifacts along with the type and configuration of the network infrastructure documented in this report combined with the tactics techniques procedures TTPs used to deploy them all closely align with previously attributed campaigns by this groupThat coupled with the geolocation and nature of the targets seen in this campaign leads us to ascertain at the very least a moderate level of confidence that this campaign was conducted by APT-C-36This campaign continues to operate for the purposes of information theft and espionage The modus operandi used has mostly stayed the same as the groups previous efforts it is very simple which may mean that this group is comfortable with its way of launching campaigns via phishing emails and feels confident in using them because they continue to

        "title": "Hackers Claim They Breached T-Mobile More Than 100 Times in 2022 Krebs on Security",
        "text": "Image ShutterstockcomThree different cybercriminal groups claimed access to internal networks at communications giant T-Mobile in more than 100 separate incidents throughout 2022 new data suggests In each case the goal of the attackers was the same Phish T-Mobile employees for access to internal company tools and then convert that access into a cybercrime service that could be hired to divert any T-Mobile users text messages and phone calls to another deviceThe conclusions above are based on an extensive analysis of Telegram chat logs from three distinct cybercrime groups or actors that have been identified by security researchers as particularly active in and effective at SIM-swapping which involves temporarily seizing control over a targets mobile phone numberCountless websites and online services use SMS text messages for both password resets and multi-factor authentication This means that stealing someones phone number often can let cybercriminals hijack the targets entire digital life in short order including access to any financial email and social media accounts tied to that phone numberAll three SIM-swapping entities that were tracked for this story remain active in 2023 and they all conduct business in open channels on the instant messaging platform Telegram KrebsOnSecurity is not naming those channels or groups here because they will simply migrate to more private servers if exposed publicly and for now those servers remain a useful source of intelligence about their activitiesEach advertises their claimed access to T-Mobile systems in a similar way At a minimum every SIM-swapping opportunity is announced with a brief Tmobile up or Tmo up message to channel participants Other information in the announcements includes the price for a single SIM-swap request and the handle of the person who takes the payment and information about the targeted subscriberInitially the goal of this project was to count how many times each entity claimed access to T-Mobile throughout 2022 by cataloging the various Tmo up posts from each day and working backwards from Dec 31 2022But by the time we got to claims made in the middle of May 2022 completing the rest of the years timeline seemed unnecessary The tally shows that in the last seven-and-a-half months of 2022 these groups collectively made SIM-swapping claims against T-Mobile on 104 separate days often with multiple groups claiming access on the same daysThe 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee toolsKrebsOnSecurity shared a large amount of data gathered for this story with T-Mobile The company declined to confirm or deny any of these claimed intrusions But in a written statement T-Mobile said this type of activity affects the entire wireless industryAnd we are constantly working to fight against it the statement reads We have continued to drive enhancements that further protect against unauthorized access including enhancing multi-factor authentication controls hardening environments limiting access to data apps or services and more We are also focused on gathering threat intelligence data like what you have shared to help further strengthen these ongoing effortsWhile it is true that each of these cybercriminal actors periodically offer SIM-swapping services for other mobile phone providers including ATT Verizon and smaller carriers those solicitations appear far less frequently in these group chats than T-Mobile swap offers And when those offers do materialize they are considerably more expensiveThe prices advertised for a SIM-swap against T-Mobile customers in the latter half of 2022 ranged between USD 1000 and 1500 while SIM-swaps offered against ATT and Verizon customers often cost well more than twice that amountTo be clear KrebsOnSecurity is not aware of specific SIM-swapping incidents tied to any of these breach claims However the vast majority of advertisements for SIM-swapping claims against T-Mobile tracked in this story had two things in common that set them apart from random SIM-swapping ads on TelegramFirst they included an offer to use a mutually trusted middleman or escrow provider for the transaction to protect either party from getting scammed More importantly the cybercriminal handles that were posting ads for SIM-swapping opportunities from these groups generally did so on a daily or near-daily basis often teasing their upcoming swap events in the hours before posting a Tmo up message announcementIn other words if the crooks offering these SIM-swapping services were ripping off their customers or claiming to have access that they didnt this would be almost immediately obvious from the responses of the more seasoned and serious cybercriminals in the same chat channelOne of the groups that reliably posted Tmo up messages to announce SIM-swap availability against T-Mobile customers also reliably posted Tmo down follow-up messages announcing exactly when their claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools was discovered and revoked by the mobile giantA review of the timestamps associated with this groups incessant Tmo up and Tmo down posts indicates that while their claimed access to employee tools usually lasted less than an hour in some cases that access apparently went undiscovered for several hours or even daysHow could these SIM-swapping groups be gaining access to T-Mobiles network as frequently as they claim Peppered throughout the daily chit-chat on their Telegram channels are solicitations for people urgently needed to serve as callers or those who can be hired to social engineer employees over the phone into navigating to a phishing website and entering their employee credentialsNixon argues that many people in the security community tend to discount the threat from voice phishing attacks as somehow low tech and low probability threatsI see it as not low-tech at all because there are a lot of moving parts to phishing these days Nixon said You have the caller who has the employee on the line and the person operating the phish kit who needs to spin it up and down fast enough so that it doesnt get flagged by security companies Then they have to get the employee on that phishing site and steal their credentialsIn addition she said often there will be yet another co-conspirator whose job it is to use the stolen credentials and log into employee tools That person may also need to figure out how to make their device pass posture checks a form of device authentication that some companies use to verify that each login is coming only from employer-issued phones or laptopsFor aspiring criminals with little experience in scam calling there are plenty of sample call transcripts available on these Telegram chat channels that walk one through how to impersonate an IT technician at the targeted company and how to respond to pushback or skepticism from the employee Heres a snippet from one such tutorial that appeared recently in one of the SIM-swapping channelsHello this is James calling from Metro IT department hows your day todayyea im doing good how r uim doing great thank you for askingim calling in regards to a ticket we got last week from you guys saying you guys were having issues with the network connectivity which also interfered with Microsoft Edge not letting you sign in or disconnecting you randomly We havent received any updates to this ticket ever since it was created so thats why Im calling in just to see if theres still an issue or notThe TMO UP data referenced above combined with comments from the SIM-swappers themselves indicate that while many of their claimed accesses to T-Mobile tools in the middle of 2022 lasted hours on end both the frequency and duration of these events began to steadily decrease as the year wore onT-Mobile declined to discuss what it may have done to combat these apparent intrusions last year However one of the groups began to complain loudly in late October 2022 that T-Mobile must have been doing something that was causing their phished access to employee tools to die very soon after they obtained itOne group even remarked that they suspected T-Mobiles security team had begun monitoring their chatsIndeed the timestamps associated with one groups TMO UPTMO DOWN notices show that their claimed access was often limited to less than 15 minutes throughout November and December of 2022Whatever the reason the calendar graphic above clearly shows that the frequency of claimed access to T-Mobile decreased significantly across all three SIM-swapping groups in the waning weeks of 2022T-Mobile US reported revenues of nearly 80 billion last year It currently employs more than 71000 people in the United States any one of whom can be a target for these phishersA U2F device made by YubikeyThese breaches should not happen Weaver said Because T-Mobile should have long ago issued all employees security keys and switched to security keys for the second factor And because security keys provably block this style of attackThe most commonly used security keys are inexpensive USB-based devices A security key implements a form of multi-factor authentication known as Universal 2nd Factor U2F which allows the user to complete the login process simply by inserting the USB key and pressing a button on the device The key works without the need for any special software driversThe allure of U2F devices for multi-factor authentication is that even if an employee who has enrolled a security key for authentication tries to log in at an impostor site the companys systems simply refuse to request the security key if the user isnt on their employers legitimate website and the login attempt fails Thus the second factor cannot be phished either over the phone or InternetNixon said one confounding aspect of SIM-swapping is that these criminal groups tend to recruit teenagers to do their dirty workA huge reason this problem has been allowed to spiral out of control is because children play such a prominent role in this form of breach Nixon saidNixon said SIM-swapping groups often advertise low-level jobs on places like Roblox and Minecraft online games that are extremely popular with young adolescent malesStatistically speaking that kind of recruiting is going to produce a lot of people who are underage she said They recruit children because theyre naive you can get more out of them and they have legal protections that other people over 18 dont haveFor example she said even when underage SIM-swappers are arrested the offenders tend to go right back to committing the same crimes as soon as theyre releasedIn the shadow of such mega-breaches any damage from the continuous attacks by these SIM-swapping groups can seem insignificant by comparison But Nixon says its a mistake to dismiss SIM-swapping as a low volume problemLogistically you may only be able to get a few dozen or a hundred SIM-swaps in a day but you can pick any customer you want across their entire customer base she said Just because a targeted account takeover is low volume doesnt mean its low risk These guys have crews that go and identify people who are high net worth individuals and who have a lot to loseNixon said another aspect of SIM-swapping that causes cybersecurity defenders to dismiss the threat from these groups is the perception that they are full of low-skilled script kiddies a derisive term used to describe novice hackers who rely mainly on point-and-click hacking toolsThey underestimate these actors and say this person isnt technically sophisticated she said But if youre rolling around in millions worth of stolen crypto currency you can buy that sophistication I know for a fact some of these compromises were at the hands of these script kiddies but theyre not ripping off other peoples scripts so much as hiring people to make scripts for them And they dont care what gets the job done as long as they get to steal the money This entry was posted on Tuesday 28th of February 2023 1114 AM Ive been a T-Mobile customer for years It took me about 10 minutes way back when to figure out they were under the magic spell of social engineers Germans who know about Max Planck know he played a dangerous game and paid dearly nothing new there I was eventually forced into a Smart Phone by the demise of 3G but get weekly nags to fully install my OS Thats not what Max Planck would doSounds more like your phone needs security updates which otherwise leaves your device vulnerable to various malware hacksA new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it Max PlanckBrian didnt you say once that there is somewhere we can register to essentially freeze our SIM card so to speak like you put a freeze on your credit reports with the big 3 4 credit bureaus I vaguely remember the report and you saying that putting a freeze on your credit reports doesnt likewise protect the SIM cardmobile number so you had to put a separate freeze with a different company What is that company and do all mobile carriers honor that freezeOr am I totally misremembering that article and theres no comparable freeze mechanism to prevent SIM swapsIts called a NOPORT You must call T-Mobile and ask them to enable NO PORT on your number If the agent doesnt know what youre talking about end the call and call again to get an agent that doesVerizon calls it Number Lock you can enable it in the phone app and I believe on the website You dont need to talk to a person to turn it onNo need to call in you can do this from t-mobile account settings privacy sim lockCan you please give more detail on how to do this I cant find it in the settingsSelect Account then Privacy Notifications then SIM Protection then enable itJust checked my T-Mo accounts discovered that the SIM protection feature had somehow been turned OFF who knows when but definitely by T-Mo I know that I turned it on as soon as that option was available to customers so beware double check if you have previously used this security featureVery important not to confuse with another setting in the general phone settings called SIM card lock This particular setting does NOT prevent a SIM swapBrian employee-issued phones or laptopsThat should be employer-issuedYou can and probably should take advantage of whatever protections are offered by the phone companies But its important to point out that if an employee can put these restrictions in place a phished or collusive employee can undo that in a secondYou forgot to mention another vector for SIM swapping rouge cell service employees trying to make a quick buck by trying to take advantage of the company they work for Another real good read Thank you for the NOPORT term good to know the specific ask Hope this would prevent t-mobile insiders from sim-swapping but given t-mobiles security stance I have no such hope and left t-mobile in disgust some time ago since they really dont care about breaches or such 80 BILLION revenue allows for many settlements and still walk away fat Brian has done a great job illustrating the ramification of sim swaps ouchT-Mobile account login has a serious flaw when it comes to MFA You can set up your account to use TOTP But you are still presented with the option to use SMS for 2FA at every login There is no way to disable the SMS optionThis is a shortcoming of a lot of 2FA systems Seemingly they provide little protection because you cant limit it to just one system and eventually it will even lead into security questions to allow a log inNot everywhereAzure AD does not have fallbackFallbacks has to be designed into the solutionUnfortunately I just discovered this I thought I was helping to secure my T-Mobile account by implementing Google Authenticator Then I discover that theres no way to disable the SMS option What the heck Isnt there a single Cyber Security engineer at T-Mobile who says Wait this is moronicThis is exactly what you get with dumbo CISOs with MBA and other unrelated disciplinesLike going to have a surgery with an attorneyMost US companies are like this Its not going to change because there is no skilled labor with needed skills in Cybersecurity in the UShonestly at this point they should just change their name to t-morrowwellgethackedagainU2F can provide a fairly high level of security to the authentication process But proper implementation is critical Implementation of some backup factor is a very good idea but frequently leads to the weak link As vaadu noted in their comment above T-mobile has implemented SMS as a backup to TOTP and has introduced a weaker link though SMS That essentially makes TOTP of no use since the weaker SMS is always available They could do the same to a U2F implementationI have a primary and backup U2F keys which are both USB and NFC interfaced There are precious few location where I can use U2F though I use gmail google voice and have a family domain with google workspace where I use them ATT wireless uses SMS so no go there Outlookcom and Yahoocom and a handful of others Curiously few financial institutions have implemented U2F even worse most use SMS for 2FADoes TMO not use MFA and phishing just needs a username and password to get into their internal systems Or how was MFA phished tooto social engineer employees over the phone into navigating to a phishing website and entering their employee credentialsIts time to complain to your bank about not supporting FIDO2 or at least TOTPIs there a list of banks that do Complain with your feetwalletOr complain to your bank that could work In some definition of workOh yes sir I agree sir well get right on that sir Is there anything elseHave you seen our new rewards gimmick account Oh you haveBrianHow does the new ESIM equate into this Is it more likely to be breached or less likelyDepends All you need is QR code Often no need to leave your house no need to call anywhere in Europe all you need is the victims account They store passwords in plaintext Its bad badI just now called Tmo 611 tech Patricia and found you need both NOPORT and SimProtect NOPORT keeps anyone from porting your number to a carrier outside of TMo but you also need SimProtect which keeps anyone from changing your Sim card serial number to a different Sim card serial to be used on a new phone remotely which is how simswap scammers work SimProtect at TMo requires in-person visit and ID presentation at TMo to get your phone number assigned to a new Sim card serial number provided thereplease delete my last name from my previous post I just madeThanks for that my dear friendsI just now called Tmo 611 tech Patricia and found you need both NOPORT and SimProtect NOPORT keeps anyone from porting your number to a carrier outside of TMo but you also need SimProtect which keeps anyone from changing your Sim card serial number to a different Sim card serial to be used on a new phone remotely which is how simswap scammers workCan somebody tell me if in europe sim swapping is going on also or is this a specific US problemSo T-Mobile is dropping auto-pay by credit card as of May 2023 To continue receiving the auto-pay discount on billing you have to replace the credit card with a debit card or a bank accountHow safe are these options in the next T-Mobile security breachThank you for the NOPORT term good to know the specific ask Hope this would prevent t-mobile insiders from sim-swapping but given t-mobiles security stance I have no such hope and left t-mobile in disgust some time ago
