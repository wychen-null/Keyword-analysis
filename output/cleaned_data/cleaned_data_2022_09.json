        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather Zinc is now tracked as Diamond SleetBeginning in June 2022 ZINC employed traditional social engineering tactics by initially connecting with individuals on LinkedIn to establish a level of trust with their targets Upon successful connection ZINC encouraged continued communication over WhatsApp which acted as the means of delivery for their malicious payloadsMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint provides comprehensive protection against tools and custom malware used by ZINC including ZetaNile The hunting queries provided at the end of this blog will help customers comprehensively search their environments for relevant indicators As with any observed nation-state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised providing them with the information they need to secure their accountsZINC is a highly operational destructive and sophisticated nation-state activity group Active since 2009 the activity group gained further public notoriety in 2014 following their successful attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment ZINC is known to use a variety of custom remote access tools RATs as part of their arsenal including those detected by Microsoft as FoggyBrass and PhantomStarZINC attacks appear to be motivated by traditional cyberespionage theft of personal and corporate data financial gain and corporate network destruction ZINC attacks bear many hallmarks of state-sponsored activities such as heightened operational security sophisticated malware that evolves over time and politically motivated targetingZINC tracked by other security companies as Labyrinth Chollima and Black Artemis has been observed conducting this campaign from late April to mid-September 2022LinkedIn Threat Prevention and Defense detected ZINC creating fake profiles claiming to be recruiters working at technology defense and media entertainment companies with the goal of moving targets away from LinkedIn and to the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp for the delivery of malware ZINC primarily targeted engineers and technical support professionals working at media and information technology companies located in the UK India and the US Targets received outreach tailored to their profession or background and were encouraged to apply for an open position at one of several legitimate companies In accordance with their policies for accounts identified in these attacks LinkedIn quickly terminated any accounts associated with inauthentic or fraudulent behaviorOnce they have established a connection with their target ZINC operationalized malicious versions of two SSH clients PuTTY and KiTTY that acted as the entry vector for the ZetaNile implant Both utilities provide terminal emulator support for different networking protocols making them attractive programs for individuals commonly targeted by ZINC The weaponized versions were often delivered as compressed ZIP archives or ISO files Within that archive the recipient is provided a ReadMetxt and an executable file to run As part of the evolution of ZINCs malware development and in an effort to evade traditional defenses running the included executable does not drop the ZetaNile implant For ZetaNile to be deployed the SSH utility requires the IP provided in the ReadMetxt file An example of the content of that file is provided belowZINC has been using trojanized PuTTY as part of its attack chain for many years and this most recent variant establishes persistence on compromised devices by utilizing scheduled tasks This activity was recently reported by Mandiant The malicious PUTTYexe is configured to install the Event Horizon malware in CProgramDatacoloruidll and subsequently copy CWindowsSystem32colorcplexe to CProgramDatacolorcplexe By using DLL search order hijacking ZINC can load the second stage malware coluruidll and decode the payload with the key 0CE1241A44557AA438F27BC6D4ACA246 to be used for command and control Upon successful connection to the C2 server the attackers can install additional malware on the compromised device for other tasksLastly persistence is established with the creation of a daily scheduled task PackageColor as part of the configuration for the weaponized PuTTY ZINC accomplishes this with the following commandWhile ZINC has utilized weaponized PuTTY for many years ZINC has only recently expanded their capabilities to include weaponizing a fork of PuTTY called KiTTY The executable first collects the username and hostname of the victim system It then sends that information to a hardcoded IP 17293201253 over TCP22 which does not use SSH protocol and does not require SSH handshake to establish communication Upon successful TCP connection to the server at 13718415189 the malicious KiTTY executable then deploys the malware as AppDatamscoreedll following multiple rounds of decoding The mscoreedll file is the embedded payload detected as EventHorizon in the ZetaNile malware family Similar to ZINCs version of PuTTY the actor uses DLL search order hijacking to load malicious DLL files that perform tasks within the context of these legitimate Windows processes specifically through AppDataKiTTYPresentationHostexe -EmbeddingObjectThe mscoreedll malware is modularized in such a way that upon successful connection to the compromised C2 domain the attackers can install additional malware on the target system as needed using the existing C2 communication such as executing CProgramDataCiscofixmapiexe -s AudioEndpointBuilder to load malicious mapistubdll from the compromised C2 server The HTTP POST requests contain the hardcoded user agent string with misspelled Edge as detailed below and contain a unique ID for the field gametype and the hardcoded value for the field type for malware campaign tracking purposesBeginning in September 2022 ZINC was observed utilizing a trojanized TightVNC Viewer that was delivered to a target alongside a weaponized SSH utility over WhatsApp This malware has a unique PDBPathThe weaponized versions of TightVNC Viewer often were delivered as compressed ZIP archives or job description-themed ISO files via online platforms such as WhatsApp Within that archive the recipient is provided a ReadMetxt and an executable file to run The txt file has the following contentAs part of the threat actors latest malware technique to evade traditional defenses the malicious TightVNC Viewer has a pre-populated list of remote hosts and its configured to install the backdoor only when the user selects ec2-aet-techw-adaamazonaws from the drop-down menu in the TightVNC Viewer as shown in Figure 5The malware was configured to send the username and hostname to IP 442387484 on TCP22 as part of the victim check-in with the C2 and establish VNC connections to the same IP on port TCP5900 Once a successful connection is established to the server IP the embedded second stage DLL payload from TightVNCexe is loaded in memory to establish C2 communication to a known compromised domainZINC has operationalized malicious versions of two PDF readers Sumatra PDF and muPDFSubliminal Recording installer that act as the entry vector for the ZetaNile implant This delivery mechanism is often utilized in relation to fraudulent job postings delivered to job-seeking targets in the IT and defense sector The weaponized versions were often delivered as compressed ZIP archives Within that archive the recipient is provided with an executable file to run While the malicious Sumatra PDF reader is a fully functional PDF reader that can load the malicious implant from a fake PDF the muPDFSubliminal Recording installer can set up the backdoor without loading any malicious PDF filesThe trojanized version of Sumatra PDF Reader named SecurePDFexe has been utilized by ZINC since at least 2019 and remains a unique ZINC tradecraft SecurePDFexe is a modularized loader that can install the ZetaNile implant by loading a weaponized job application themed file with a PDF extension The fake PDF contains a header SPV005 a decryption key encrypted second stage implant payload and encrypted decoy PDF which is rendered in the Sumatra PDF Reader when the file is openedOnce loaded in memory the second stage malware is configured to send the victims system hostname and device information using custom encoding algorithms to a C2 communication server as part of the C2 check-in process The attackers can install additional malware onto the compromised devices using the C2 communication as neededWithin the trojanized version of muPDFSubliminal Recording installer setupexe is configured to check if the file path ISSetupPrerequisitesSetup64exe exists and write Ccolrctlcoloruidll on disk after extracting the embedded executable inside setupexe It then copies CWindowsSystem32ColorCplexe to CColorCtrlColorCplexe For the second stage malware the malicious installer creates a new process Ccolorctrlcolorcplexe C3A9B30B6A313F289297C9A36730DB6D and the argument C3A9B30B6A313F289297C9A36730DB6D gets passed on to coloruidll as a decryption key The DLL coloruidll which Microsoft is tracking as the EventHorizon malware family is injected into CWindowsSystemcredwizexe or iexpressexe to send C2 HTTP requests as part of the victim check-in process and to get an additional payloadMicrosoft will continue to monitor ZINC activity and implement protections for our customers The current detections and IOCs in

device is Roaming and the romingSetted config value is disabled 0 the application cant accept commands via HTTP SMS and MQTTThe commands received via SMS will be described in the following paragraphs numbers in range 0-8Command 0The first command is KILL and can be used to perform self deletion on the phoneThe process sets the intent action to KILL retrieves a PendingIntent that will perform a broadcast and schedules an alarm as displayed belowThe application creates a HandlerThread that will perform the necessary operationsCommand 1This command is used to send a Ping message via SMS or HTTP Depending on the value received in the parameters 0 or 1 the spyware chooses between the two communication channelsThe Ack ID received in the command and a counter value will be part of the SMS message that is sentThe process logs the phone number to send messages to the Ack ID and the counter It computes the time after the last network communication with C2 in secondsIn the case of HTTP communication the agent creates a Handler object and calls the postDelayed function with a delay of 5 secondsThe malware creates an XmlSerializer object that will be encrypted using the AES algorithm and then sent to a C2 server via HTTP Finally it checks if the data was successfully sentCommand 2In this case the process tries to compute the index of in the arguments The resulting two values will be used to modify the adrate and adlocation configuration options For example if the adrate value is set to 0 then the malware stops the location monitoring functionality However if the adlocation value is 0 or adrate adlocation then the malware starts the functionalityWhen stopping the location monitoring functionality the process sets the intent action to finishLocationMonitor and calls the cancel methodThe getSystemService function is utilized to retrieve a handle to the location service The agent receives data about the location from the network and passive providers see figure

attack was carried out starting in late summer 2022 targeting at least two high-profile military contractor companiesThe overall attack chain can be seen in the figure 1 below which highlights the initial compromise phase of the attack which as you can see is quite robust compared to most loaders weve seen in the pastFigure 1 Attack ChainFigure 2 Company BenefitspdflnkThe shortcut file does some tricky things to avoid detection First it attempts to hide its execution by calling forfiles rather than cmdexe or powershellexe like weve seen in the pastIt then takes the powershellexe executable file and then copies it to CWindows renames it to AdobeAcrobatPDFReader and then uses it to execute the rest of the PowerShell string Logs generated from Sysinternals Sysmon identify this in figure 3 belowFigure 3 Windows logs showing renamed PowerShellexeThe rest of the powershell script runs on a loop with a 120 second timeout or until an error is not produced C2 communication is attempted at the URL hxxpstermadev0 to pull down the initial stagerOnce the lnk file is executed by the user a rather large and robust chain of stagers will execute Each stager is written in PowerShell and each is very heavily obfuscated In total we observed eight layers to the stage which carry a wide range of techniquesLets start peeling back this onion of stagers by first examining the first stage as it is executed from the remote C2 server The file which is loaded remotely via invoke expression is an extensionless file simply named 0Each encoded or obfuscated layer will be highlighted in the table below along with code snippets for a better visualFigure 4Figure 5Figure 6Figure 7Figure 8Figure 9Just before the last stage was downloaded and executed stage 7 provided some interesting techniques involving obfuscation counter forensics and anti-debuggingFigure 10 AMSI EvasionCounter-forensics or anti-debugging techniques were quite prevalent and nearly hostile The code first checks for processes matching a long list of those which could be used for monitoring process execution flow or disassemblyThis list includesfiddler procmon sysmon idaproida64 ida64pro dnSpy

uses WMI again to check for the system install date and memory information If the date is less than three days the script will failNative PowerShell commands are used for two more checks one looking for Win32PhysicalMemory property for memory matching QEMUVirtualBoxVirtualPCVMwareHypervisor Get-ComputerInfo is then used for computer properties containing CsDomainHyperVisorPresent -like WORKGROUPTrue This checks for the presence of a hypervisor or a non-domain joined systemFigure 11 Counter-forensics Anti-analysisMost malware when it fails a sandbox or anti-analysis check will typically halt execution and quit This hostility in this script was interesting When the check fails rather than quitting it will disable the systems network adapters use netsh to configure the Windows Firewall to block all inbound and outbound traffic and then uses an obfuscated PowerShell command gal r0m in place of the Remove-Item commandlet to delete everything in the users profile directory G F and E drives recursively Then the computer will shut down via the commandlet Stop-ComputerThe next bit of code is interesting If the systems language is set to zh Chinese or to ru Russian then the code will simply exit and the computer will shut downFigure 12 Language DetectionAnother trivial check it performs is looking for the amount of physical memory and if it is less than 4gb itll shut down the machine its running on quietly If all checks pass the malicious script will then begin disabling detection engines beginning with PowerShell Script Block LoggingFigure 13 Disable Script Block LoggingNext in an effort to further along the script block logging bypass the signatures variable with a new empty hashset Pairing this with the force parameter will cause the statement to never be true which again bypasses loggingEvent tracing for PowerShell and Application logging is then disabled using the Remove-EtwTraceProvider commandletIn the figure 14 below the last command sets 0 to the fields SystemManagementAutomationTracingPSEtwLogProvider and etwProvidermenabled which effectively disables the PowerShell Suspicious ScriptBlock Logging functionalityFigure 14 Script Block Logging Bypass contLastly module logging and the standard Microsoft PowerShell logs are disabled via LogPipelineExecutionDetails property and via registry editsThe next block of code checks for admin privileges using an SID match for S-1-5-32-544 If the match is true it will add exclusions using the PowerShell commandlet for the processes forfilesexe powershellexe and cmdexe It will then add exclusions for any file ending with the extensions lnk rar and exe Exclusions are also set for the following pathsLastly archive scanning is disabled The next line of code on line 68 of figure 15 below is a heavily obfuscated command which calls MpCmdRunexe with the flags -RemoveDefinitaions -AllFigure 15 Bypass DefenderThe script attempts several persistence methods The first is embedding itself into the registry The key Default is created with a value containing a malicious PowerShell scriptThe PowerShell script attempts to download and invoke termavipw4u After analyzing the file u it appears to be the same script that we are currently analyzing the 7th deobfuscated stage of the original scriptSeveral other keys are modified which can be used for IOC detections and will be included in the IoC section at the end of the articleFigure 16 Persistence RegistryThe script also attempts to embed itself as a scheduled task on the affected host The task names itself one of two names depending on the permission levelThe task is created using some clever obfuscation to hide the call to schtasksexe It uses an invoke expression mixed with wildcard matching so envtr2hk translates to envSYSTEMROOTSystem32schtasksexeThe task is designed to run the exact same script that we noticed in the registry persistence section however the invoked script is named w instead of u and it was hosted on a different C2 URL however the code was identical and produced matching file hashesFigure 17 Persistence Scheduled TasksA startup shortcut is created into the users APPDATAMicrosoftWindowsStartMenuProgramsStartup directory with the name MicrosoftWSlnk Similar to the shortcut used with the initial infection phase of the attack the shortcut is modified to execute forfilesexe taking PowerShellexe and masquerading it as MicrosoftStartupTask to execute the rest of the PowerShell stringThe Lolbin wsresetexe when executed by itself takes whatever data is stored in the value HKCUSoftwareClassesAppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2Shellopencommand and executes it This key was modified earlier during the registry persistence phase of the execution flowFigure 18 Persistence Startup ShortcutFigure 18 Persistence WMI SubscriptionThe final block of code downloads decrypts and executes a remote payload named headerpng from the URL termaappsstaticimgheaderpng While we were able to download and analyze the headerpng file we were not able to decode it as we believe the campaign was completed and our theory is that the file was replaced in order to prevent further analysis Our attempts to decode the payload would only produce garbage dataThe payload was encrypted using AES encryption and decrypted and executed via an obfuscated invoke expression located on the last line of the codeFigure 19 Decode and ExecuteThe threat actors maintained a robust C2 network which consisted of several observed domains We observed the following domains used in various portions of the attack chainThe domains above first appeared in July 2022 and were pointed to DigitalOcean servers under the IP address 2819953243 and 16522713939 They were later pointed to CloudFlare servers to provide CDN and security services which would also mask their original IP addresses and provide other functions such as HTTPSTLS encryption as well as geoblockingFrom the original IP addresses we were able to gather additional domain-related information We discovered that the related website cobham-satcomonrendercom was also usedOverall it is clear that this attack was relatively sophisticated with the malicious threat actor paying specific attention to opsec There were a lot of relatively recent attack techniques at play some of which were unfamiliar and required additional analysis such as leveraging the PowerShell Get-Alias commandlet to perform an invoke expressionPersistence was a step above what we typically see as well Leveraging the registry WMI subscriptions scheduled tasks and incorporating Lolbins with the process was overall clever and needs to be monitored for While this was a very targeted attack the tactics and techniques used are well known and it

technical description will be provided in subsequent reportsSmokeLoader aka Smoke is a modular malware that has been known since 2011 distributed via phishing emails and drive-by downloads It has evolved its capabilities with additional modules over the years For example disabling of Windows Defender and anti-analysis techniques have been added to the malware However most threat actors only use the main functionality payload downloading and executingIn contrast to the simplest downloaders that download malicious files using hardcoded static URLs SmokeLoader communicates with the CC in order to receive and perform download tasksRedLine Stealer has been known since early 2020 and developed through 2021 The malware is known to be sold on online forums and distributed via phishing emailsA newer method of spreading RedLine Stealer is by luring Windows 10 users to get fake Windows 11 upgrades When the user downloads and executes the binary theyre actually running the malwareRedLines main purpose is to steal credentials and information from browsers in addition to stealing credit card details and cryptocurrency wallets from the compromised machine Moreover the malware also collects information about the system such as username hardware details and installed security applicationsThe malware is known to be distributed via other botnets such as Glupteba The main aim of the PseudoManuscrypt threat actors is to spy on their victims by stealing cookies from Firefox Google Chrome Microsoft Edge Opera and Yandex Browser keylogging and stealing cryptocurrency by utilizing the ClipBanker plugin A distinctive feature of the malware is the use of the KCP protocol to download additional pluginsColdStealer is a relatively new malicious program that was discovered in 2022 Like many other stealers its main purpose is to steal credentials and information from web browsers in addition to stealing cryptocurrency wallets FTP credentials various files and information about the system such as OS version system language processor type and clipboard data The only known method of delivering stolen information to cybercriminals is by sending a ZIP archive to an embedded control centerColdStealer Main functionFormatLoader is a downloader that got its name for using hardcoded URLs as format strings where it needs to fill a single digit to get a link to download an additional binary The available digit range is also hardcodedFormatLoaders main purpose is to infect the machine with an additional malicious file by downloading the binary to the compromised machine To do so the malware adds digits from the hardcoded range one by one to the hardcoded format strings and accesses the download linksIn addition FormatLoader uses a third-party website service for tracking the compromised machine It sends a GET request to a specific URL of an IP logger service which collects information such as IP address and IP-based geolocationCsdiMonetize is known to be an advertising platform that used to install many different PUAs Potentially Unwanted Applications on a Pay-Per-Install basis after infecting the users machine Later on rather than just infecting their victim with PUAs CsdiMoneitze began infecting their victims with actual Trojans like the Glupteba malwareNowadays CsdiMonetize infects its victims with additional malware family types such as Fabookie Disbuk PseudoManuscrypt and moreCsdi execution chainThe infection begins with NSIS installer 61f665303c295Sun1059d492746cexe which downloads the Csdi installer MSEkniexe The Csdi installer requests the current configuration from the CC and a list of additional Csdi components to install Configuration is stored in several registry keys in encrypted and base64 encoded form The next step is to download additional components the most notable being publisher and updater components The Csdi publisher component is responsible for showing advertisements by launching the browser with URLs as command line parameters The updater component is responsible for a Pay-Per-Install service It receives the list of URLs from the CC and instructions on how to drop and execute downloaded filesDisbuk aka Socelar is known to disguise itself as a legitimate application such as PDF editor softwareThis malware was found to mainly target Facebook Ads and evolved to steal Facebook session cookies from Chrome and Firefox by accessing the browsers SQLite database After retrieving this information the malware attempts to extract additional information like access tokens account IDs etc After further evolution Disbuk has also started retrieving Amazon cookiesBesides stealing data Disbuk also installs a malicious browser extension that masquerades as a Google Translate extension To get more information about a users Facebook account Disbuk queries Facebook Graph APIFabookie is another stealer that targets Facebook Ads Its functionality is similar to the Disbuk malware and includes stealing Facebook session cookies from browsers using Facebook Graph API Queries to receive additional information about a users account linked payment method balance friends etc Stolen credentials can later be used to run ads from the compromised accountUnlike Disbuk this malware does not contain built-in malicious browser extensions but contains two embedded NirSoft utilities Chrome Cookies View and Web Browser Password Viewer that are used to extract data from browsersDanaBot is a Trojan-Banker written in Delphi that spreads via email phishing and is known to have evolved since it was discovered in 2018DanaBot is a modular malware that includes various additional modules the most popular functionalities of these modules are stealing information from compromised machines and injecting fake forms into popular ecommerce and social media sites to collect payment data It can also provide full access to infected systems with remote desktop or mouse and keyboard access by utilizing a VNC pluginRacealer aka RaccoonStealer is known to be a stealer-type malware that mostly extracts user credentials and exfiltrates data from compromised machinesRacoon is also known to have evolved over the years since it was discovered in 2019 For example it now uses Telegram to retrieve CC IP addresses and malware configurations Moreover additional modules are now being downloaded from the malwares CCs that are also used to extract credentialsGenericClipBanker is a clipboard hijacker malware that monitors the clipboard of the compromised machine and specifically searches for cryptocurrency addresses in order to replace them When a user copies an address of a cryptocurrency wallet the malware replaces the address of the wallet with their own cryptocurrency

SgnitLoader is a small Trojan-Downloader written in C The downloader binary size is about 15 Kbytes However the original file is packed with Obsidium which makes the binary size grow to more than 400 KbytesThe SgnitLoader contains a few hardcoded domains in its binary to which it appends the path and adds a number from 1 to 7 Unlike the FormatLoader malware it doesnt use a format string but simply adds a number to the end of the string in order to get the full URLAfter the download and execute procedures are completed SgnitLoader pings back to the CC with a GET request The original pingback URL is hidden with the iploggerorg URL shortener serviceAnother small Trojan-Downloader written in C Its binary is half the size of SgnitLoader Its main function code is fairly short and it uses the IP Logger URL shortener service to hide the original URL that it downloads the payload from Thats why its called ShortLoaderShortLoader Main functionThe original file is an Inno Setup installer that utilizes Inno Download Plugin download functionalityThe setup script is programmed to download a file from the URL httponlinehuepletcom771exe placing it into the TEMP directory as dllhostwinexe and

After execution it drops three files a batch file an AutoIt interpreter with a stripped executable header and an AutoIt script Then it executes the batch file with cmdexe The task of the batch file is to restore the AutoIt interpreter executable and launch it with a path to the AutoIt script as a command line argumentAutoIt script performs a few AntiVM and AntiDebug checks If all the checks are successful then it starts AutoIt interpreter once again decrypts and decompresses the embedded executable and injects it into the newly created process The injected executable is

It was discovered at the beginning of 2019 Initially it was distributed as a cleaning tool called Garbage Cleaner or G-Cleaner through a fake website mimicking popular cleaning tools like CCleaner The main loader was used to download potentially unwanted applications together with malware such as Azorult Vidar PredatorTheThief miners and so on GCleaner is now distributed by various crack websites along with other malware This PPI platform uses CC-based geolocation targeting meaning it can push different malware depending on the victims IP address Although the GCleaner loader is no longer mimicking cleaning tools there are some still remnants of this in its binary code such as encrypted strings like SoftwareGCleanerStarted or GarbageCleaner The sample of GCleaner that we detected when analyzing this campaign was trying to download the Vidar password stealerVidar is an info-stealer It downloads DLL files freebl3dll mozgluedll msvcp140dll nss3dll softokn3dll and vcruntime140dll from

        "text": "Since 2009 Lazarus Group known to be a group of hackers in North Korea has been attacking not only Korea but various countries of America Asia and Europe According to AhnLabs ASD AhnLab Smart Defense infrastructure in early 2022 the Lazarus Group performed APT Advanced Persistent Threat attacks on Koreas defense finance media and pharmaceutical industriesAhnLab closely tracked these APT attacks and discovered that these attacks incapacitate security products in the attack process An analysis of the attack process revealed that the Lazarus Group exploits an old version of the INITECH process to perform the initial compromise before downloading and executing the rootkit malware from the attackers serverThe rootkit malware identified in the recent product-disabling attack abused vulnerable driver kernel modules to directly read and write to the kernel memory area and accordingly all monitoring systems inside the system including AV Anti-Virus were disabledThis technique is called the BYOVD Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver method and is known to be performed mainly on vulnerable driver modules of hardware supply companies With the latest Windows OS unsigned drivers can longer be loaded however attackers can use such legally-signed vulnerable drivers to control kernel area easilyThe vulnerable driver module used by the Lazarus Group in this case was a hardware-related module manufactured by ENE Technology This module used the original form of an open source library called WinIO developed by Yariv Kaplan in 1999 The problems with this module include not only the fact that it uses an old open source code but also the fact that the verification condition for calling modules is weak which enables reading and writing to an arbitrary kernel memory area via a simple bypassing processThus the attacker was able to read and write to an arbitrary kernel memory area through this module and by modifying data in all areas related to the kernel

        "title": "The Metador Enigma Unveiling an Unattributed Threat",
        "text": "By Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade Amitai Ben Shushan Ehrlich and Aleksandar MilenkoskiThe term Magnet of Threats is used to describe targets so desirable that multiple threat actors regularly cohabitate on the same victim machine in the course of their collection In the process of responding to a series of tangled intrusions at one of these Magnets of Threats SentinelLabs researchers encountered an entirely new threat actor We dubbed this threat actor Metador in reference to the string I am meta in one of their malware samples and the expectation of Spanish-language responses from the command-and-control serversThe intrusions we uncovered were located primarily in telcos ISPs and universities in the Middle East and Africa We believe that weve only seen a small portion of the operations of whats clearly a long-running threat actor of unknown originThroughout our analysis we retrieved and analyzed examples of two different malware platforms used by MetadormetaMain and Mafalda These Windows-based platforms are intended to operate entirely in-memory and never touch disk in an unencrypted fashion eluding native security products and standard Windows configurations with relative ease The internal versioning of Mafalda suggests that this platform has been in use for some time and its adaptability during our engagement alone highlights active and continuing developmentWe also found indications of additional implantsPart of the difficulty in tracking the breadth of Metadors operations involves their strict adherence to infrastructure segmentation The attackers use a single IP per victim and buildAttributing Metador remains a garbled mystery We encountered multiple languages with diverse idiosyncrasies indicative of multiple developers There are indications of a separation between developers and operators and despite a lack of samples the version history for at least one of the platforms suggests a history of development that extends far beyond the intrusions weve uncoveredThe Magnet of Threats in question deployed our XDR solution after theyd been infected by Metador for several months As such we have no indication of the original infection vector employed in this or other infectionsOnce on the target the Metador operators can choose between multiple execution flows to load one or more of their modular frameworks The execution flow used on our Magnet of Threats combines a WMI persistence mechanism with an unusual LOLbin in order to kick off the decryption of a multi-mode in-memory implant we named metaMainmetaMain is a feature-rich backdoor but in this case the Metador operators used the metaMain implant to decrypt a subsequent modular framework called Mafalda into memoryMafalda is a flexible interactive implant supporting over 60 commands It appears to be a highly-valuable asset to the Metador operators with newer variants exhibiting intense obfuscation making them challenging to analyzemetaMain is an implant framework used to maintain long-term access to compromised machines It provides operators with extensive functionality like keyboard and mouse event logging screenshot theft file download and upload and the ability to execute arbitrary shellcodeThe backdoor is keenly aware of its own execution context and runs in one of two modes as a result The developers designate these modes by writing out either I am meta or I am main to a log We chose to name the platform metaMain in reference to these two modesAs the name suggests this execution scheme relies on CDB the Microsoft Console Debugger to carry out the execution process Within this method there are two possible variations based on whether the implant is invoked in meta- or main-mode We witnessed its use in meta-mode turning the metaMain implant into a glorified loader for a Mafalda implantFive to six minutes after booting up the event triggers the execution of a LOLbin cdbexeThe attackers used the following command lineA debugging script cdbini is used to inject a small amount of shellcode into the debugged process in order to load metaMain The shellcode reads decrypts and executes metaMains reflective DLL Loader from cwindowssystem32SpeechSpeech02db The DLLs sole purpose is to then read decrypt and load the metaMain orchestrator stored as Speech03dbWhen invoked in meta-mode metaMain serves as a loader for the payload provided as an argument following -module In our observed case the executed module was fcache13db an encrypted Mafalda payloadThe Mafalda implant extends the backdoor functionalities that metaMain provides and is an actively maintained ongoing project We observed two variants of the Mafalda backdoorThe newer Obfuscated Mafalda variant extends the number of supported commands from 54 to 67 and is rife with anti-analysis techniques that make analysis extremely challengingInterestingly we noted that Mafalda prints encrypted debugger messages if the name of the host is WIN-K4C3EKBSMMI possibly indicating the name of the computer used by the developersIf Mafalda successfully establishes a connection to the C2 server it builds and sends an initial packet containing information about the host environment and the version of Mafalda being run Mafalda then executes in a loop exchanging packets with the C2 serverEach packet is of a given type and subtype uniquely identified by identification numbers internally refered to as outer OPC and inner OPC respectivelyThe Mafalda backdoor has a total of 67 commands with 13 of these added in the newer variant indicating that the Mafalda implant is a maintained ongoing projectand sends the content to the C2 with a name prefixed with lootThe functionalities of the backdoor commands have a very broad scope and include credential theft data and information theft command execution system registry and file system manipulation and Mafalda reconfigurationWhen the TCP KNOCK communication method is enabled the metaMain and Mafalda implants can establish an indirect connection to the C2 server through another implant On Windows systems this implant is internally referred to as Cryshell metaMain and Mafalda authenticate themselves to Cryshell through a port-knocking and handshake procedureMafalda also supports retrieval of data from Linux machines with another implant that sends data to the C2 as part of a packet with a name prefixed with lootlinux Though its possible that this unnamed Linux implant and Cryshell are the same Mafalda authenticates itself to the Linux implant through a different port-knocking and handshake procedureIn all Metador intrusions weve observed the operators use a single external IP address per victim network That IP is utilized for command-and-control over either HTTP metaMain Mafalda or raw TCP Mafalda In all confirmed instances the servers were hosted on LITESERVER a Dutch hosting providerIn addition to HTTP external Mafalda C2 servers also support raw TCP connections over port 29029 We also observed some of Metadors infrastructure host an SSH server at an unusual port While SSH is commonly used for remote access to nix systems we find it hard to believe that a mature threat actor would expose their infrastructure in such a way Instead its likely those were used to tunnel traffic through Mafaldas internal portfwd commandsWe were able to identify one additional server we believe is operated by Metador actors also hosted on Liteserver 527814 This IP hosts what appears to be a malicious domain networkselfhelpcom which might have been used as a C2 for Metador intrusions If so its an indication that Metador operators not only utilize IPs for their intrusions but also domainsThe limited number of intrusions and long-term access to targets suggests that the threat actors primary motive is espionage Moreover the technical complexity of the malware and its active development suggest a well-resourced group able to acquire maintain and extend multiple frameworksMetador was observed mainly in Telecoms Internet Service Providers ISP and Universities in the Middle East and Africa and appears intended to provide long-term access in multiple redundant waysMafalda internal documentation suggests the implant is maintained and developed by a dedicated team leaving comments for a separate group of operatorsRunning into Metador is a daunting reminder that a different class of threat actors continues to operate in the shadows with impunity Previous threat intelligence discoveries have broadened our understanding of the kind of threats that are out there but so far our collective ability to track these actors remains inconsistent at best Developers of security products in particular should take this as an opportunity to proactively engineer their solutions towards monitoring for the most cunning well-resourced threat actors High-end threat actors are thriving in a market that primarily rewards compliance and perfunctory detectionsFrom the perspective of the threat intelligence research community we are deeply grateful for the contributions of the research teams and service providers who have willingly shared their expertise and telemetry for this researchGet notified when we post new contentThanks Keep an eye out for new contentIn the era of interconnectivity when markets geographies and jurisdictions merge in the melting pot of the digital domain the perils of the threat ecosystem become unparalleled Crimeware families achieve an unparalleled level of technical sophistication APT

carrying out threat hunting activities The team has also observed the stealer malware being advertised on Russian-speaking hacker forumsThe malware sample we have analyzed is a 32-bit executable binary It contains obfuscated contents to evade detection by security products and firewalls The malicious executable decrypts the obfuscated contents by using XORing logic after which it drops the 32-bit Erbium stealer DLL binary in the temp location and loads that dropped file in the current process by calling LoadLibraryA API The dropped DLL files establish a connection to the Erbium stealer C2 server Erbium malware establishes the connection to Discords Content Delivery Network CDN servers Discord is a chat program that enables real-time communication between users through the internet and is being abused by threat actors to deliver malware Info stealer malware developers sell these types of malware in underground forums and sell the harvest details in underground forums as well as criminal marketplaces Ransomware affiliates or other threat actors purchase such details and then use these valid credentials VPN etc as initial access to compromise the organizationThe malware ErbiumStealer has the following capabilitiesRecently CYFIRMAs research team detected a new sample of Erbium stealer in wild We observed one of the recent gaming campaigns where the threat actors lure gamersplayers who want to acquire an unfair or prohibited edge over other players with the malicious binary posted on MediaFire free service for file hosting Threat actors are spreading this malware using drive-by-download techniques and pretending as cracked softwaregame hacks CYFIRMAs research team on further monitoring activities associated with this campaign conclude that the identity of the threat actor is currently unknown for this Erbium stealer malware sampleErbium stealer malware is an information stealer designed to gather sensitive data including passwords for applications credit card numbers web browser cookies auto-complete data desktop files machine data installed software crypto wallet stealing etc and send those details to the attacker command control C2 domain and can even download additional payloads from the C2 serverFrom our analysis we were able to find the following functionality available in the sampleIn recent years information stealers are one of the most popular malware types being used in the wild Once the info stealers threat actor obtains the harvested information from victim systems the threat actorsmalware authors will act as an initial access brokerIAB These threat actors advertised those obtained details on the dark web such as breachedto as well as Russian language underground forum of XSS and special-access forums along with cybercriminals marketplaces Threat actors such as ransomware affiliates or other threat actors purchase these details If a threat actor purchases these details they have access to a variety of resources which could lead to data exfiltration lateral movement and deploy other malware such as ransomware etc Even though there are other approaches such as exploiting flaws in publicly accessible internet services the use of stealer malware can cut down on costs and operation time This is because this malware can access a system with valid credentials without hiring pen-testers for gaining initial access to the organizations network which reduces the risk of being discovered by perimeter protection systemsA wide range of threat actors leverages commodity information stealers which are distributed as MaaS model that will be sold on the underground forum for USD prices based on a subscription basis For example Red Line stealers prices range from USD 100 to USD 300Another type of information stealer is private information stealers which are developed by threat actors themselves by using already available stealer code on open-source platforms or developing creating brand-new information stealers whenever the commodity information stealers do not fulfill threat actors requirements private information stealers will be shared among a small set of cyber-criminals only for reduces the chances of detection For example recently CYFIRMAs research team observed Whisper Stealer selling on the underground forum for USD100 for a 1-month subscription This stealer is C Net-based malware having the capabilities are collected from browsers user credentials cookies autofill fields credit cards wallets etcJust like the information stealer developers who sell malware samples developed by them in the underground forums the malware developers also post their advertisements in the underground forum for selling the obtained logs from victims to cybercriminalsThe Erbium stealer malware is being sold on one of the Russian hacker forums at 500 Rubles per week 1500 Rubles per month and 10000 Rubles per year The Erbium stealer team is running the technical support as

the discord app You may visit the link httpswwwcyfirmacomcyber-research-on-the-malicious-use-of-discord to get more in-depth knowledge that how threat actors use the application as a tool for malicious purposesThis information stealer malware is decrypting the obfuscated code by the XOR logic to decode the encrypted code malware authors use the starting key 31Hexadecimal value Depending upon the obfuscated content length the decryption keys are incrementing by 1 Before executing the malicious code this malware initially decrypts the Erbium Stealer panel URLMalware authors scatter the obfuscated contents as well as decryption logic code in the binary file to make it difficult for reverse engineering as well as writing the pattern signature to detect this malware by the antivirus engineIt is followed by the malware getting the temp path by calling the GetTempPathA API then it creates a malicious DLL file along with a legitimate DLL file in the temp folder by calling the CreateFileA APINext the malicious executable writes the malicious DLL binary file content from the buffer to the created DLL file by calling WriteFile APIOnce the malicious DLL file content has been written from the buffer to this file handle the malware closes the handle and then decodes the required API function by executing above mentioned XOR logic After that this malicious DLL file loads

about a new for-sale listing that appeared on his forumA seller called Data who Pompompurin says he will vouch all day and night for listed user data from AskFM ASKfm the social networking siteIm selling the users database of Askfm and askcom Data wrote For connoisseurs you can also get 607 repositories plus their Gitlab Jira Confluence databasesThere are about 350 million records in the database with about 45 million of them using Single Sign-On loginThe fields in the user database include userid username mail hash salt fbid twitterid vkid fbuid iguid and the hashes are reportedly crackableData who joined the forum in March also provided a list of repositories and sample git and sample user dataDataBreaches reached out to Data to ask some questions about when the data were acquired and how DataBreaches also reached out to AskFM last night to ask them some questionsAskFM didnt reply to either of two inquiries over a 24 hour period but Data did respond to this sites questions with two prefacatory remarks The first was to berate yours truly for having a protonmail account The second was a request to please add Marine Le Pen is a racist fraudsterHaving dealt with those remarks lets turn to the clarification Data provided on the AskFM incidentIn response to the first query about initial access Data replied that there was a vulnerability in Safety Center the server contained a WordPress site on their ASKFM-NET networkAs to when the hack occurred Data replied that the server was first accessed in 2019 and the database was obtained on 2020-03-14 Data provided this site with users on the Safety Center and wrote insultingly about a certain lazy administrator who allegedly used the same password everywhereNote Data provided specific and technical details that DataBreaches is not reproducing in this post out of concern that they might encourage or enable others to re-attack AskFM According to Data AskFM is still vulnerable due to a poor response to the 2020 incidentSpecific parts were taken in 2021 although they assumed the aggressors were kicked off Data wrote The buyer will get specific details on how piss easy it is to compromise the moronsHow easy is piss easy you wonder Just need to open 10 source files and spot either a vulnerability or peek at the heavy password re-use Data told DataBreachesWhen asked whether AskFM knew about the breach in 2020 Data was unequivocal in stating that they knew AskFM noticed the March 2020 breach circa June 2020 Data claims but was apparently too busy laying off employees to give Answers to the attempt to contact themDatas claim that AskFM knew was based in part on AskFM burning some specific access the hackers had played around with like several production AWS credentials provided to DataBreachesDataBreaches could find no media coverage or other indication that AskFM ever disclosed the March 2020 breach or notified users of it If anyone ever received a notification about it please contact DataBreaches If AskFM replies to inquiries this post will be updatedBecause Data invited contacts by private message its not clear how many purchase offers they have received at this point but they tell DataBreaches that they are now looking more at a single exclusive saleUpdated 9212022 Because there has still been no reply by AskFM DataBreaches sent an inquiry to the Irish DPC asking whether AskFM ever reported the March 2020 incident to them under the GDPR This post will be updated when a reply to that inquiry is receivedUpdate and Correction of September 23To my surprise DataBreaches discovered that this site had already contacted Askfm about the claimed breach back in December 2021 They responded and for some reason probably linked to a neurological event last year that seriously impacted my memory I never published anything about it Today I found my draft post from that time still in Drafts unpublishedToday Askfm responded to my recent inquiriesAs you were advised in December 2021 Askfm has not suffered any security incidents We can confirm that this is still the case from our last communication until the present timeDataBreaches sincerely apologizes to AskFM for not remembering the December contact or their response at all That said DataBreaches does not apologize for trying to investigate such a large claimed breach In light of their response today DataBreaches is now publishing what was sitting in my Drafts folder since DecemberPart of previously unpublished draft from December 2021 Over the past week DataBreachesnet reached out Askfm several times by email and via their Twitter team to try to verify or refute claims about a hack that allegedly acquired more than 340 million records The person who informed DataBreachesnet about the alleged hack provided this site with samples of data that were purportedly from the firms internal networkAs this site routinely does Askfm were given a sample of the records from the larger sample this site had received so they had some sense of the data this site had been provided at least in part If it was not their data they could have simply responded that they investigated and found it wasnt their data But they didnt respond Because stonewalling is often an indication that there really has been a breach and the company is trying to cover it up or delay disclosure DataBreachesnet asked them why they had not posted anything on their website or notified anyone While the sample data appeared to be old data to DataBreachesnet knowing that people re-use passwords and that the hacker claimed to have internal reports meant that this might need to be disclosed andor reported to regulators especially since the hacker claimed to have data on 350 million users that included usernames email addresses and easy-to-crack passwordsAskfm has headquarters in California and Latvia and is registered in Dublin for GDPR purposesWhen Askfm finally responded their reply was as followsHiThank you for sharing this information We have provided it to law enforcement as it appears to be aiding and abetting an extortion attempt which has no valid foundation we have had no security incidents and law enforcement has been made aware of your emailBest regardsCommunications DepartmentSo why didnt they simply respond to the initial inquiry by saying that they have had no security incident Or ask for more data so they could investigateThis site repliedThanks for your response Journalists attempt to verify claims That is not aiding and abetting anything I will include your reply if and when I report on the claimed attack End of previously unpublished draftBut I never did report on the claim or their response it seems and truly had no memory of any of it To say that I was shocked to receive their email referring to past communication would be an understatementSo AskFM denies that there was any breach at all DataBreaches will not publish the technical details that this site had been provided but it will be interesting to see if Data reveals them For now however DataBreaches considers this claimed breach as disputedThey have a very rude team I discovered multiple vulnerabilities in AskFM website during 2021 and then I reported my findings Unfortunately I think they throw my report in the garbage nothing fixed and even there is no MFA option for all 350 million users That means a disaster if the leaked data is accurateComments are closedThis site doesnt accept sponsored posts and doesnt respond to requests about themEmailSignal 1 516-776-7756 2009 2023 DataBreachesnet

        "text": "Gamaredon APT actors likely gained initial footholds into targeted networks through malicious Microsoft Office documents distributed via email This is consistent with spear-phishing techniques common to this APTMalicious VBS macros concealed within remote templates execute when the user opens the document The macros download RAR archives containing LNK files The naming convention of the RAR archives in this campaign follows a similar patternThese compressed archives usually contain just the LNK file The LNK files and Microsoft Office document names contain references pertinent to the Russian invasion of UkraineThe instrumentor PowerShell script usually consists of a function that decodes the encrypted response from the command and control C2 server and executes it as a VBScript object The key used in the XOR decoder is calculated based on the machine's volume serial number plus index parameters passed in the response blob This method makes it difficult to decode the malicious content if an observer looking at the data doesn't have both parameters availableThe PowerShell script also repeatedly captures the current user's screen This code uses the SystemWindowsForms object to capture a copy of the virtual desktop including setups with multiple screens The screen capture is executed nine times but the resulting screenshot is always saved to TEMPtestpng which gets overwritten every time The resulting image PNG file is then converted to a base64-encoded string stored in a variable and the screenshot image file is removed from the diskThe script then proceeds to upload the victim's information to the remote server The following information is then collected and exfiltrated to a hardcoded C2 URLUpon sending the system information the server response is parsed to see if there are commands to be executed The entire script runs up to four times thus up to four different commands can be executed each timeThe code checks if the first character is an exclamation point If so the remainder of the response is expected to be a PowerShell code that is passed directly to the command IEX The output of that command is then added to the variable cmd and sent back to the C2 serverIf the response starts with any other character it is treated as an encrypted blob and passed to the decoder function along with the volume serial number to be decoded and executed as VBScriptOne of the payloads served to the instrumentor script was PowerShell code used to set an environmental variable with PowerShell code in it and a Registry RUN key to run every time the user logs inThere are two key components to this scriptThis script uses the same Get-IP function to get a random IP assigned to the domain and queries a URL constructed from the IP address and a hardcoded extended resource Just like the previous script the computer name and volume serial number are used again in communications with the C2 server The C2 server uses them to encode the next-stage payload subsequently served to the scriptIf the response from the C2 starts with the string http the content is treated as the URL to download the final payload binary The Volume Serial Number and Computer Name are passed to this URL and the response is decoded using the XorBytes functionThe decrypted binary is then saved to the TEMP folder with a name consisting of a random string of numbers and the exe file extension and is executedAlternatively if the response from the C2 does not begin with the http string the content is treated as a VBS and executed via a COM objectOne of the executables deployed by the attackers via the PowerShell script consisted of an information stealer that exfiltrates files of specific extensions from the infected endpoint doc docx xls rtf odt txt jpg jpeg pdf ps1 rar zip 7z and mdb This is a new infostealer that Gamaredon has not previously used in other campaigns We suspect it may be a component of Gamaredon's Giddome'' backdoor family but we are unable to confirm that at this timeThe malicious binary keeps track of what has been exfiltrated in a file named profilescini in the USERPROFILEAppdataLocal folder The malware stores the MD5 hash of a string containing the filename file size and modification date of the exfiltrated fileOnce started the malware scans all attached storage devices looking for files with the aforementioned extensions For each one the malware makes a POST request with metadata about the exfiltrated file and its contentThe parameter p contains metadata about the stolen file and the victim machine using the following formatusssssWhere the various parameters areHardcodedvalueFilenameFileModificationDatetimeFileSizeComputerNameUsernameVictimIDrandomlygeneratedstring12charsVolume Serial NumberThe raw content of the file comes after the metadata The request is made to a random URI under the parent C2 domain The implant generates a random 12-character string that acts as a subdomain for the C2 domain to send requests toEg random12charstringcelticsoruThe implant will also search for the relevant file extensions in fixed and remote drives and specifically in the CUsers folder The implant enumerates all the files recursively in the directories on the system while avoiding enumeration of any folder containing the following strings in the pathAvoiding these folders is likely an attempt by the malware to avoid exfiltrating system files thereby focussing on user files of interest onlyFor each file exfiltrated to the C2 the implant calculates the MD5 hash for the following information and stores it in the LocalAppDataprofilescini filefilepathFilesizeFilemodificationdatetimeThe implant also steals files from removable drives connected to the infected endpoint When the implant finds a removable drive it looks for files with the file extensions listed earlier Once a file is found the implant creates a randomly named folder in the TEMP directory and copies the

with combinations of products and servicesMitigate threats reduce risk and get back to business with the help of leading expertsMandiant specializes in cyber threat intelligence offering products services and more to support our mission to defend against cyber crimeGet the latest insights from cyber security experts at the frontlines of threat intelligence and incident responseLearn more about us and our mission to help organizations defend against cyber crimeUNC4034 established communication with the victim over WhatsApp and lured them to download a malicious ISO package regarding a fake job offering that led to the deployment of the AIRDRYV2 backdoor through a trojanized instance of the PuTTY utilityThis activity was identified by our Mandiant Intelligence Staging Directories mission which searches for anomalous files written to directories commonly used by threat actorsThe techniques used by UNC4034 in this compromise along with the techniques used in countless intrusions investigated by Mandiant are used to continuously develop and refine threat hunting hypotheses within Managed Defense These provide high fidelity and actionable leads that are informed by evolving threat actor tradecraftThe initial lead was a file downloaded to the host named amazonassessmentiso ISO and IMG archives have become attractive to threat actors because from Windows 10 onwards double-clicking these files automatically mounts them as a virtual disk drive and makes their content easily accessible This reduces the effort needed to view the embedded files compared to other formats such as RAR archives Detecting malicious IMG and ISO archives served via phishing attachments is routine for Mandiant Managed Defense The payloads contained within such archives range from commodity malware to advanced backdoors like the sample analyzed in this blog postMandiant Managed Defense performed an investigation on the host to determine how the file amazonassessmentiso was created Based on the available data Mandiant assesses that UNC4034 initiated communication with the victim by offering them a job opportunity at Amazon via email Subsequently UNC4034 communicated with them over WhatsApp and shared the file amazonassessmentiso which the user downloaded using the web version of WhatsAppThe amazonassessmentiso archive held two files an executable and a text file The text file named Readmetxt had connection details for use with the second file PuTTYexeServer 13718415189User testPass Redacted by MandiantThe size of the PuTTY binary downloaded by the victim is also substantially larger than the legitimate version Upon closer inspection it has a large high entropy data section in comparison to the officially distributed version Figure 3 Sections like these are typically indicative of packed or encrypted dataThe suspicious nature of the PuTTYexe embedded in the ISO file prompted Managed Defense to perform a deeper investigation on the host and the file itself The execution of the malicious PuTTY binary resulted in the deployment of a backdoor to the host The deployed backdoor is an evolution of the malware family Mandiant tracks as AIRDRY Mandiant Managed Defense successfully investigated the compromise and contained the host before follow-on activity resulting from the deployed backdoor could occur While Mandiant detected and responded to the compromise on 2022-07-05 the same PuTTY executable was seen on VirusTotal as early as 2022-06-27In addition Mandiant discovered a second ISO archive named amazontestiso uploaded to VirusTotal on 2022-06-17 Mandiant found the second archive by pivoting from the IP address contained in the Readmetxt file This ISO file also had a Readmetxt with the same IP address and a similar trojanized PuTTY executableBoth ISO files found by Mandiant appear to use the same lure theme by posing as a recruitment assessment for Amazon They also contained similarly constructed malware that resulted in a final AIRDRYV2 backdoor payloadEach sample contains malicious code that writes an embedded payload to disk and launches it However the malicious code was inserted at different locations in each of the trojanized PuTTY samples In the PuTTY sample discovered by Mandiant the code resides in the connecttohost function which is in the source file putty-077sshsshc To trigger the code the user must attempt an SSH connection to the host IP address provided in the Readmetxt file Figure 1 In the PuTTY sample discovered on VirusTotal the malicious code was inserted into the ssh2userauthprocessqueue function source file putty-077sshuserauth2-clientc The code resides in the part of the function responsible for performing password authentication as opposed to other methods such as public key or keyboard-interactive authentication Once the user establishes a connection and enters their username and password the malicious code is executed regardless of the authentication result These execution guardrails are likely an attempt by UNC4034 to avoid unnecessarily dropping the next stage of their malware The part of the malicious code that drops and executes a payload is nearly identical between the two samples The legitimate Windows executable CWindowsSystem32colorcplexe is copied to the new directory CProgramDataPackageColor and the embedded payload is written to CProgramDataPackageColorcoloruidll The PuTTY binary observed in the compromise launches coloruidll via DLL search order hijacking using the command shown in Figure 5In the VirusTotal sample cmdexe is not used to launch colorcplexe Instead the Windows API function WinExec launches the process shown in Figure 6In both instances the command-line argument passed to colorcplexe is not related to the legitimate function of the Windows executable Instead each argument is utilized by the malicious DLL as described belowPersistence is established for CProgramDataPackageColorcolorcplexe via schtasksexe A scheduled task named PackageColor executes colorcplexe at 1030AM local time every dayThe coloruidll samples were packed using the commercial software protector Themida The unpacked samples contain file paths that reveal their purpose An example path is shown in Figure 7Both samples contain an identical shellcode payload named DAVESHELL The payload is decrypted using a custom XOR-based algorithm with a dynamically generated key The key is the result of concatenating the following strings1 Parent process name COLORCPLEXE2 Malicious DLL filename COLORUIDLL3 Command-line argument passed to colorcplexe by the PuTTY executableThe necessary decryption key for the VirusTotal sample is shown in Figure 8The inclusion of this key also serves as an anti-analysis mechanism without the correct key nothing of significance happens when the DLL is executed The command-line argument passed to colorcplexe also dictates how the decrypted shellcode is executed Based on this argument coloruidll may execute the shellcode from within colorcplexe or inject it into a new instance of a legitimate Windows process In the case of process injection the injection target is chosen randomly between credwizexe or iexpressexeThe backdoors configuration is AES-128 encrypted in CBC mode with the hard-coded keyKAA5M8MNDKLJB8PI An integrity check is performed on both the encrypted and

SMB mode the backdoor communicates by sending an SMB2 WRITE request to a named pipe The host name and pipe name are specified in the configuration Like previous AIRDRY backdoors AIRDRYV2 utilizes the value 0x2040 to request a command from a C2 server Supported command IDs are listed in Table 3Command IDDescription0x2009Upload basic system information0x2028Update the beacon interval based on a

AIRDRY supported nearly thirty commands Of the nine commands only two were not present in previous AIRDRY samples 0x2052 and 0x2057 Command 0x2052 can be used to update the 32-byte sequence used to derive the AES-256 key described above Command ID 0x2057represents the shift from a backdoor that supportsnumerous commands to the new plugin-based approach in AIRDRYV2 Downloaded plugins are executed in memory and provided with a structure that includes a copy of the decrypted configuration the system ID and an object that facilitates communication with the configured C2 servers Notably the backdoor itself has the necessary logic to function as a pluginMandiant identified several overlaps between UNC4034 and threat clusters we suspect have a North Korean nexus The AIRDRYV2 C2 URLs belong to compromised website infrastructure previously leveraged by these groups and reported in several OSINT sources Of note is the prior use of this compromised infrastructure to deliver the AIRDRY backdoor via CUTELOOP downloaders embedded in malicious documentsThe investigation into this compromise revealed new leads and indicators to pivot from in future hunting efforts An important caveat to these hunting leads is that they are not indicators of compromise Instead they are interesting activity that may call for further investigation by an analystThese include ISO and IMG archive files downloaded from sources such as WhatsApp email providers and cloud storage services On Windows 10 and later the origin URL of a downloaded file is stored in the ZoneIdentifier alternate data stream Mandiant routinely observes archive files delivered as phishing attachments that originate from those sourcesThe second hunting lead is the execution of colorcplexe from an unusual directory like CProgramDataPackageColor Most often the executable runs from its standard location in CWindowsSystem32 or CWindowsSysWOW64The third hunting lead found for future hunting efforts is the execution of colorcplexe with command-line arguments By default colorcplexe executes with no command line arguments In this scenario colorcplexe was executed with a command-line argument that consisted of hexadecimal characters The argument was ultimately evaluated by a malicious DLL that was loaded into the processMandiant consistently finds new and novel threat actor activity such as the one described in this blog post To ensure our customers are protected Mandiants detection and threat hunting capabilities are continuously evolving and are fueled by our experiences on the

files it appears multiple copies of the PDF file were created alongside multiple txt files with the same content While other copies of the PDF were deleted a copy remained in the threat actors staging directory This oversight resulted in the disclosure of information that could reveal the identity of an individual engaged in COBALT MIRAGE activity The metadata of the Hipdf ransom note indicates that the document was created on December 17 2021 by ahmad khatibi in a UTC 330 time zone see Figure 1 This time zone corresponds to Iran Standard Time IRST The timestamp appears to be authenticFigure

allegations appear to reinforce that the creator reference in the ransom note is legitimate and is not a false flag implicating an unrelated individual Operational security failures revealing attribution is not uncommon with Iranian cyber operations Past examples documented by CTU researchers include the identification of a developer linked to malicious Iranian activity and Iranian malware developers infecting their own system and disclosing screenshots of their development environments on the internetIn April 2022 LabDookhtegan reported via their Telegram and Twitter channels that Iranian company Najee Technology and Secnerd also operate on behalf of the IRGC-IO see Figure 3Figure 3 Tweet alleging connections among Najee Technology Secnerd and the IRGC Source SecureworksThe

IRGC-IO Source SecureworksThe model of Iranian government intelligence functions using contractors blurs the lines between the actions tasked by the government and the actions that the private company takes on its own initiative While part of COBALT MIRAGE activity appears espionage-focused a significant portion is focused on opportunistic revenue generation through its ransomware activities While these companies may work with the IRGC-IO the ransomware attacks could be another source of revenue that they can pursue without fear of prosecution by Iranian law enforcement Other Iranian threat groups such as COBALT SAPLING also known as Moses Staff and COBALT SHADOW also known as Agrius and BlackShadow have made use of ransomware in their attacks However the primary intent of these attacks appeared to be disruption and harassment of the victim rather than revenue generation Although the ProxyShell vulnerabilities were disclosed in August 2021 COBALT MIRAGE continues to have success exploiting them to compromise organizations CTU researchers advise organizations to routinely validate that all internet-facing systems are appropriately patched and take swift mitigating actions where gaps are foundTo mitigate exposure to this malware CTU researchers recommend that organizations use available controls to review and restrict access using the indicators listed in Table 1 Note

Agency CISA the National Security Agency NSA US Cyber Command USCC - Cyber National Mission Force CNMF the Department of the Treasury Treasury the Australian Cyber Security Centre ACSC the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security CCCS and the United Kingdoms National Cyber Security Centre NCSC to highlight continued malicious cyber activity by advanced persistent threat APT actors that the authoring agencies assess are affiliated with the Iranian Governments Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC Note The IRGC is an Iranian Government agency tasked with defending the Iranian Regime from perceived internal and external threats Hereafter this advisory refers to all the coauthors of this advisory as the authoring agenciesThe IRGC-affiliated actors are actively targeting a broad range of entities including entities across multiple US critical infrastructure sectors as well as Australian Canadian and United Kingdom organizations These actors often operate under the auspices of Najee Technology Hooshmand Fater LLC based in Karaj Iran and Afkar System Yazd Company based in Yazd Iran The authoring agencies assess the actors are exploiting known vulnerabilities on unprotected networks rather than targeting specific targeted entities or sectorsThis advisory provides observed tactics techniques and indicators of compromise IOCs that the authoring agencies assess are likely associated with this IRGC-affiliated APT The authoring agencies urge organizations especially critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this advisory to mitigate risk of compromise from these IRGC-affiliated cyber actorsThe IRGC-affiliated actors have used their access for ransom operations including disk encryption and extortion efforts After gaining access to a network the IRGC-affiliated actors likely determine a course of action based on their perceived value of the data Depending on the perceived value the actors may encrypt data for ransom andor exfiltrate data The actors may sell the data or use the exfiltrated data in extortion operations or double extortion ransom operations where a threat actor uses a combination of encryption and data theft to pressure targeted entities to pay ransom demandsIRGC-affiliated actor activity observed by the authoring agencies includesThe authoring agencies assess the following tactics and techniques are associated with this activityThe following IOCs observed as of March 2022 are indicative of ProxyShell vulnerability exploitation on targeted entity networksThe following IOCs observed as of December 2021 are indicative of Log4j vulnerability exploitation on targeted entity networksThe authoring agencies have observed the IRGC-affiliated actors dumping and subsequently exfiltrating the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service LSASS process memory on targeted entity networks in furtherance of credential harvesting The following IOCs are associated with data exfiltration from targeted entity networksThe authoring agencies recommend that organizations using Microsoft Exchange servers Fortinet devices andor VMware Horizon applications investigate potential suspicious activity in their networksThe authoring agencies urge network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats immediately by implementing the mitigations belowIn addition to applying mitigations the authoring agencies recommend exercising testing and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATTCK for Enterprise framework in this advisory The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATTCK techniques described in this advisoryTo get startedThe authoring agencies recommend continually testing your security program at scale in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATTCK techniques identified in this advisoryIf a ransomware or extortion incident occurs at your organizationNote The authoring agencies strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and records will be

name While Proofpoint has previously observed TA453 using compromised email accounts to send phishing emails Proofpoint has no specific indication that these spoofed individuals were victimized by TA453 Additionally Proofpoint regularly sees TA453 pair the same spoofed person with different actor-controlled email addressesIn almost all cases TA453 would engage in one-to-one conversations with their targets but this changed in mid-2022Proofpoint researchers observed a shift in TA453's approach starting in June 2022 In this first campaign Figure 1 TA453 started the conversation masquerading as Aaron Stein Director of Research at FRPI The actor included a variety of questions intended to generate a dialogue about Israel the Gulf States and the Abraham Accords While these questions are generally meant to establish a pretext for sending a follow-up credential harvesting link or to deliver a malicious document it is also possible they represent intelligence questions tasked to TA453In the email TA453's Aaron Stein launched the threat actor's use of Multi-Persona Impersonation MPI by referring to and including a Richard Wike director of global attitudes research at PEW Research Center on the CC lineFigure 1 TA453 email posing as an Aaron Stein Director of Research at FRPIA day after the initial email Richard Wike responded Figure 2 to the email thread likely in an attempt to establish the veracity of the request and solicit a response from the target In this case no malicious documents or links were observedFigure 2 TA453 follow-up email using another personaFigure 3 Screenshot of TA453 using one of its cc'd personas to further the ruse targeting a medical researcherGroup ProjectIn June 2022 TA453's Carroll Doherty persona reached out to a prominent academic involved in nuclear arms control about a possible US versus Russia clash This campaign ended up representing an evolution of TA453's MPI technique as the persona did not stop at reaching out to just one target but reached out to two targets at the same university Carroll also cc'd three other TA453 personas on the email Daniel Krcmaric Aaron Stein and Sharan GrewalFigure 4 Timeline of TA453's Group Project email campaignOne of the targets responded initially to the outreach email but then ghosted Carroll After the target failed to respond for a little over a week Carroll kindly provided a OneDrive link to the article referenced in the original email Figure 5 The link downloaded a document titled The possible US-Russia clashdocx SHA256

and followed up with the target to let them know the document is secure because it cannot be read without the password Four days later one of the cc'd TA453 personas Aaron Stein dropped Carroll from the email thread apologized to the target and resent the same OneDrive link and password Figure 6Figure 6 A cc'd TA453 persona attempting to convince a target of the legitimacy of the campaignSimilar to the document sent by Harald this document also used remote template injection to downloadKorgAt this time Proofpoint has only observed the beaconing information and has not observed any follow-on exploitation capabilities The lack of code execution or command and control capabilities within the TA453 macros is abnormal Proofpoint judges that infected users may be subject to additional exploitation based on the software identified on their machinesProofpoint tracks multiple subgroups of TA453 differentiated primarily by victimology techniques and infrastructure Some subgroups in their typical campaigns will engage in benign conversations with targets for weeks before delivering malicious links Conversely another subgroup tends to immediately send a malicious link in the initial emailWhile the mere presence of specific indicators does not definitively condemn an email as TA453 indicators of a possible TA453-linked persona includeAll threat actors are in constant states of iterating their tools tactics and techniques TTPs advancing some while deprecating others The use of MPI by TA453 while the group's latest technique is likely to continue to evolve and morph as this group hunts for intelligence in support of the IRGC Proofpoint researchers have already started to observe this potential next step with TA453 attempting to send a blank email then respond to the blank email all while including all their friends on the CC line This is likely the threat actor's attempt at bypassing security detectionResearchers involved in international security particularly those specializing in Middle Eastern studies or nuclear security should maintain a heightened sense of awareness when receiving unsolicited emailsFor example experts that are approached by journalists should check the journalists or their publications website to see if the email address belongs to themSubscribe to the Proofpoint Blog"

        "title": "Attacking the Android kernel using the Qualcomm TrustZone Tamir Zahavi-Brunners Blog",
        "text": "Sep 14 2022In this post I describe a somewhat unique Android kernel exploit which utilizes the TrustZone in order to compromise the kernelCVE-2021-1961 is a vulnerability I discovered in the communication protocol of Qualcomms TrustZone QSEE It allows you to corrupt memory management data in the protocol which I exploited into instructing the TrustZone to modify the Android kernel memory thus achieving arbitrary readwrite primitives over physical memory addresses I turned this powerful primitive into a reliable exploit that works out of the box without the need to be adapted per deviceversionThe bulk of communication between Android and QSEE is done between Android user mode programs and QSEE user mode programs which are known as trustlets In order to send a command to a trustlet an Android user mode program will call an ioctl of the qseecom kernel module devqseecom which will then send it to the QSEE kernel which will in turn send it to the relevant trustlet The response will go through the same components in reverse orderPart of the TrustZone technology allows certain regions of physical memory to be carved out as secure meaning that only the Secure World can access them This means that there are certain regions even the Linux kernel cant accessOn the QSEE side the QSEE kernel is accessible to everything including the Normal World memory The QSEE kernel does limit the trustlets so by default each trustlet can only access a small chunk of secure memory which is its ownHowever in order to allow Android user mode programs to communicate with trustlets efficiently there is a way for them to share memoryThis protocol is not always enough Some trustlets need to readwrite to memory that comes from other ION heaps To solve this a command that needs a trustlet to access another ION buffer would have a pointer to that ION buffer inside the input bufferHowever to do this there are two issues that need to be solvedNow the QSEE kernel receives the whitelist entries alongside the inputoutput buffers When parsing them for each whitelist entry it goes to the input buffer and reads the address at the specified offset It then gives the trustlet access to whitelists the memory from that address and for the size specified in the whitelist entryTo explain this in a more graphical way here is how the data in the ioctl would look likeAnd this is how the data passed from qseecom to the QSEE kernel would look likeThe bug is that there is no check to make sure addresses of different ION buffers dont end up overlapping each other If you do provide qseecom with two ION file descriptors with offsets that cause their addresses to overlap each other you can cause one whitelist entry to point at a corrupted address which does not belong to any ION buffer this will get that address whitelisted for the trustletFor example lets take the diagram from above but this time add another ION buffer to the ioctl When qseecom writes the second ION buffers address to the input buffer it would look like thisBut when we look at what the first whitelist entry now points to it would look like thisIts 0x4444444433333333 and not 0x3333333344444444 because its little endianAt this point I realized that if the command I send to the trustlet instructs it to modify memory at the specified address I can get it to modify memory at that corrupted address And if the corrupted address happens to contain kernel memory that could result in privilege escalationAs can be seen in the diagrams above there is actually a side effect in what I described By partially overwriting an address data around it also gets corrupted In the diagram you can see that the 0xaaaa and 0xbbbb were overwritten with 0x44444444While I could have stuck to only overlapping addresses fully and not partially I did want more flexibility than that in my exploitI realized that I could actually increase the size of the input buffer more than what the trustlet needs and no error would occur The trustlet would just read all the data it needs and then ignore the rest This means that I could perform all the address manipulations at the end of the input buffer not touching any data that the trustlet is going to readThis does mean that I would need to know the physical address I want the trustlet to modify beforehand so I can write it where the trustlet does expect a pointer instead of letting qseecom do it but this is also something I am going to solveNow that I figured out how to easily trigger the vulnerability without side effects I sat down to think about what would be the best way to manipulate addresses in order to exploit it I realized that there is one more detail here which I havent really touched yetUp until now Ive only discussed how the input buffer can contain pointers to ION buffers that are contiguous in physical memory but ION buffers can also be non-contiguous only being contiguous in virtual memory This usually depends on which heap the ION buffer was allocated fromTo explain it in a more graphical way here is a diagram of how it would look likeFrom the vulnerability point of view this is very interesting This allows me to also manipulate the size of a whitelisted buffer as well as the addressAt this point I stopped to think about my objective here I know I can get kernel memory whitelisted but the question is what should I try to whitelist After thinking for a while I figured Why not just try to whitelist the whole kernel memoryOne thing that came up useful here is prociomem This pseudo-file shows what different regions of physical memory are used for Heres a snippet from its outputI figured that managing to whitelist all of Kernel code and Kernel data should be enough even though its technically not the whole kernel memory as it doesnt include dynamically allocated memoryOne more thing I had to take into account before I started to construct a technique was the limit of 4 ION buffers per request which means I couldnt just use as many as I want More than that I figured that it would be very useful to have one normal ION buffer per request to allow me to have one pointer to data I fully control which narrowed me to using only 3 ION buffers in my techniqueAt this point I started observing the physical addresses I got for ION buffers I allocated trying different sizes and different heaps I found interesting behaviors for the system and the qsecom heaps which I used in my exploitThis gave me an idea I could use an address from the qsecom heap to overwrite the size of one of the whitelisted chunks Since the address fits in 32 bits it would overwrite the size completely zeroing the following 4 bytes but that doesnt really matter Then if I can zero the address of that chunk completely or maybe reduce it to a very low number it means I would whitelist everything from 0 until somewhere after Kernel code and Kernel dataNow the question I was left with is how to make the address of a chunk become zeroI figured that if I manage to get a system ION buffer whose physical addresses all have zeroes as their 4 higher bytes I could zero their 4 lower bytes using the 4 higher bytes of the qsecom ION buffer to reach an address that is all zeroesAnyway for my exploit I used QSEECOMIOCTLSENDMODFDCMDREQ The key here is that for this ioctl there is a check in qseecom to make sure that all physical addresses of ION buffers passed to it fit in 32 bits If this check fails then the ioctl fails Since there is really no other reason for the ioctl to fail I can assume that a failure in this ioctl means that the ION buffer has a physical address that doesnt fit in 32 bitsAt this point I can kind of spray ION buffers basically continue allocating ION buffers from the system heap and running them through this ioctl The first one that doesnt fail fits in 32 bitsNote that this is the least reliable part of my exploit because in theory you could just end up allocating more and more ION buffers without ever reaching one that fits in 32 bits From my experience though all you really need here is just a bit of patienceSo I have a technique to whitelist all of the kernel code and data lets sum it upAdd the system ION buffer with a far offset after the data that the trustlet reads lets say 0x100 At this point the input buffer should look like thisAdd the qsecom ION buffer with an offset of 0x108 so it overwrites the size field of the first entry in the array So now the input buffer should look like thisAdd the same qsecom ION buffer once more but this time with an offset of 0x9c so it zeroes the lower 4 bytes of the address Now the input buffer should look like thisGranting the trustlet to access all of the kernel code and data is great but its still not enough I needed to figure out how to make the trustlet perform the modifications I want it to make to the kernel memorySo at this point I had one final thing to figure out in order to achieve kernel readwrite Find a command in a trustlet that gives me as much control over data being pointed to in the command ideally something that copies memory from one place to another Unfortunately this turned out to be quite a headacheI started looking at the possible trustlets I could use and immediately realized there is one issue here I was working on Pixel devices and the thing about Pixel devices is that compared to other vendors they dont have a lot of trustlets on them But to be honest this is actually both bad and good Of course bad because I dont have a lot of trustlets to look for a copy functionality in but good because I can pretty much expect all of the trustlets on a Pixel device to also exist on other devices which makes my exploit more device-genericAt this point it didnt take me long to narrow my search to the Widevine trustlet All other trustlets barely have any functionality that deals with pointers so it was easy to rule them out Widevine on the other hand is full of functionality so although its very complex I realized I pretty much had to use it for my exploitThe issue I kept facing is that even though the trustlet is full of functionality it was very hard to reach it Almost all of my commands kept failing due to one check or another before I could reach any interesting functionality And remember I wasnt even trying to do anything malicious at this point just trying to run valid commandsThe bottom line is that reversing Widevine was quite a challenge in itself but Im going to leave it out of the scope of this blog post since I dont want to make it too long I did end up learning quite a lot about Widevine so if you are interested in reversing Widevine yourself let me know I might publish a separate blog post just about thisAnyway after a lot of work reversing Widevine I found commands that allowed me both to encrypt memory and decrypt memory with the same symmetrical key This was good enough for me because if you think about it encrypt decrypt with the same symmetrical key is just copy with extra stepsFor arbitrary readFor arbitrary writeOne little caveat regarding the encryptdecrypt commands is that the size of each operation has to be aligned to the size of an AES block which is 16 bytes But this is actually barely an issue It is not really a problem to read a few bytes more than needed and if I want to write something that doesnt align I can always read what was in there beforehand so when writing I can make sure the extra memory is kept unchangedNow was the time to test my arbitrary kernel readwrite I found the physical address of the global variable that decides if SELinux is enabled changed it to 0 and it worked I finally had a working exploit While this was indeed quite satisfying I figured that since this exploit is super reliable and the primitive of arbitrary physical memory readwrite is very powerful I could push it even further At this point to make the exploit work I needed to adapt it per build as I needed to know the physical addresses of the symbols I wanted to modify and these change per build I wanted to avoid this part and make my exploit work on different builds and even different devices out of the boxOne issue with kallsyms is that it gives you virtual addresses not physical But since it also has a symbol for the virtual base I could subtract it from any other virtual address I found in order to determine its physical addressThats it At this point my exploit code worked and disabled SELinux on different devices and versions without needing adaptations I also decided to change the string returned from procversion just to demonstrate that since I have access through physical memory its just as easy for me to modify read-only memory as it is to modify readwrite memoryHeres a quick review of all the steps in the exploitLets talk a bit about Android kernel exploitationmitigation techniques I havent really discussed mitigations yet and I think its actually for a very good reason At no point have I really encountered a mitigation I needed to bypass when writing this exploitThe bottom line is that since this exploit deals with physical memory all kernel mitigations dont really apply Addresses are not randomized by ASLR which makes it much simpler to gain full control over kernel memory and once I do have such control I dont really care about code execution mitigations such as CFI or stack cookiesEven thinking about the future looking into the much-discussed MTE I havent tried but I do believe that such exploit that works on physical memory should also work with MTE enabled since its also a mitigation that only applies in virtual memoryFrom an attackers point of view I do think we might see a bit more of a trend to try to exploit components that deal with physical memory especially if MTE does end up becoming a mainstream kernel mitigation Also not having to adapt the exploit per each build is nice to haveLooking at recent research I found three other public Android exploits that deal with physical memoryFrom a defenders point of view the fact that I was able to exploit the kernel without encountering a single mitigation in the process is a bit concerning Especially since today the kernel is pretty full of mitigations Im also not sure that MTE would have made it any betterI guess one thing I should say from a defenders point of view is that if you havent already make sure to be extra sensitive and take extra care with any component that deals with physical memoryThe last thing Id like to say here is related to the interesting method of this exploit attacking the kernel by using the TrustZone The TrustZone is marketed as a security component and is supposed to make Android devices more secure Yet in this exploit it actually does the opposite as it created an avenue for me to attack the kernel that wouldnt have existed otherwise But I dont want this blog post to become a rant on how I believe software should be secured so

blog showcases the investigation Microsofts process in attributing the related actors and the observed tactics and techniques observed by DART and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center MSTIC to help customers and the security ecosystem defend from similar attacks in the futureMicrosoft assessed with high confidence that on July 15 2022 actors sponsored by the Iranian government conducted a destructive cyberattack against the Albanian government disrupting government websites and public services At the same time and in addition to the destructive cyberattack MSTIC assesses that a separate Iranian state-sponsored actor leaked sensitive information that had been exfiltrated months earlier Various websites and social media outlets were used to leak this informationThere were multiple stages identified in this campaignMicrosoft assessed with high confidence that multiple Iranian actors participated in this attackwith different actors responsible for distinct phasesMicrosoft uses DEV- designations as a temporary name given to an unknown emerging or a developing cluster of threat activity allowing MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity Once it meets the criteria the DEV reference is converted to a named actorMicrosoft assessed with moderate confidence that the actors involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data in the attack are linked to EUROPIUM which has been publicly linked to Irans Ministry of Intelligence and Security MOIS and was detected using three unique clusters of activity We track them separately based on unique sets of tools andor TTPs however some of them may work for the same unitInformation specific to Albania is shared with permission from the Albanian governmentEvidence gathered during the forensic response indicated that Iran-affiliated actors conducted the attack This evidence includes but is not limited toA group that we assess is affiliated with the Iranian government DEV-0861 likely gained access to the network of an Albanian government victim in May 2021 by exploiting the CVE-2019-0604 vulnerability on an unpatched SharePoint Server administrataal Collab-Web2 and fortified access by July 2021 using a misconfigured service account that was a member of the local administrative group Analysis of Exchange logs suggests that DEV-0861 later exfiltrated mail from the victims network between October 2021 and January 2022DEV-0861 was observed operating from the following IPs to exfiltrate mailAnalysis of the signals from these IPs and other sources indicated that DEV-0861 has been actively exfiltrating mail from different organizations in the following countries since April 2020The geographic profile of these victimsIsrael Jordan Kuwait Saudi Arabia Turkey and the UAEaligns with Iranian interests and have historically been targeted by Iranian state actors particularly MOIS-linked actorsThe code used in this attack had the following propertiesEmbedded in the clexe wiper was the hex-string B4B615C28CCD059CF8ED1ABF1C71FE03C0354522990AF63ADF3C911E2287A4B906D47D which was the same license key used for the EldoS RawDisk driver of the ZeroCleare wiper documented by IBM X-Force in 2019 The Eldos driver is a legitimate tool that was also abused by the ZeroCleare wiper and was used to delete files disks and partitions on the target systems While ZeroCleare is not widely used this tool is being shared amongst a smaller number of affiliated actors including actors in Iran with links to MOISThe ransomware payload used in this attack by the DEV-0842 operator had the following propertiesThis tool was signed with an invalid digital certificate from Kuwait Telecommunications Company KSC This certificate had a SHA-1 thumbprint of 55d90ec44b97b64b6dd4e3aee4d1585d6b14b26fMicrosoft telemetry indicates this certificate was only used to sign 15 other filesa very small footprint suggesting the certificate was not widely shared amongst unrelated actor groups Multiple other binaries with this same digital certificate were previously seen on files with links to Iran including a known DEV-0861 victim in Saudi Arabia in June 2021Its not clear if Readexe was dropped by DEV-0861 on this Saudi victim or if DEV-0861 also handed off access to the Saudi victim to DEV-0842The messaging linked to the attack closely mirrored the messaging used in cyberattacks against Iran a common tactic of Iranian foreign policy suggesting an intent to signal the attack as a form of retaliation The level of detail mirrored in the messaging also reduces the likelihood that the attack was a false flag operation by a country other than IranSome of the Albanian organizations targeted in the destructive attack were the equivalent organizations and government agencies in Iran that experienced prior cyberattacks with MEK-related messaging This suggests the Iranian government chose those targets to signal the cyberattacks as a form of direct and proportional retaliation a common tactic of the regimeBefore and after the Homeland Justice messaging campaign was launched social media persona accounts and a group of real-life Iranian and Albanian nationals known for their pro-Iran anti-MEK views promoted the campaigns general talking points and amplified the leaks published by the Homeland Justice accounts online The parallel promotion of the Homeland Justice campaign and its central themes by these entities in the online spacebefore and after the cyberattacksuggests a broad-based information operation aimed at amplifying the impact of the attackThe parallel promotion of the Homeland Justice campaign and its central themes by these individuals and personas online both before and after the cyberattack adds a compelling human dimension to the broader Homeland Justice influence effort While there were no observed direct relationships between the threat actors responsible for the destructive attack and these messaging actors their actions raise questions worthy of further examinationBased on investigative analysis starting in May 2021 actors exploited vulnerabilities of a public-facing endpoint to execute arbitrary code that implanted web shells on the unpatched SharePoint server Collab-Web2 as stated previously These generic web shells provided the ability to upload files download files delete files rename execute commands with an option to run as specific userWeb shells were placed in the following directoriesFollowing initial access and implant the threat actor was observed using Mimikatz for credential harvesting and a combination of Impacket and Remote Desktop Clients for lateral movement efforts using the built-in administrator account Unrecoverable tooling was identified which highly suggests that reconnaissance efforts were present in the form of file names of executables resident mailbox data database and user details Similar actions by the threat actors observed by MSTIC and DART detail both custom and open-source tooling utilized for these efforts Artifacts of tooling identifiedPrior to launching the final stage of the attack the threat actors gained administrative access to a deployed endpoint detection and response EDR solution to make modifications removinglibrariesthat affected the agents across the enterprise In addition a binary to disable components of Microsoft Defender Antivirus was propagated using custom tooling The distributed binary named disable-defenderexe queries for TokenElevation using the GetTokenInformation API and checks if the process is running with elevated privileges If the token is not running with elevated privilege the binary prints Must run as adminn If the token is elevated it queries TokenUser and checks if the SID is S-1-5-18 If the current process doesnt run under system context it prints Restarting with privilegesn and attempts to elevate the privilegeTo elevate the privilege the binary checks if the TrustedInstaller service is enabled To do this it starts the service SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege to assign privileges to itself It then looks for winlogonexe process acquires its token and impersonates calling thread using ImpersonateLoggedOnUserSetThreadToken After impersonating as winlogonexe it opens TrustedInstaller process acquires its token for impersonation and creates a new process with elevated privileges using CreateProcessWithTokenWOnce it successfully creates its own process with TrustedInstaller privilege it proceeds to disable Defender componentsAdditional evasion techniques included the deletion of tooling Windows events and application logsDistribution of the encryption and wiping binaries was accomplished with two methods via a custom SMB remote file copy tool Mellonaexe originally named MassExecuterexe The first method remote file copied the ransom binary GoXmlexe and a bat file that triggers the execution of the ransom or wiper on a user login The second method was by remotely invoking the ransom binary with the Mellonaexe tool post SMB remote file copywinbat

        "text": "DEV-0270 leverages exploits for high-severity vulnerabilities to gain access to devices and is known for the early adoption of newly disclosed vulnerabilities DEV-0270 also extensively uses living-off-the-land binaries LOLBINs throughout the attack chain for discovery and credential access This extends to its abuse of the built-in BitLocker tool to encrypt files on compromised devicesIn some instances where encryption was successful the time to ransom TTR between initial access and the ransom note was around two days The group has been observed demanding USD 8000 for decryption keys In addition the actor has been observed pursuing other avenues to generate income through their operations In one attack a victim organization refused to pay the ransom so the actor opted to post the stolen data from the organization for sale packaged in a SQL database dumpUsing these observations this blog details the groups tactics and techniques across its end-to-end attack chain to help defenders identify investigate and mitigate attacks We also provide extensive hunting queries designed to surface stealthy attacks This blog also includes protection and hardening guidance to help organizations increase resilience against these and similar attacksMicrosoft assesses that DEV-0270 is operated by a company that functions under two public aliases Secnerd secnerdir and Lifeweb lifewebir We have observed numerous infrastructure overlaps between DEV-0270 and SecnerdLifeweb These organizations are also linked to Najee Technology Hooshmand located in Karaj IranThe group is typically opportunistic in its targeting the actor scans the internet to find vulnerable servers and devices making organizations with vulnerable and discoverable servers and devices susceptible to these attacksAs with any observed nation state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts Microsoft uses DEV- designations as a temporary name given to an unknown emerging or a developing cluster of threat activity allowing Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity Once it meets the criteria a DEV is converted to a named actorOn the compromised Exchange server the actor used the following command to understand the target environmentFor discovery of domain controllers the actor used the following PowerShell and WMI commandDEV-0270 often opts for a particular method using a LOLBin to conduct their credential theft as this removes the need to drop common credential theft tools more likely to be detected and blocked by antivirus and endpoint detection and response EDR solutions This process starts by enabling WDigest in the registry which results in passwords stored in cleartext on the device and saves the actor time by not having to crack a password hashThe actor then uses rundll32exe and comsvcsdll with its built-in MiniDump function to dump passwords from LSASS into a dump file The command to accomplish this often specifies the output to save the passwords from LSASS The file name is also reversed to evade detections ssasldmpTo maintain access in a compromised network the DEV-0270 actor adds or creates a new user account frequently named DefaultAccount with a password of Pssw0rd1234 to the device using the command net user add The DefaultAccount account is typically a pre-existing account set up but not enabled on most Windows systemsThe attacker then modifies the registry to allow remote desktop RDP connections for the device adds a rule in the firewall using netshexe to allow RDP connections and adds the user to the remote desktop users groupScheduled tasks are one of the recurrent methods used by DEV-0270 in their attacks to maintain access to a device Generally the tasks load via an XML file and are configured to run on boot with the least privilege to launch a bat via the command prompt The batch file results in a download of a renamed dllhostexe a reverse proxy for maintaining control of the device even if the organization removes the file from the deviceDEV-0270 can usually obtain initial access with administrator or system-level privileges by injecting their web shell into a privileged process on a vulnerable web server When the group uses Impackets WMIExec to move to other systems on the network laterally they are typically already using a privileged account to run remote commands DEV-0270 also commonly dumps LSASS as mentioned in the credential access section to obtain local system credentials and masquerade as other local accounts which might have extended privilegesAnother form of privilege escalation used by DEV-0270 involves the creation or activation of a user account to provide it with administrator privileges DEV-0270 uses powershellexe and netexe commands to create or enable this account and add it to the administrators group for higher privilegesDEV-0270 uses a handful of defensive evasion techniques to avoid detection The threat actors typically turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus real-time protection to prevent Microsoft Defender Antivirus from blocking the execution of their custom binaries The threat group creates or activates the DefaultAccount account to add it to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups The modification of the DefaultAccount provides the threat actor group with a legitimate pre-existing account with nonstandard higher privileges DEV-0270 also uses powershellexe to load their custom root certificate to the local certificate database This custom certificate is spoofed to appear as a legitimate Microsoft-signed certificate However Windows flags the spoofed certificate as invalid due to the unverified certificate signing chain This certificate allows the group to encrypt their malicious communications to blend in with other legitimate traffic on the networkAdditionally DEV-0270 heavily uses native LOLBins to effectively avoid detection The threat group commonly uses native WMI net CMD and PowerShell commands and registry configurations to maintain stealth and operational security They also install and masquerade their custom binaries as legitimate processes to hide their presence Some of the legitimate processes they masquerade their tools as include dllhostexe taskupdateexe userexe and CacheTask Using bat files and powershellexe DEV-0270 might terminate existing legitimate processes run their binary with the same process name and then configure scheduled tasks to ensure the persistence of their custom binariesDEV-0270 has been seen creating defaultaccount and adding that account to the Remote Desktop Users group The group uses the RDP connection to move laterally copy tools to the target device and perform encryptionAn example of a command using Impackets WMIExec from a remote deviceDEV-0270 has been seen using setupbat commands to enable BitLocker encryption which leads to the hosts becoming inoperable For workstations the group uses DiskCryptor an open-source full disk encryption system for Windows that allows for the encryption of a devices entire hard drive The group drops DiskCryptor from an RDP session and when it is launched begins the encryption This method does require a reboot to install and another reboot to lock out access to the workstationThe following are DEV-0270s PowerShell commands using BitLockerMicrosoft will continue to monitor DEV-0270 and PHOSPHORUS activity and implement protections for our customers The current detections advanced detections and IOCs in place

services and more to support our mission to defend against cyber crimeGet the latest insights from cyber security experts at the frontlines of threat intelligence and incident responseLearn more about us and our mission to help organizations defend against cyber crimeToday Mandiant is releasing a comprehensive report detailing APT42 an Iranian state-sponsored cyber espionage group tasked with conducting information collection and surveillance operations against individuals and organizations of strategic interest to the Iranian government We estimate with moderate confidence that APT42 operates on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGCs Intelligence Organization IRGC-IO based on targeting patterns that align with the organizations operational mandates and prioritiesAPT42 uses highly targeted spear-phishing and social engineering techniques designed to build trust and rapport with their victims in order to access their personal or corporate email accounts or to install Android malware on their mobile devices In addition APT42 infrequently uses Windows malware to complement their credential harvesting and surveillance effortsAPT42 operations broadly fall into three categoriesMandiant has observed over 30 confirmed targeted APT42 operations spanning these categories since early 2015 The total number of APT42 intrusion operations is almost certainly much higher based on the groups high operational tempo visibility gaps caused in part by the groups targeting of personal email accounts and domestically focused efforts and extensive open-source industry reporting on threat clusters likely associated with APT42The targeting patterns for APT42 operations are similar to other Iranian cyber espionage actors with a large segment of its activity focused on the Middle East region However unlike other suspected IRGC-affiliated cyber espionage groups that have focused on targeting the defense industrial base or conducting large-scale collection of personally identifiable information PII APT42 primarily targets organizations and individuals deemed opponents or enemies of the regime specifically gaining access to their personal accounts and mobile devices The group has consistently targeted Western think tanks researchers journalists current Western government officials former Iranian government officials and the Iranian diaspora abroadSome APT42 activity indicates the group alters its operational focus as Irans priorities evolve to include targeted operations against the pharmaceutical sector at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and pursuing domestic and foreign-based opposition groups prior to an Iranian presidential election This indicates that APT42 is trusted by the Iranian government to quickly react to geopolitical changes by adjusting their flexible operations to targets of operational interest to TehranMandiant further highlights open-source reporting from Microsoft claiming a connection between intrusion activity clusters that generally align with APT42 and UNC2448 an Iran-nexus threat actor known for widespread scanning for various vulnerabilities the use of the Fast Reverse Proxy tool and reported ransomware activity using BitLocker Notably Mandiant has not observed technical overlaps between APT42 and UNC2448While Mandiant has not observed technical overlaps between APT42 and UNC2448 the latter may also have ties to the IRGC-IO We assess with moderate confidence that UNC2448 and the Revengers Telegram persona are operated by at least two Iranian front companies Najee Technology and Afkar System based on open-source information and operational security lapses by the threat actors Public leaking campaigns from the Lab Dookhtegan Telegram account further allege these companies are responsible for threat activity aligned with UNC2448 and operate on behalf of the IRGC-IOAPT42 activity poses a threat to foreign policy officials commentators and journalists particularly those in the United States the United Kingdom and Israel working on Iran-related projects Additionally the groups surveillance activity highlights the real-world risk to individual targets of APT42 operations which include Iranian dual-nationals former government officials and dissidents both inside Iran and those who previously left the country often out of fear for their personal safetyWe do not anticipate significant changes to APT42s operational tactics and mandate given the long history of activity and imperviousness to infrastructure take downs and a media spotlight on operational security failures Nevertheless the group has displayed its ability to rapidly alter its operational focus as Irans priorities change over time with evolving domestic and geopolitical conditions We assess with high confidence that APT42 will continue to perform cyber espionage and surveillance operations aligned with evolving Iranian operational intelligence collection

        "text": "Figure 1 Locations of targeted financial services employees all in French-speaking African countriesThe infection starts with spear-phishing emails written in French usually sent to several employees of the targeted companies all of which are medium to large financial groups in French-speaking Africa In the early stages of the campaign the phishing emails were sent using Gmail and Hotmail services To increase their credibility the actors began to use lookalike domains impersonating other financial institutions in Africa such as the Tunisian Foreign bank Nedbank and others For the last year the actors also used spoofed email addresses of a local insurance advisory company whose domain doesnt have an SPF recordFigure 2 An example of a phishing email in which the actors used the name of an existing employee at the impersonated companyFigure 3 Overview of the changes in the DangerousSavanna infection chains infrastructure and payloadsSince 2021 the actors have been attaching malicious documents to their phishing emails These documents are either Word documents with macros documents with a remote template or in some cases a few layers of external templates or PDF documents which lure the victim to download and then manually execute the next stage All these documents both MS Office or PDF are written in the French language and share similar metadata such as the usernames digger hooper davis and HooperDEVFigure 4 Overview of the lure documents used in the campaignThe basic flow utilizes Word documents with macros which drop an LNK file in the Startup folder When the LNK file is executed it downloads from the server and executes PowerShell commands which perform AMSI bypass and eventually install the PoshC2 implantFigure 5 Phishing document with macro infection flowThe macros contain a lot of unused code to complicate its analysis The code for the main functionality is trivial containing only reverse string obfuscation and caret obfuscation to create the LNK file used to retrieve the PoshC2 implantDuring this campaign we observed multiple variations of this flowIn addition the actors actively use PDF files to lure the user to download and manually execute the next stage These are VBE or JAR files that perform very similar actions directly loading the PoshC2 implant or dropping an LNK file to load PoshC2Recently the actors have relied mostly on PoshC2 implants to control the infected machines Typically after the initial infection launches PowerShell to download code from a Pastebin-like service called pastec-netorg or a dedicated CC server it replies with a PowerShell PoshC2 implant usually consisting of three byte-encoded blocks all standard modules from PoshC2 The first two PowerShell code blocks that are executed contain two very similar AMSI bypass techniquesThe third block contains a backdoor which is responsible for communication with the CC server It sends requests to the server in a loop with a cookie called SessionID with a base64-encoded AES encrypted string that contains information about the victimenvuserdomainuenvcomputernameenvPROCESSORARCHITECTUREpidprocname1The script expects the response by the CC to be a PowerShell script as well since it passes the result to the Invoke-Expression cmdletBack in October 2021 we observed a case where a malicious document from the campaign reached out to pastec-netorg but instead retrieved a PowerShell script that loads an AsyncRAT assembly in memory However this AsyncRAT build is completely unobfuscated and in fact contains a server certificate with the CN AsyncRAT Server showing the attackers gave little thought to making any changes to the open-source toolFigure 6 AsyncRAT Source Code on GitHub vs decompiled AsyncRAT on the rightThe earliest versions of the documents dated in the first half of 2021 have different macros which are significantly more obfuscated and contain more than a 1MB of junk codeFigure 8 Shellcode injection from WindowsFormsApp3exe 0b1d7c043be8c696d53d63fc0c834195 to mspaintexeSearching for more related files we found additional executables written in C that in a similar way launch a process such as notepadexe or mspaintexe and inject the shellcode to them not embedded but downloaded from a CC server into the benign process These simple injector executables vary little in their functionality The difference between them is the obfuscation methods some are packed with SmartAssembly and some contain obfuscated variable names However all of the shellcode payloads we observed are Meterpreter shellcode and of those executables that contain their debug information all reference the PDB path starting with CUserswallstreetFigure 9 Simplified infection chain for Nouvelles Reformes 2021pdfexe 7b8d0b4e718bc543de4a049e23672d79The second-stage executables purpose is to inject the final payload the Meterpreter shellcode which is usually downloaded from the hard-coded address to different benign Windows processes These tools are similar to those discussed by InQuest and unless their debugging information was removed also contain PDB paths with the unique username wallstreetIn late 2021 some of the infection chains started using C executables to perform even more simple actions simply launching PowerShell to pull the next stage from a server At the time the campaign was already using PoshC2 implants instead of Metasploit payloads but the tools still have PDB paths referring to wallstreet Example CUserswallstreetsourcereposPDF DocumentPDF DocumentobjReleasePDF DocumentpdbFigure 10 DLL from the attacker shellcode that patches AmsiScanBuffer and EtwEventWriteFigure 11 Event log showing the shellcode injection into RuntimeBrokerexeIt then loads the base64-encoded NET executable containing a base64-encoded PoshC2 PowerShell implant This chain of events eventually allows the actors to re-establish the backdoor in a stealthier manner running as a known Microsoft processTo set up persistence the actors drop a batch file called WinCompbat to the disk First it searches for the process iexpressexe the one that runs the injected shellcode If the process exists the script terminates Otherwise it starts the PowerShell backdoor using an obfuscated command and connects to a C2 server controlled by the attackersAdditionally the actors drop another script called slmgrvbs to the disk which simply executes WinCompbat To finish setting up persistence the actors create a scheduled task to run slmgrvbs every 5 minutes and two different scheduled tasks to execute WinCompbat every 6 hours After installing the scheduled tasks the actors add a hidden attribute on the script files to hide them from the user in the hope of avoiding detectionFinally the attackers attempt to create a memory dump of the svchostexe process most likely to extract from it the existing RDP credentialsDangerousSavanna targets medium or large finance-related enterprises which operate across multiple African countries The companies that belong to these financial groups provide a wide range of banking products and services and include not only banks but also insurance companies microfinancing companies financial holding companies financial management companies financial advisory services etc Despite the relatively low complexity of their tools we observed the signs that might point out that the attackers managed to infect some of their targets This was most likely due to the actors persistent attempts at infiltration If one infection chain didnt work out they changed the attachment and the lure and tried targeting the same company again and again trying to find an entry point With social engineering via spear-phishing all it takes is one incautious click by an unsuspecting userFigure 12 Overview of the changes in infection chains infrastructure and payloadsIn this article we analyzed a malicious email campaign targeting financial institutions in West and North Africa This campaign which has been running for almost two years often changes its tools and methods demonstrating the actors knowledge of open-source tools and penetration testing software We expect that this campaign which shows no signs of stopping or slowing down will continue to adjust its operations and methods with an eye to maximizing its financial gainSubscribe for cpr blogs news

        "title": "Pro-Russian Group Targeting Ukraine Supporters with DDoS Attacks - Avast Threat Labs",
        "text": "It has now been six months since the war in Ukraine began Since then pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian hacker groups like KillNet Anonymous IT Army of Ukraine Legion Spetsnaz RF have carried out cyberattacks A lesser-known group called NoName05716 is among the pro-Russian groups attacking Ukraine and the countries surrounding it and siding with UkraineNoName05716 is performing DDoS attacks on websites belonging to governments news agencies armies suppliers telecommunications companies transportation authorities financial institutions and more in Ukraine and neighboring countries supporting Ukraine like Ukraine itself Estonia Lithuania Norway and Poland A full list of the groups targets can be found at the end of this postTo carry out DDoS attacks hacker groups utilize botnets They control them via CC servers sending commands to individual bots which essentially act as soldiers Uncovering and tracking botnets is complex and time-consumingWe got our hands on malware called Bobik Bobik is not new its been around since 2020 and is known as a Remote Access Trojan Things have however recently changed Devices infected with Bobik are now part of a botnet and carrying out DDoS attacks for NoName05716 We can confidently attribute the attacks to the group as we have analyzed and compared what the CC server is instructing devices infected with Bobik to do with the attacks the group claims to be responsible for on their Telegram channelIn the wild one of the most monitored droppers for Bobik is RedLine Stealer a botnet-as-a-service cybercriminals can pay for to spread their malware of choice The usual workflow of Bobik is illustrated in the image belowAt first an unknown group seems to have purchased RedLine Stealer to deploy Bobik The final DDoS module deployment is composed of two basic stages The first executes Bobiks Updater via a RedLine Stealer bot In the second stage Bobiks Updater extracts and drops the final DDoS module Bobiks RuntimeBroker and ensures the modules persistenceWhen RuntimeBroker is run the module contacts a CC server and downloads a configuration file defining targets for DDoS attacks The module then starts the attacks using a defined count of threads usually five threadsThe detailed workflow of the Bobik deployment is shown below The RedLine Stealer Cryptic installer deobfuscates the NET payload of Bobiks Updater and injects it into the newly created process of the NET ClickOnce Launch Utility AppLaunchexe see steps 1 5The same process is used to execute Bobiks RuntimeBroker the DDoS module because the dropped RuntimeBroker is also packaged and obfuscated via RedLine Stealer Cryptic Therefore the dropped Bobiks RuntimeBroker also deobfuscates the NET payload of Bobiks RuntimeBroker and injects it into another AppLaunch process see steps 6 8 After all these steps the Bobiks DDoS module is deployed persistent and ready to attackSince June 1 2022 we have observed Bobiks network activities Bobik bots communicate with CC servers located in Russia and Romania These two servers are already offline However another Romanian server is still active and able to send commands to the botsThe last active server is 257122243 located in Romania and its first Bobiks activity we saw was on June 13 2022 We also have two DNS records for this malicious serverv9agm8uwtjmzsytesnet and q7zemy6zc7ptaeksservehttpcomThe second server 25712282 is also in Romania but the communication with the Bobik bots was deactivated around July 14 2022 The server is still active Nevertheless the server responds with a 502 HTTP code Bad Gateway Based on the findings from Server 1 this server used the same v9agm8uwtjmzsytesnet DNS record which was reconfigured to Server 1 in the middle of JuneThe first Bobiks CC server we saw was 7723241206 in Russia The server had opened ports 80 and 443 until June 9 2022 It is not usable and therefore de facto offline by Bobik bots because there is only one opened port for OpenSSH since Bobik requires port 80 for its CC communicationOne of the CC servers is a suspected development server at 109107181130 listening on port 5001 The server has been active since April and is located in Russia its reputation is also suspicious Avast has not detected any hits for this server in the wild However one Python sample uses the server as a testing environmentThe communication between Bobik bots and the CC servers is mediated using a simple unsecured HTTP request and response via the Nginx web server The bots obtain appropriate commands from the CCs utilizing a URL see the diagram belowThe request URL uses the following templatehttpiprequestupdateidsha256vversionprflagA body of the HTTP request contains one simple XML tag with information about the victim for instanceclient a01 a1en-US a2en-US a3140353 a4600 whereSee the examples of the notice URLsThe body of the HTTP response contains an encrypted and gzipped XML file configuring bots to the defined DDoS attacks See the example belowThe encrypted XML file has an elementary structure as shown belowMost of the XML attributes are intuitive so we will just explain the compound brackets in the path and body attributes The configuration often uses dynamically generated pieces definitions like this 1520 The definition dictates what long random text should be generated and in which positionThe definitions are abundantly applied in the path or body of the HTTP requests where the attackers expect an increased load on the server The effect is that bots flood servers with meaningless requests For instance the first task in the image directly above decrypted XML config uses this definition query1520 which means that the bots generate random texts of 15 20 characters long as requests to for example the calendar of Polands presidential office Similarly the second task flooded the reference system of bus lines in Ukraine with requests for a password reset as illustrated in this definition email51540gmailcomFor the most part we captured definitions sending data to login pages password recovery sites and site searches as can be seen from the XML config snippet belowConsequently the attackers try to overload a server with these requests as they are computationally intensive The requests require many accesses to server databases eg verifying emails for password resetting trying to login with random data definitions etcThe Avast telemetry data cannot paint a precise picture of the botnets size but we can estimate the approximate representation of Bobik in the wild see map below The map shows where according to Avasts telemetry the bots that attempt to carry out DDoS attacks for NoName05716 are located Avast has protected these devices from Bobik or from connecting to the CC server Most of the bots are located in Brazil India and Southeast AsiaAccording to our data the number of Bobik bots is a few hundred However the total number must be much larger considering the DDoS attacks acute effectiveness and frequency We therefore estimate there are thousands of Bobik bots in the wildWe estimated a procedure as to how the attackers determine which web servers to DDoS attack because we have configurations of unsuccessful attacksThe first step is looking for a target that supports Ukraine or a target with anti-Russian views The attackers analyze the structure of the targets website and identify pages that can cause server overloading especially requests requiring higher computing time such as searching password resetting login etcThe second step is filling in the XML template encrypting it and deploying it to the CC servers The attackers monitor the condition of the target server and modify the XML configuration based on needs modification of URL parameters bodies etc to be more effective The configuration is changed approximately three times per daySuppose the configuration is successful and a targeted server is in trouble In that case the configuration is fixed until the web server crashes or a server admins implement anti-DDoS technique or firewall rules based on GeoIPIf the attack is unsuccessful a new target is selected and the whole procedure of selection is repeatedIn the first phase the attackers targeted Ukrainian news servers they defined as being against the war in Ukraine Then the attacks targeted websites belonging to Ukrainian cities local governments distribution of electrical power Ukrainian companies supplying the Ukraine army with weapons railway bus companies and postal officesThe second phase targeted organizations publicly supporting Ukraine financially or materially like Ukraine banks and financial institutions and operators of local Ukraine gas reservoirs that publicly declared help for the defenders of UkraineOther attacks were more politically motivated based on government declarations of a given country Baltic states Lithuania Latvia and Estonia were the significant targets outside Ukraine of DDoS attacks carried out by the group Lets summarize targets outside of Ukraine chronologically since we started monitoring BobikThe graph below shows a timeline of Bobik DDoS attacks including successful and unsuccessful attacks from the beginning of June to mid-July 2022 captured by Avast telemetryFinally we inspected all hosts from the XML configuration files within our three-month observation period The pie chart below illustrates that sites from Lithuania and Poland are the main targets of the NoName05716 groupWe have tried identifying the hacker group controlling Bobik bots and CC servers It was evident that the group must be pro-Russia so we looked for the most famous DDoS attacksBobik initially attacked websites Killnet has marked as undesirable Killnet reports their DDoS attacks on their Telegram account At first it looked like the attacks carried out by Bobik distantly resembled Killnets activity because the timeline of attacked countries was similar to the XML configurations However many successful DDoS attacks by Bobik were not posted by KillnetOn June 21 2022 the Killnet group publicly thanked a group called NoName05716 for their support during a special military operationWhen we finished analyzing NoName05716s Telegram channel we confirmed that NoName05716 is responsible for the DDoS attacks performed by the Bobik bots All the XML configurations we captured from the NoName05716 CC servers exactly match the posts on the Telegram channelNoName05716 is a little-known pro-Russian hacker group They boast about their successful attack attempts on their Telegram channel which has more than 14K subscribers The group was active before we began tracking them on June 1 2022 Their Telegram channel was created on March 11 2022 We suspect they were either using a different set of botnets before June 1 2022 or updating the malware used to control the bots in JuneNoName05716 released a manifesto declaring cyberwar as an act of revenge for open information war against RussiaAs the group increased its activities and media profile it became easier to determine they were behind the attacks Therefore we can clearly state that Bobik is controlled by the pro-Russian hacker group called NoName05716The group only reports successful DDoS attacks on their Telegram channel Although the reported number of successful attacks seems large statistical information indicates the contraryThe group exclusively concentrates on DDoS attacks They do not try to steal data or gain access to systems like other dangerous groups The question is if they have the necessary knowledge strength and infrastructure to do more Carrying out DDoS attacks is straightforward and does not require deep technical knowledge Furthermore the Bobik implementation only sends a simple HTTP requestOur three-month observation shows that the groups attack success is around 40 We compared XML configurations captured by Avast to the achievements the group posts on their Telegram channel Moreover there is a particular set of targets making up 20 of their posts on Telegram NoName05716 claimed they successfully attacked but we did not match them to the targets listed in their configuration files For example NoName05716 claims to be responsible for attacking websites belonging to Lithuanian airports on June 25 2022However we did not find any records of the attack in the configuration files The likelihood of them not using all of their bots in attacks is slim In addition to this outage NoName05716 declared the sites were under a continuous fourteen-day attack This would require an extensive bot network especially considering the group performed other attacks during the same time frame and the websites were still offline From what we have seen it is unlikely that NoName05716 has an extensive bot network Moreover most of their DDoS attacks last a few hours maximally a few daysThe power of the DDoS attacks performed by NoName05716 is debatable to say the least At one time they can effectively strike about thirteen URL addresses at once judging by configuration history including subdomains Furthermore one XML configuration often includes a defined domaintarget as a set of subdomains so Bobik effectively attacks five different domains within one configuration Consequently they cannot focus on more domains for capacity and efficiency reasonsMost of the successful attacks result in servers being down for several hours or a few days To handle the attacks site operators often resort to blocking queries coming from outside of their country It is a typical and suitable solution for local serversdomains such as local ticket portals of local bustrain companies local institutionscompanies etc Therefore the DDoS impact on these domains has a minimal effect on the servers of local and smaller companies Some operators or owners of affected servers have unregistered their domains but these are extreme casesThe DDoS attacks carried out were more difficult to handle for some site operators of prominent and significant domains such as banks governments and international companies After a successful attack we noticed larger companies implementing enterprise solutions like Cloudflare or BitNinja which can filter incoming traffic and detect DDoS attacks in most cases On the other hand most large international companies expect heavier traffic and run their web servers in the Cloud with anti-DDoS solutions making them more resilient to attacks For example the group was unsuccessful in taking down sites belonging to Danish bank Danske Bank attacked June 19 21 2022 and Lithuanian bank SEB attacked July 12 13 2022 and July 20 21 2022The success of DDoS attacks depends on victim selection The more successful attacks affected companies with simple sites including about us our mission and a contact page for example These types of companies do not use their web pages as the main part of their business These servers are therefore not typically designed to be heavily loaded and do not implement anti-DDoS techniques making them a very easy targetThe groups DDoS attack on Pozna-awica Airport in Poland took the site offline for 16 minutes NoName05716 configured Bobik bots based on the tasks shown in the screenshot belowOn June 23 2022 NoName05716 reported on Telegram that Lithuanian authorities lifted a ban on the transit of Russian cargo to Kaliningrad The group attributes the lifting of the ban amongst other things to the efforts of their cyber attacks on Lithuanias infrastructure which is debatable at best However the attacks on Lithuanian servers have continuedThe botnet went into an idle state on September 1 2022 at 6 PM UTC and remained idle persisted for 12 hours The botnet was reactivated on September 2 2022 at 4 AM UTC The XML file sent to the bots contained empty tasks like in this example configtasks delay0 threadcount-6configA decline in the botnets performance may be a possible explanation for this The group only posted two general posts to their Telegram channel on September 1 and 2 2022 instead of boasting about successful attacks our first indication the botnet might not be performing wellThe first post was about the beginning of the new school year and day of knowledge The group also mentioned being on the defense of the cyber front for their country and the for the safety of the younger generation The second post was about information guns and DDoS tanks that worked quietly on very difficult and important workIn fact NoName05716 changed targets ten times each day in the XML configurations which is abnormal We monitored the targets for these days and none of the attacks were successful Therefore it is evident that the botnet had some troubleMost of the sites attacked by the group have implemented anti-DDoS protections This slowdown implies that the botnet is relatively static without many changes such as recruiting new bots or dynamically changing bots IPs A static botnet is an advantage for anti-DDoS protections because malicious traffic can be easily identifiedNoName05716 has continued to attack other easier targets since September Only the future will reveal the Bobik botnets successes and failures However the attacks success rate has been only around 25 since the beginning of SeptemberWe investigated and analyzed malware used to carry out DDoS attacks on sites in and around Ukraine starting in June 2022 We identified the malware as a NET variant of a RAT called Bobik including a DDoS module and spreading via a bot-net-as-a-service RedLine StealerThe first technical part of this investigation uncovered CC servers and the HTTP communication protocol used by the Bobik bots We also successfully decrypted the HTTP protocol including its parameters This allowed us to monitor the CC servers and collect information about the botnet architecture and XML configurations defining the DDoS targetsThe second aim was to determine the bad actors behind the attacks We identified a pro-Russian hacker group called NoName05716 as the users or possibly even the authors of Bobik based on the XML configurations and what the group posts to their Telegram channelNoName05716 focuses exclusively on DDoS attacks and looks for companies and organizations that support Ukraine or are anti-Russian They do not try to steal data or gain access to the system like other dangerous groups Therefore we can declare that their activities are only harmful in the sense that they can lose companies business while their sites are offline but attacked sites that have gone offline have luckily recovered quickly Their activities are more annoying than dangerousWe found that the successful attacks defined by NoName05716 make up just 40 of all of their attack attempts The success of their attacks depends on the quality of the targeted infrastructure The evidence suggests that well-secured and designed servers can withstand the groups DDoS attacksThe group focuses on serversdomains as retaliation for cyber-attacks and sanctions on Russia All successful attacks and even successful attacks the group is not responsible for but claims to be are posted to their Telegram channelhttpiprequestupdateidsha256vversionprflagStunning 50 Surge in Blocked Attacks Resulting in 1 Billion Monthly BlocksTechnical

it sniffs their traffic as it passes through the proxy This way they can harvest valid session cookies and bypass the need to authenticate with usernames passwords andor 2FA tokens Resecurity has acquired videos released by EvilProxy actors demonstrating how it can be used to steal the victims session and successfully go through Microsoft2FA and Google e-mail services to gain access to the target accountEvilProxy is offered on a subscription base when the end user a cybercriminal chooses a service of interest to target eg Facebook or Linkedin the activation will be for a specific period of time 10 20 or 31 days as per the plans description which was published by the actors on multiple Dark Web forums One of the key actors -

demonetize ads it places by removing them from specific problematic articles as opposed to cutting off whole sitesGoogle has long been under fire for how its advertising practices fuel Russian propaganda A day after Russias February invasion of Ukraine Warner sent the company a letter encouraging it to at a minimum audit Google and Google sister brand YouTubes advertising practices including its compliance with sanctions It is unacceptable for Google to keep placing ads on Russian websites that funnel money to Russian companies months after it pledged to stop Google is either flouting its promises or it doesnt even know where it is selling adsAsked on Thursday about the latest example of Google ads appearing on Russian-backed disinformation sites Aciman told CyberScoop in a prepared statement that Google employees had reviewed the sites in question and have taken appropriate enforcement actions Acimans statement said that after Russias invasion of Ukraine Google also stopped the monetization of Russian state-funded media across our platforms Since then our teams have continued to monitor our network for additional state-funded actors and have demonetized them when detectedAciman added that Google has updated its advertising and monetization policies in response to the war in UkraineShortly after the war started we stopped monetization on Russian state-funded media across our platforms including YouTube he said This was not a singular action and weve continued to demonetize state-funded media as weve detected itOur ad should not have appeared on this website it clearly doesnt align with who we are as a company Mark Molzan Global Issues Director for the telecom company Lumen which owns CenturyLink told CyberScoop We have proactively turned off all the campaigns within Google Display until we can gain confidence the safeguards we have in place to prevent this type of placement are working as intendedGoogle did not say which of the sites running ads Vickers posted had been removed from its network but confirmed those removed were determined to be state-owned Examples of the advertising Vickers posted from across the Russian sites made clear that state-owned or not many of the Google-served ads appear next to propaganda Zelenskys plans to resign revealed said a headline appearing on one of the websites next to a large Adidas ad Another headline appearing below a CenturyLink ad said West in shock Russia has confirmed its status as a great powerDisinformation activists and digital advertising experts questioned why a company as powerful and well-resourced as Google continues to struggle to manage a problem that an individual software engineer detected and posted on Twitter Propaganda needs three things to thrive legitimacy money and data said Claire Atkin co-founder of Check My Ads Institute an independent watchdog It gets everything it needs from Googles ad exchange If Google cared about national security theyd stop handing Russia the most powerful propaganda weapon to use against usWhile most brands dont want to send their money or credibility to these sites by continuing to monetize them Google makes it hard to avoid Vickers saidThe full list of brands Adalytics found on sanctioned Russian sites in April included Adidas Citibank CVS Facebook and Google itself among many others according to Adalytics CEO Krzysztof FranaszekTheres been several incidents where journalists have notified Google of potentially illegal activities on Googles ad network Franaszek said In each case Googles spokesperson gives a response such as We have strict policies or If we find a site or partner violates our policies we take immediate action' He said in each case the websites or ad tech platforms explicitly mentioned by the journalist in their request for comment to Google appear to be removed within a few days of contact However after each of these incidents he said researchers have noted that other similar cases not explicitly mentioned were not removed from Googles ad network even months or years later"
