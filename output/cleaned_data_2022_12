        "text": "SNI proxies are load balancers that use the SNI extension field to select backend systems When misconfigured SNI proxies can be vulnerable to SSRF attacks that provide access to web application backendsA typical task in complex web applications is routing requests to different backend servers to perform load balancing Most often a reverse proxy is used for this Such reverse proxies work at the application level over HTTP and requests are routed based on the value of the Host header authority for HTTP2 or parts of the pathServer Name Indication SNI is an extension of the TLS protocol that provides the foundation of HTTPS When a browser wants to establish a secure connection to a server it initiates a TLS handshake by sending a ClientHello message This message may contain an SNI extension field that includes the server domain name In its ServerHello message the server can then return a certificate appropriate for the specified server name The typical use case for this is when there are multiple virtual hosts behind one IP addressWhen a reverse proxy more correctly a load balancer uses a value from the SNI field to select a specific backend server we have an SNI proxy With the widespread use of TLS and HTTPS in particular this approach is becoming more popular Note that another meaning of SNI proxy refers to the use of such proxies to bypass censorship in some countriesThere are two main options for running an SNI proxy with or without SSL termination In both cases the SNI proxy uses the SNI field value to select an appropriate backend When running with SSL termination the TLS connection is established with the SNI proxy and then the proxy forwards the decrypted traffic to the backend In the second case the SNI proxy forwards the entire data stream really working more like a TCP proxyTo give an example for Nginx the simplest configuration would look as follows note that this requires the Nginx modules ngxstreamcoremodule and ngxstreamsslprereadmodule to workHere we configure a server TCP proxy called stream and enable SNI access using sslpreread on Depending on the SNI field value in sslprereadservername Nginx will route the whole TLS connection either to backend1 or backend2The simplest misconfiguration that would allow you to connect to an arbitrary backend would look something like thisHere the SNI field value is used directly as the address of the backendWith this insecure configuration we can exploit the SSRF vulnerability simply by specifying the desired IP or domain name in the SNI field For example the following command would force Nginx to connect to internalhostcomAnother class of vulnerable configurations is similar to typical HTTP reverse proxy misconfigurations and involves mistakes in the regular expression regex In this example traffic is forwarded to the backend if the name provided via SNI matches the regexThis regex is incorrect because the first period character in wwwexamplecom is not escaped and the expression is missing the terminator at the end The resulting regex matches not only wwwexamplecom but also URLs like wwwexamplecomattackercom or wwwAexamplecom As a result we can perform SSRF and connect to an arbitrary backend While we cant use the IP address directly here we can bypass this restriction simply by telling our DNS server that wwwexamplecomattackercom should resolve to 127001Whenever you configure a reverse proxy you should be aware that any misconfigurations may potentially lead to SSRF vulnerabilities that expose backend systems to attack The same applies to SNI proxies especially as they are gaining popularity in large-scale production systems In general to avoid vulnerabilities when configuring a reverse proxy you should understand what data could be controlled by an attacker and avoid using it directly in an insecure wayAleksei is a security researcher and pentester with broad experience in offensive security He is also an active member of the global security community participating in events and giving lecturesInvicti Security Corp 1000 N Lamar Blvd Suite 300 Austin TX 78703 US Invicti 2023"

        "text": "The headquarters building of the US Department of Health and Human Services is the Hubert H Humphrey Building located at the foot of Capitol Hill Photo credit Library of CongressHC3 has been closely tracking hacktivist groups given their broad global targeting across a range of sectors including healthcare These groups are known to launch DDoS attacks with thousands of connection requests and packets to be sent to the target server or website per minute slowing down or even stopping vulnerable systemsKillNet is one of these hacktivist groups with unconfirmed ties to official Russian government organizations like the Russian Federal Security Service FSB or the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service SVR The group previously targeted primarily European countries perceived to be hostile to RussiaBut the war in Ukraine has shifted those tactics to include countries that are part of NATO While KillNets DDoS attacks usually do not cause major damage they can cause service outages lasting several hours or even days according to the alert The group should be considered a threat to government and critical infrastructure organizations including healthcareParticularly as the group recently targeted a US organization in the healthcare sectorKillNet has previously targeted or threatened to target healthcare and public health organizations The HC3 alert stressed that a senior member of the group previously threatened Congress with the sale of the health and personal data of the American people because of the Ukraine policy of the US CongressJust this month the group claimed to have compromised a US-based healthcare organizationthat supports members of the US military and claimed to possess a large amount of user data from that organization according to the alertAnd after the arrest of a KillNet member earlier this year the group demanded his release and threatened to target life-saving ventilators in British hospitals if their demands were not metThe same member also threatened to target the UK Ministry of HealthBut its worth taking any claims KillNet makes about its attacks or operations with a grain of salt given the groups tendency to exaggerate Its possible some of these announced operations and developments may only be to garner attention both publicly and across the cybercrime underground according to the alertHC3 also noted that its likely the groups senior members have extensive experience with deploying DDoS attacks but KillNet has been using publicly available DDoS scripts and IP stressors for most of its operations And federal efforts have shut down dozens of internet domains tied to leading DDoS-for-hire services while taking other enforcement actionsBut despite successful efforts its unknown how much the law enforcement actions will impact KillNet Its also possible that pro-Russian ransomware groups or operators such as those from the defunct Conti group will heed KillNets call and provide supportThis likely will result in entities KillNet targeted also being hit with ransomware or DDoS attacks as a means of extortion a tactic several ransomware groups have used HC3 warnedWhile its not possible to completely eliminate the risk of a DDoS attack providers should take note of the recommended measures for preparing to respond to a possible attack This should include prioritizing services understanding defense measures upstream defenses and having a well-practiced response planThe alert contains links to Killnet insights as well as recommended DDoS measures provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security AgencyIncreased vigilance is especially important currently as foreign cyber gangs and spies continue to test our resiliency through use of remote access tools exploitation of technical vulnerabilities and use of new ransomware strains all in an attempt to steal patient data and disrupt health care delivery Riggi said in a statementRiggi stressed that

kind in Mexico's history included details about the president's health as well as communication between some of the country's top military officialsAround the same time similar troves were being leaked from police and military organizations throughout Latin America including El Salvadors National Police and Armed Forces the General Command of the Armed Forces in Colombia the Peruvian Army and Chiles General Staff of National DefenseBut what three months after their release has the impact of the leaks actually been On this cybersecurity experts across Latin America are mixedThe ramifications have been specific to the country and to how each nations press has handled the documentsNone of the governments involved responded to repeated requests for commentSeveral experts noted that the official silence on much of what was leaked was typical of governments across Latin America but highlighted precisely why the hacks were so important CyberPeace Institute CEO Stphane Duguin explained that the hacks shed light on a range of illegal activities that otherwise would not have been knownDilmar Villena executive director of rights group Hiper Derecho told The Record that the leaks did not shock the region uniformly with each country perceiving them differentlyIt is worth highlighting what happened in Chile and Mexico due to the political repercussions they had However it cannot be said that Latin American public opinion has unanimously paid attention to Guacamaya hacks he saidThe response that the governments gave has to do with the level of attention that public opinion has given to it In some cases there were changes of ministers and high command of the army however in other countries such as the Peruvian case there was no great response or institutional changes about itMuch of it comes down to the importance each countrys national press gave the leaks Villena explained noting that if the local press did not take an interest in the leaks it did not end up stirring public debateThe documents revealed that Perus army was monitoring several human rights groups including Amnesty International IDL Derechos Humanos sin Fronteras and CooperAccinThe largest tranche of documents six terabytes in total came from servers run by Mexicos army and there has been a slow trickle of news from the leaked documentsThe stolen emails and files reveal the armys growing control of the countrys institutions as well as plans for the militarys involvement in several economic and infrastructure projects across the country something Guacamaya told The Record it was intent on revealingThe leaks concerning Mexico revealed that the army also has plans for other infrastructure projects in the region and has interest in creating its own airlineWe decided to share the stolen documents with any that we can verify are reputable journalists whether we agree with their politics and like their reporting or not the group told The RecordAnd unfortunately those doing serious investigations take time while those reporting tabloid gossip on the health of the president are fast to publishMaria Paz Canales a lawyer in Chile and executive director of the nonprofit Derechos Digitales said the revelations from the Guacamaya leaks have also given momentum to discussions about the cybersecurity shortcomings of Latin American institutions and their militariesThey relied a lot on the fact that because they are powerful institutions inside their own countries that they are in some way beyond the actions of other groups that can access to their systems and information she said At the same time there is a huge deficit in terms of the knowledge and sophistication that they have for protecting their own systemsDozens of government agencies across Latin America have faced ransomware attacks and cybersecurity incidents throughout 2022 highlighting the need for institutions to better protect citizen dataCanales explained she was recently invited to a hearing held by Mexicos Senate on cybersecurity and similar discussions are being held in Chiles legislature about the need for some kind of cybersecurity legislationIt's really embarrassing that they are failing in very basic things In this case one person failed to fulfill the basic duty of updating software or ensuring to patch software Canales saidVillena asserted that the hacks were evidence that cybersecurity is not taken seriously in the region This was clear according to Villena by how small the military budgets were when it comes to cybersecurityShortcomings and deficiencies in cybersecurity are a common denominator in the countries of the region Villena told The Record But he warned that little would change until there was a cyberattack that put critical assets at riskI am not very optimistic on this point What I think should happen is a real investigation and conversation with the people responsible for cybersecurity policies about designing public policies that comprehensively address this problem he saidThis would include sanctioning the high command of the armed forces and carrying out regular inspections at the very least However again I am not very optimistic that all this will come to passOne of the standout themes from the leaks were revelations about military use of spyware against journalists and human rights defendersIn this case we already had a lot of evidence of the army's participation a situation that was confirmed days before publication thanks to the Guacamaya leaks It has also shown how the military intelligence catalogs social and dissident groups as subjects of interest and equates them with criminal and terrorist groups Maldonado saidPegasus was allegedly used against two journalists and one human rights defender in Mexico according to Article 19 Vladimir Corts Roshdestvensky digital rights programme officer at the organization said the leaks revealed contracts signed between the Mexican Army and NSO GroupElectronic Frontier Foundations Alimonti added that the leaks raised the issue of government surveillance to the public and highlighted the lack of human rights standards around the use of spywareShe noted that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also raised concerns about the spyware revelations in OctoberThe acts of illegal surveillance have an intimidating effect and send a negative signal of government intolerance to criticism contrary to the free and safe environment that must be guaranteed for the exercise of the right to defend human rights and freedom of the press Fernndez-Maldonado saidAlimonti said the revelations about military surveillance were important for efforts among civil rights organizations like hers to create human rights safeguards and standards with regard to how spyware is deployed across the regionThe tools are currently being used abusively and arbitrarily she said highlighting the need for institutional public oversightAlimonti said the government was effectively working against itself attempting to provide more device security for citizens while also hiring companies that specialize in exploiting those same devicesIt is another paradox you have states that are claiming left and right that the internet needs to be secure be a safe space to trust but they're spending public money and giving it to companies that make sure that the old constructs of the internet are full of holes and vulnerabilities Duguin saidIn Mexico especially the leaks have spurred conversations about the countrys growing militarization and the armys ever larger role in civilian lifeBut army officials in Mexico have sought to downplay the significance of the leaks criticizing news outlets for publishing information while failing toaddress the content of the storiesIt's part of the strategy of the Mexican Government said Corts Roshdestvensky the digital rights programme officer at Article 19 Theyre attacking those who reveal certain information of public interest by stigmatizing their work as journalists or their work as human rights defendersMaldonado Article 19s regional director said some government officials in El Salvador and Mexico have claimed the hacks are part of a campaign by opposition parties against themWhile the leaks have prompted Mexicos Congress to draft tough cybersecurity measures he said the rules are more like cyber-patrolling and censorship of the InternetWhile interest in the hacks has waned in recent weeks there were intensive discussions and debate about cybersecurity in the first weeks after the leaksI believe were going to continue seeing those debates around access to information around militarization in Mexico around the cybersecurity debate and more he saidMaldonado hoped that the leaked information would lead to accountability processes but explained that the Mexican government has already dismissed any such measureThere needs to be some level of accountability and transparency Roshdestvensky explained noting that the monitoring of opposition parties by multiple governments showed that this conduct must be regulated by civiliansThere is no information on where the Guacamaya group which takes its name from the Mayan word for macaw is basedBut in conversations with The Record the group communicated mostly in Spanish and spoke passionately of launching the hacking campaign to expose the environmental degradation and human rights abuses of militaries across Latin AmericaThe group told The Record that their work is a continuation of the struggle and resistance of the people of Abya Yala and explained that the leaks are a form of fightingTheir ultimate goal is to reveal what we all already know in a way that is more palpable and documented lauding the news outlets and human rights organizations that have fearlessly covered the corruption and abuses revealed in the documentsThe oppressed peoples as well as mother earth have a weariness in the face of how the capitalist system has devastated life putting capital and production above all else We want a return to life to the good life that only occurs in harmony with others a representative for the group saidThe stolen files showed reprehensible conduct from the militaries and police forces in the region as well as the widespread criminal repression that people face from extractive and pyramidal organizationsThe group said its hope was a future where the global north abandons the looting and extractivism of natural resources and stops violating Mother EarthThere is very little of the jungle left and when the rivers dry up when our people are being poisoned we can only be on the side of life and our hope is to continue acting resisting like our ancestors they said calling their effort a popular movementGuacamaya said the response to the leaks was evidence that most governments will not put themselves on trial and address the issues that people have concerns aboutWhen asked what they hoped would come from their actions the group said they believed only the people save the people and called for others to take similar action against what they allege are corrupt governmentsThese actions also are an invitation to use this tool hacking and make it functional to the legacy left by our ancestors so that as oppressed peoples we can launch rebellion and resistance against oppressionJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014 Before moving back to New York City he worked for

operations are a constantly evolving threat to devices and networks Threat actors target Internet of Things IoT devices for recruitment into malicious operations as IoT devices configurations often leave them exposed and the number of internet-connected devices continue to grow Recent trends have shown that operators are redeploying malware for a variety of distributions and objectives modifying existing botnets to scale operations and add as many devices as possible to their infrastructureZerobot affects a variety of devices that include firewall devices routers and cameras adding compromised devices to a distributed denial of service DDoS botnet Using several modules the malware can infect vulnerable devices built on diverse architectures and operating systems find additional devices to infect achieve persistence and attack a range of protocols Microsoft tracks this activity as DEV-1061April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather DEV-1061 is now tracked as Storm-1061 The most recent distribution of Zerobot includes additional capabilities such as exploiting vulnerabilities in Apache and Apache Spark CVE-2021-42013 and CVE-2022-33891 respectively and new DDoS attack capabilitiesIoT devices are often internet-exposed leaving unpatched and improperly secured devices vulnerable to exploitation by threat actors Zerobot is capable of propagating through brute force attacks on vulnerable devices with insecure configurations that use default or weak credentials The malware may attempt to gain device access by using a combination of eight common usernames and 130 passwords for IoT devices over SSH and telnet on ports 23 and 2323 to spread to devices Microsoft researchers identified numerous SSH and telnet connection attempts on default ports 22 and 23 as well as attempts to open ports and connect to them by port-knocking on ports 80 8080 8888 and 2323In addition to brute force attempts on devices Zerobot exploits dozens of vulnerabilities which malware operators add on a rolling basis to gain access and inject malicious payloads Zerobot 11 includes several new vulnerabilities such asSince the release of Zerobot 11 the malware operators have removed CVE-2018-12613 a phpMyAdmin vulnerability that could allow threat actors to view or execute files Microsoft researchers have also identified that previous reports have used the vulnerability ID ZERO-32906 for CVE-2018-20057 GPON for CVE-2018-10561 and DLINK for CVE-2016-20017 and that CVE-2020-7209 was mislabeled as CVE-2017-17106 and CVE-2022-42013 was mislabeled as CVE-2021-42013Microsoft researchers have also found new evidence that Zerobot propagates by compromising devices with known vulnerabilities that are not included in the malware binary such as CVE-2022-30023 a command injection vulnerability in Tenda GPON AC1200 routersUpon gaining device access Zerobot injects a malicious payload which may be a generic script called zerosh that downloads and attempts to execute Zerobot or a script that downloads the Zerobot binary of a specific architecture The bash script that attempts to download different Zerobot binaries tries to identify the architecture by brute-force attempting to download and execute binaries of various architectures until it succeeds as IoT devices are based on many computer processing units CPUs Microsoft has observed scripts targeting various architectures including ARM64 MIPS and x8664Depending on the operating system of the device the malware has different persistence mechanisms Persistence tactics are used by malware operators to obtain and maintain access to devices While Zerobot is unable to spread to Windows machines we have found several samples that can run on Windows On Windows machines the malware copies itself to the Startup folder with the file name FireWallexe older versions use myexe Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects this malware and related malicious activity on both Windows and Linux devices See detection details belowTo achieve persistence on Linux-based devices Zerobot uses a combination of desktop entry daemon and service methodsDesktop entryZerobot copies itself to HOMEconfigsshservicesshf then writes a desktop entry file called sshfdesktop to the same directory Older Linux versions use HOMEconfigautostart instead of HOMEconfigsshserviceDaemonCopies itself to usrbinsshf and writes a configuration at etcinitsshfconfServiceCopies itself to etcsshf and writes a service configuration at libsystemsystemsshfservice then enables the service to make sure it starts at boot with two commandsAll persistence mechanisms on older Linux versions use mybin and mybindesktop instead of sshf and sshfdesktopIn addition to the functions and attacks included in previous versions of the malware Zerobot 11 has additional DDoS attack capabilities These functions allow threat actors to target resources and make them inaccessible Successful DDoS attacks may be used by threat actors to extort ransom payments distract from other malicious activities or disrupt operations In almost every attack the destination port is customizable and threat actors who purchase the malware can modify the attack according to their targetThe following are the previously known Zerobot capabilitiesPreviously undisclosed and new capabilities are the followingAfter persistence is achieved Zerobot scans for other internet-exposed devices to infect The malware randomly generates a number between 0 and 255 and scans all IPs starting with this value Using a function called newbotnetselfRepoisHoneypot the malware tries to identify honeypot IP addresses which are used by network decoys to attract cyberattacks and collect information on threats and attempts to access resources This function includes 61 IP subnets preventing scanning of these IPsMicrosoft researchers also identified a sample that can run on Windows based on a cross-platform Linux Windows macOS open-source remote administration tool RAT with various features such as managing processes file operations screenshotting and running commands This tool was found by investigating the command-and-control C2 IPs used by the malware The script which is used to download this RAT is called impstshThe continuous evolution and rapid addition of new capabilities in the latest Zerobot version underscores the urgency of implementing comprehensive security measures Microsoft recommends the following steps to protect devices and networks against the threat of ZerobotMicrosoft Defender for IoTMicrosoft Defender for IoT uses detection rules and signatures to identify malicious behavior Microsoft

        "text": "Solutions forStealing data from an isolated network by manipulating the voltage switching converterDecember 21 2022This time Guri explored the possibility of applying the operating principle of voltage switching to exfiltrate data Any power supply for a phone or laptop is basically an AC-to-DC switching converter Switch-mode power supplies are more compact than linear ones but by their very nature emit a good deal of radio interference Most of all they irritate radio amateurs operating on medium and short waves where the parasitic radiation of such power supplies is especially noticeableSimilar voltage converters are present in many personal computers some of which are used to power the CPU All modern CPUs use a system of dynamic voltage and frequency variation Such a system makes it possible to reduce power consumption when the CPU is idle you can lower its frequency and voltage then raise them sharply when a new computational task comes alongSince in the studied scenario the attacker already controls the victims computer with malware they are able to manipulate the CPU load in some way and with it the frequency and voltage But how Guri found that the parasitic radiation of a switching voltage converter changes form when the operating voltage is altered And the voltage varies depending on the load That is by applying a load to the CPU at a specific interval you can generate a radio signal at a certain frequencyThe signal transmission frequency can be set by alternately loading and unloading the CPU at this specific interval thousands of times per second The type of load that is what the CPU is asked to compute does not matter it is run for no other reason than to generate a radio signal of a certain shape The CPU under load requires a change in the supply voltage the voltage converter creates radio interference and the conductors on the motherboard act as an antenna Heres what the resulting radio signal looks likeGuri also discusses in detail the issue of reception A low-power radio signal can in reality be received at a distance of no more than 2 meters from an isolated systemThe figure shows one of the possible scenarios an attacker visits the victims office and extracts secret information from an infected machine The data exfiltration can also be performed by a bribed employee of the target organization In either case it is unlikely that the attackers will be able to carry bulky radio gear with them which is why the study highlights a method for receiving classified information via smartphoneMost smartphones are not equipped with a medium-wave radio receiver but its possible to make do with an audio chip An analog-to-digital converter in the smartphone is capable of digitizing radio waves with a frequency of up to 24 kilohertz so one has to insert an antenna into the headset jack It might not be ideal but as practice shows it gets the job doneThe resulted data exfiltration technique is fairly effective by the standards of attacks on protected isolated systems of course Besides the slow form of data theft shown above Guri also tested out faster transmission methods some of which hit speeds of up to 1000 bps This is enough to transfer an IP address in an instant an encryption key in 4 seconds and small files in minutesThe study dutifully lists potential ways to counteract this method of exfiltration The simplest is that same social distancing not letting outsiders nearer than 2 meters to protected computers And then there are some slightly more complex ones you can for example stifle the data transfer by loading the CPU with your own tasks This wastes energy but reliably prevents leakage Interestingly locking the CPU on a particular frequency despite reducing the signal power does not rule out data transmission The varying load on the CPU produces interference that can still help a spy even at a constant frequencyMany hacks have started during Christmas

        "text": "The healthcare sector has long been warned theyre not keeping pace with evolving threats creating an untenable situation resulting in serious impacts New insights from Hold Security shows Clop ransomware actors are upping the ante targeting the trusted relationships between providers and patients to deliver their payloadThe risk to healthcare is greater than before Hold Security Founder Alex Holden warns that the message is simple all medical professionals need to get better because the bad guys are stepping up We need to speed up To get a sense of these new tactics and the possible impacts on providers SC Media spoke with Hold Security Founder Alex Holden and found the outlook looks relatively bleak The group is using highly original tactics to better understand workflows within medical systems to hide their attacks for a greater impactClop is known to target medical facilities that meet a revenue of more than 10 million and other facilities with more than 5 million a year Holden notes that among these targets are groups of dentists doctors offices or other smaller providers that operate as part of bigger healthcare systemsThe second component is that theyve learned the nuances of the healthcare system workflows and how certain processes work for various healthcare issues particularly around telemedicine and other remote care platforms Before COVID-19 Holden believes these tactics would not be finding as much successBut with the rapid expansion of telemedicine and its evolution as a standard of care for many particularly in rural areas Clop is finding it easier to exploit these targeted workflowsOn the whole there are huge vulnerabilities in the ways medical records are being stored from gaps in the in-house security or how some medical professionals present their profiles on corporate or medical sites The trouble with these new tactics is that Clop isnt doing anything innovative process-wiseIf they understand the process if they understand all these intricacies of our process they can insert themselves into the areas where we would expect them less or with weakened defenses when a doctor has a primary duty to the patient and not cybersecurity said HoldenDoctors don't think about cybersecurity when they are operating he continuedPractitioners might not even think about cybersecurity when looking at patient data Holden said so if a doctor receives an email not from a patient but from different doctors its likely they wont consider whether something isnt right about the emailIn short Clop is preying on trusted relationships to build a backdoor for their nefarious activities Holden has even seen CD-ROMs and image files infected with malwareIn one example a cardiovascular issue discussed remotely would require certain tests that might not be possible over the phone The doctor may refer the individual to another system which requires medical insurance information Holden explained that Clop actors are procuring medical records for this particular purpose rather than just shifting the data into their handsTheyre basically registered as the patient themselves said Holden They are taking medical records from the victim and no one is looking The actor will register for a service using the acquired patient data and the doctors office will likely not notice as they have the required informationThey don't have to fib because it's telehealth and it's believable So the insurance may actually get stuck with a small bill said Holden But the bigger issue is the follow-up banking on urgency the doctors will likely quickly look at test results before the next appointment and end up with an infected file doctored by the Clop actors insteadThis is not the first type of abuse that weve seen said Holden who finds it interesting that Clop is targeting medical professionals rather than others Holden Security has also seen similar scams with the restaurant industry and suppliers But this hits a bit differently because of the sense of dutyThis involves much much deeper human interaction The actors have to discuss actually showing up for the appointment and make sure that they force a doctor to open the infected files he addedClop is well funded and extremely well motivated they can keep attacking Holden stressed that its imperative that the medical industry keeps getting better because there will be times when bad guys will go to the next step They will be blackmailing over the life of a personThe voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media CyberRisk

        "text": "Attackers can compromise a new feature in Amazon Web Services AWS to hijack cloud accounts'static public IP addresses and abuse them for various malicious purposes researchers have foundAttackers also can use the stolen EIP to attack a victim's own firewall-protected endpoints or to serve as the original victims network endpoint to extend opportunities for data theft the researchers saidThe potential damage to the victim by hijacking an EIP and using it for malicious purposes can mean using the victims name jeopardizing the victims other resources in other cloud providerson-premises and stealing thevictims customers' information Or Aspir software engineer at Mitiga wrote in the postThreat actors must already have permissions on an organization's AWS account to leverage the new attack vector which the researchers call a post-initial-compromise attackHowever because the attack was not possible before the feature was added and is not yet listed in the MITRE ATTCK Framework organizations may be unaware that they are vulnerable to it as it's not likely to be picked up by existing security protections the researchers saidWith the right permissions on the victims AWS account a malicious actor using a single API call can transfer the victims used EIP to their own AWS account thus practically gaining control over it Aspir wrote In many cases it allows greatly increasing the impact of the attack and gaining access to even more assetsAWS introduced EIP in October as a legitimate feature to allow transfer of Elastic IP addresses from one AWS account to another An Elastic IP EIP address is a public and static IPv4 address that can be reached from the Internet and can be allocated to an Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 instance for Web-facing activities such as website hosting or communicating with network endpoints under a firewallAWS introduced the feature to make it easier to move Elastic IP addresses during AWS account restructuring by transferring the EIP to any AWS account even AWS accounts that are not owned by someone or his or her organization the researchers saidWith the feature the transfer is a mere two-step handshake between AWS accounts the source account either a standard AWS account or an AWS Organizations account and the transfer account Aspir explainedThe ease with which EIPs can now be transferred creates an unintentional issue however while it certainly facilitates the process of transferring IP for legitimate account owners it also makes it easier for malicious actors as well the researchers saidResearchers described a basic scenario to illustrate how attackers can take advantage of EIP transfer assuming that attackers already have permissions that allow them to see existing EIPs and their status or whether or not they are associated with other computer resourcesTypically EIPs are associated but sometimes an organization keeps dissociated EIP for later use or as a result of an unmanaged environment that keeps unused resources the researchers said Either way the attacker only needs to enable the EIP transfer and the IP address is theirs Aspir wroteAttackers can do this in two ways with the correct permissions either transfer a dissociated EIP or remove the association of an associated EIP and then transfer it the researchers saidFor the former an adversary must have the following action in its attached Identity and Access Management IAM policy on AWS ec2DisassociateAddress action on the elastic IP addresses and the network interfaces that the IP addresses are attached toTo transfer an EIP a threat actor must have the following actions in its attached IAM policy ec2DescribeAddresses on all the IP addresses and ec2EnableAddressTransfer on the EIP address that the attacker wants to transfer the researchers saidThere are a wide range of attack scenarios that a threat actor can engage in after successfully transferring someone else's EIP to their own controlIn external firewalls used by the victim for example an attacker can communicate with the network endpoints behind the firewalls if there is an allow rule on the specific IP address the researchers saidAttackers also can use the stolen IP address as C2 using it for malware campaigns that appear legitimate and thus fly under the radar of security defensives A threat actor can even cause denial of service DoS to a victim's public services if they dissociate an EIP from a running endpoint and transfer it the researchers saidAnyone using EIP resources in an AWS account is at risk and thus must treat the EIP resources like other resources in AWS that are in danger of exfiltration the researchers advisedTo protect themselves from an EIP transfer attack Mitiga recommends that enterprises use the principle of least privilege on AWS accounts and even disable the ability to transfer EIP entirely if it's not a necessary feature on their environmentTo do this an organization can use native AWS IAM features such as service control policies SCPs which offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in an organization the researchers said

        "text": "15 December 2022In fact ThreatFabric analysts discovered an ongoing multi-platform malware campaign targeting both mobile and desktop Brazilian users with thousands of infections and with anestimated loss of hundreds of thousands of Brazilian Reals R which corresponds to tens of thousands of USDThis campaign involves a highly flexible novel Android malware dubbedBrasDexby ThreatFabric featuring a complex keylogging system designed to abuse Accessibility Services to extract credentials specifically from a set of Brazilian targeted apps as well as a highly capable Automated Transfer System ATS engineThe malware has been active for more than a year initially posing as Android settings applications and targeting Brazilian banking applications In its latest campaign it started posing as one specific Banking application Banco Santander BR but continuing to target the same subset of applications as its previous versionsBrasDex abuses accessibility services to keylog the information that is input in the target application veering away from the traditional overlay attack mechanism that we have observed for years now towards what seems to be the next standard in Android banking malwareThis follows a trend that we have started to see in the past year where different malware families have started abandoning the use of overlays which require continuous update and additional downloaded data in favour of more lean and flexible solutions For example in the case of Vultur this solution was to perform screen-recording and subsequently accessibility logging in the case of Cabassous it was to load the real target login page in a browser controlled by the malware with JavaScript enabledHowever in most cases malware families are starting to rely heavily on accessibility logging to exfiltrate logging credentials and other PII from infected victims This is also the case for BrasDex This malware family is able to log not only credentials but also other important information like account balance and then use it to perform a DTO Device TakeOver which allows criminals to perform fraudulent transactions using the infected deviceWhat sets BrasDex apart from many other malware families is its ATS Automated Transfer System capabilities ATS allows malware to programmatically use the information stolen from the victim to initiate fraudulent transactions in an automated way making the whole infection and fraud chain more flexible and scalableThreatFabric has mentioned ATS before in our blogs as one of the most dangerous features present in modern day malware specifically when speaking about Bankers such as Gustuff the first Banker to implement this technique in 2018 and more recently SharkBotBrasDex is a malware family strictly focused on the Brazilian market The malware contains checks to make sure it only operates on devices from Brazil To do so it programmatically checks that the SIM used by the device is operating in Brazil and only then it properly completes its operations and configurations If the device has a SIM card from anywhere else the malware shuts down and never contacts its C2 serverNOTEThreatFabric wants to point out that the Pix system is not vulnerable Actors are not exploiting any vulnerabilities in the Pix System but rather abusing the fast payments system and Android known issues to make fraudulent transfersBloomberg referred to the Pix app as ubiquitous in Brazil in October 2021 a year after Pixs release As of November 2022 Pix has been reported to perform an average of more than 2 million monthly transactions with a user base of more than 120 million peopleOnly in November 2022 Pix was used to perform transactions corresponding to a volume of more than one billion Brazilian Reals R which equals to more than 180 million USD For each targeted bank the step in the ATS script which is responsible for the actual fraudulent transfer performs it through the Pix technology not the traditional bank transfer that many other malware families useThe script will find the UI element corresponding to Pix payments within the banking application use it to start the transfer procedure and then navigate through the different screens selecting the beneficiary and the amount authenticating with the stolen credentials This kind of instant payment does not require Multi Factor Authentication as it can be authorized directly through the banking application itself making it the perfect target for an Android Banking Malware We will later cover in detail an example of a transfer procedure with such technologyThe keylogging technique used by BrasDex abuses the accessibility services privileges and is able to detect and log a large quantity of information from the Operating System With this technique BrasDex is able to log and send to its C2 all the information that is shown on the devices UI including both credentials typed by the user as well as other information that is displayed by the application itself like account balanceIf the application on the foreground is one of the banking applications included in the target list BrasDex also notifies its C2 of events such as opening the application inserting passwords or if the malware is incapable of extracting the required information The malware notifies the C2 whenever one of the following events is detected with the indicated codesThe logged message is formed in the following way in case of no parameters the message ends with the event codeThe information that is collected by the keylogging module is stored locally and sent to the C2 and is automatically fed as parameters into the ATS scripts downloaded with the malware configuration when the malware is first launchedWhat really sets apart this newly discovered malware family from its competition is its advanced and flexible ATS framework First abused by Gustuff enhanced and diffused with SharkBot Automated System Transfer allows the malware to programmatically use the stolen credentials detect the amount of funds that are available in the account and then initiate and approve a transaction all from the infected device itselfIn the case of BrasDex the infected device receives multiple scripts one per targeted application and each containing all the necessary steps to login and perform fraud Each script is made of multiple actions which contain the following fieldsHere is an example of a real action implemented by one of the scriptsBrasDex isable to check for values and type of data contained in all the different fields of the UIfor example if an account contains any funds It is also able to understand and check if UI elements can be clicked and if they contain specific strings used to identify useful information like finding the Continue or Cancel buttonIf the conditions for an action are satisfied it also able to navigate within the UI to highlight and focus the wanted elements wait a set amount of time assign specific values to password fields or beneficiary fields click buttons within the appAs previously mentioned BrasDex targets thePix paymentsystem to perform its fraudIn the image below you can see a few of the different screens that the malware needs to navigate and interact with to successfully perform a successful transaction using PixWe report here a subset of the actions described in the ATS script which interact with the UI elements highlighted in red in the above imageAs you can see from the above JSON objects BrasDex in this case transfers funds to an account identified by a CPF code Cadastro de Pessoas Fsicas a unique individual taxpayer identifier in BrazilThis is another peculiarity of Pix it allows to perform transactions toaccounts which can be identified by CPF but also phone numbers emails or simple unique identifiers The ATS scripts uses the following codes to identify which kind of mule it will be using for the transaction which is communicated by the C2 during its initial configAll kinds of accounts identifiers have been observed being used by BrasDex mulesOnce the malware finally inputs the necessary passwords to finalize the transaction funds are transferred to the destination mule accountWhile investigating this malware family ThreatFabric also managed to get certain visibility of the Panel hosted on the C2 server Based on the information displayed on the panel the malware seems to be quite successful more than a thousand of reported infections The panel contains multiple pages eg the list of infected devices with extensive information which includes the service providers the device model and the Android version In another page actors can access logs obtained from the infected devices with the exfiltrated information as well as reports of successful transactionsHowever what really caught our attention was the main landing page Here we found a dashboard reporting extensive information about a different malware campaign only this time targeting Desktop devicesThis discovery lead to another investigation which allowed us to connect this malware family to another malware familyCasbaneiroThe analysis of the drop points used to distribute BrasDex lead us to a campaign of desktop samples distributed through similar links in Q1 2022 We analyzed those samples and identified Casbaneiro infamous Windows banking Trojan discovered in 2018 as the partner of BrasDexSince the campaign is quite old it could be just a coincidence but our analysis showed clear similarity between BrasDex and Casbaneiro in regards to the communication with their C2 namely the common use of a specific headerHowever to put an end to the debate while writing our blog we discovered an ongoing campaign of BrasDex and Casbaneiro distributed through the same drop point thus allowing us to conclude that Casbaneiro is the a desktop malware operated by same actors behind BrasDexThe latest desktop campaign is the same in MO as previous ones and we will briefly highlight the most notable parts of the desktop campaignIt was delivered throughphishing e-mailsabout a failed delivery pretending to be from the

payload that is decoded and executed by the script Thus this multi-staged process results in the a Delphi payload running on the Windows machineWhen analyzing the final payload our analysts identified it as Casbaneiro based on the same communication protocol strings and obfuscation mechanisms used The sample analyzed uses the same decryption algorithms for string and payload decryption as in previously described campaigns The latest sample analyzed has a compilation date of December 5th 2022Casbaneiro is a Windows banking Trojan written in Delphi that targets users of online banking as well as users of desktop banking applications It is able to collect the data about the infected device take screenshots and perform keylogging hijack clipboard data etcThe following Bitcoin wallet is hardcoded in Casbaneiro to be used to replace a cryptocurrency wallet copied by victim in clipboardWhen running Casbaneiro monitors the launched processes and opened URLs to find those related to banking applications It also downloads bank-specific pictures from Google Drive and uses them to steal 2FA codes from victim This last step is done to authenticate to banking application on the actors device For one of the banks such pictures contain QR-codes generated by the actors the victim is tricked into scanning them with the mobile banking application and as a result a new desktop device controlled by cyber-criminals will be authenticated and will have access to victims banking accountBeing independent and full-fledged malware families BrasDex and Casbaneiro form a very dangerous pair allowing the actor behind them to target both Android and Windows users on a large scaleMoreover the appearance of convenient payment systems not only makes payments comfortable for customers but also opens an opportunity for cyber-criminals to use it for fraudulent operations The BrasDex case shows the necessity of fraud detection and prevention mechanisms in place on customers devices fraudulent payments made automatically with the help of ATS engines appear legitimate to bank backends and fraud scoring engines as they are made through the same device that is usually used by customer Thus a

        "text": "Solutions forResearchers find a new reliable way to track the location of wireless Wi-Fi devices December 16 2022Before looking at the report in detail lets consider a real-life attack Attackers fly a mini-quadcopter with the most inexpensive microcomputer on board around a target building collecting data to obtain a map of wireless devices inside with reasonable accuracy 15 meters under ideal conditions But why would they Well lets imagine its a bank or a top-secret laboratory whose security systems are equipped with Wi-Fi modules And theres your why their location could be of huge practical interest to attackers planning physical penetrationSo how do researchers imitate something like thatThe Wi-Peep attack exploits two important features of absolutely any Wi-Fi device from ancient wireless modules from 20 years ago to the most modern The first is the power-saving mechanism in Wi-Fi devices The Wi-Fi module say in a smartphone can preserve battery by shutting down the wireless receiver for short periods of time A wireless access point needs to consider this mode of operation your router can accumulate data packets for a specific device then transmit them all at once when it signals its ready again to receive a transmissionFor a successful attack a potential spy would need to obtain a list of MAC addresses unique device IDs whose locations would be determined later Devices in the same home office or hotel are usually connected to a shared Wi-Fi network the name of which is no secret It turned out that its possible to send a fake data packet ostensibly from this shared wireless network informing all connected devices that the access-point buffer has accumulated some data destined for them In reply to this signal the devices send responses which when analyzed reveal the unique MAC addresses of all network devices almost instantly But theres a simpler way eavesdrop on wireless radio traffic however this takes more time according to the researchers you need to accumulate data in passive mode for 12 hoursWhat does that give Moving around a stationary wireless device we can determine its coordinates with a fairly high degree of accuracy knowing our own location and the distance to the object of interest Much of the research is devoted to overcoming the many difficulties of this method The signal from the Wi-Fi radio transmitter is constantly reflected by walls and other obstacles making it difficult to calculate the distance In fact that standardized response time should be 10 microseconds but it actually varies from device to device ranging from 8 to 13 microseconds The geolocation accuracy of the attackers Wi-Fi module itself also has an effect it turns out that even the precision of geopositioning systems GPS GLONASS etc isnt always enough Although the resulting data contains a lot of noise if enough measurements are made relatively high accuracy can be achieved That means if you make tens of thousands of readings you get a positioning accuracy with an error in the range of 126 to 230 meters on the horizontal plane On the vertical the researchers were able to determine the exact floor in 91 of cases but nothing moreAlthough the system for determining the coordinates of wireless devices turned out to be not very accurate its still of interest not least because the equipment used by the researchers is dirt-cheap Theoretically an attack can be carried out by a potential spy in person simply by slowly walking around the target object For added convenience the researchers used a cheap quadcopter fitted with a microcomputer based on the ESP32 chipset and a wireless module The total cost of this reconnaissance kit excluding the cost of the quadcopter is less than US20 Whats more the attack is virtually impossible to trace on the victims device It uses the standard capabilities of Wi-Fi modules which cannot be disabled or at least modified in terms of behavior If communication between the victims device and the attackers microcomputer is possible in principle the attack will work The practical range of data transmission over Wi-Fi is tens of meters which in most cases will sufficeIf we assume the attack is doable in real life is the data obtained of any use The researchers propose several scenarios First and most obviously if we know the MAC address of the smartphone of a specific individual we can roughly track their movements in public places This is possible even if their smartphone is not connected to any wireless networks at the time of the attack Second creating a map of wireless devices in a secure building a competitors office bank premises for a subsequent physical attack is an entirely realistic scenario For example attackers can determine the approximate location of surveillance cameras if these use Wi-Fi for data transmissionThere are also less obvious benefits from collecting such data You could for instance collect information about the number of Wi-Fi devices in a hotel to estimate how many guests there are Such data may be of interest to competitors Or knowing the number of wireless devices could help determine if potential victims are at home Even the MAC addresses themselves without coordinates are of some use for collecting statistics about smartphone usage in a public place In addition to spying and burglary such methods are a threat to peoples privacyHowever the immediate risk of such a method being deployed in practice is still quite low This applies to all potential attacks and data collection methods for which you have to get close to the target object Its quite labor-intensive for one thing meaning that few would do it on a mass scale and for targeted attacks other methods may be more effective At the same time scientific research helps to understand how minor features of complex technologies can be harnessed for malicious purposes The researchers themselves note that the real benefit of their work will be if this small security and privacy risk is eliminated in future versions of wireless data transmission technologiesWhy you shouldnt trust a random period-tracking app and what to look out for when choosing

        "text": "One year after the Log4Shell vulnerability was discovered researchers tell SC Media that widespread exposure remains rampant as the sky-high costs of detection and remediation start to come into focus Image credit style-photography via GettyA year ago when the Log4Shell vulnerability was first disclosed perhaps no sector responded as quickly and decisively as the federal governmentWithin days of the bugs disclosure the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security issued an emergency directive ordering civilian federal agencies to identify all software solution stacks accepting data input from the internet map them to a government-run GitHub repository of known software assets using the vulnerable code patch known affected instances and request additional scrutiny for internet connected solutions that were not on the list Agencies were given less than week to patch their affected systems or pull them from the internetOn top of all that CISA led a frenetic national coordination effort to remediate the bug pulling in cybersecurity experts members of industry major software and hardware providers and other stakeholders to spread awareness identify affected assets and reduce the nations overall attack surface by patching as many systems as possible If any organization was going to be able to quickly find and inoculate themselves from Log4j it should have been the federal government From the time it was introduced researchers warned that Log4Shell would remain in the digital ecosystem for years The Iranian incident underscores just how difficult it has been even for motivated and well-resourced organizations to stay on top of the threat and remove it from their networksIn a statement sent to SC Media CISA executive director Eric Goldstein did not directly answer questions about why the compromise was not found until months after agencies were ordered to scour their internal software but noted that discovery efforts would be an ongoing effort and that while organizations across government and the private sector acted with urgency to mitigate assets running vulnerable versions of Log4j we know that malicious cyber actors moved quickly to exploit vulnerable assets and continue to do soSC Media spoke with security researchers and vendors who have been tracking similar failures across the private sector with alarming numbers of known internet-connected assets still vulnerable to Log4j todayAccording to Sonatype the software supply-chain firm that runsApache Maven Central the largest Java package repository one out of every four Log4j instances downloaded from the repositoryare still vulnerable today More disturbingly researchers from Tenable found that 72 of organizations worldwide remain vulnerable to the Log4Shell highlighting its sticking power and remediation challengesThese earth-shattering data is a lesson to the security community and we clearly have a long way to go Brian Fox cofounder and chief technology officer at Sonatype said in an interview Log4Shell is hard to eradicate due to the sheer size of its attack surface and how easy it is to exploit Bugs in an operating system or a popular browser typically only affect the users of that system or browser and the problem will be fixed once the security team patches the issue Log4Shell is different By targeting the logging systems that countless developers have relied on it has a much larger attack surface and compromised millions of vulnerable Java applications and services worldwide including Cloudflare iCloud Minecraft servers Steam TencentQQ and Twitter In addition attackers can easily exploit the vulnerability as it does not require any privileged access or special configuration All they have to do is to locate an input field that gets logged and write a simple string of code said Yotam Perkal director of vulnerability research at Rezilion In response to the ubiquitous nature of Log4Shellsecurity teams in the private sector have spent days and nights to detect and patch vulnerable versionsin a timely manner However hunting Log4Shell is easier said than done Software projects are usually built on top of a mountain of dependencies where developers incorporate external software libraries into the projects and add additional functionality While some developers knowingly and directly use log4j in their software others may have code that relies on other open source programs in order function and those programs could also be vulnerable This weakness known as transitive dependency means undocumented pieces of code may bury the vulnerable versions of Log4Shell multiple levels deep in data said Stephen Magill vice president of product innovation at Sonatype According to Magill approximately 70000 open-source projects use log4j as a direct dependency while nearly 174000 projects use it as a transitive dependency 70000 is already a substantial number showing that many projects are directly vulnerable But if you add on transitive dependency the number of affected projects is more than doubled making hunting and remediation even more difficult Magill said To fully detect the vulnerable versions in all dependencies organizations need to be more patient with running their test said Jason Kent hacker in residence at Cequence Security We found that a lot of organizations do not wait long enough with their tests They only wait for five minutes after they send the test in and then they move on to the next test The vulnerable versions can be deep in multiple layers and we have seen 24 or 48 hours before something triggers and sends it back to us Kent explained However Kent said that even if organizations fully detect the vulnerable versions and patch them quickly they still should not drop their guard as Log4Shell can be reintroduced to the applications anytime developers add new systems or assets to their environments Indeed recent research by Tenable shows that among the vulnerable assets identified during the initial disclosure nearly one-third 29 of them had recurrences of Log4Shell after full remediation was achieved The addition of new systems and assets is the most frequent action that inadvertently reintroduces Log4Shell If organizations do not address the issue on the left side in the build pipeline they will continue to deploy vulnerable code said Bob Huber chief security officer and head of research at Tenable As it stands many organizations address the issue on the right side in their runtime environment only to be replaced with another insecure build Identifying every instance of insecure code in use is nontrivial for most organizations including third partiesBesides the Iranian government-sponsored attack disclosed last month multiple othernation-state-backed actors have been reported using Log4Shell to compromise target networks In March for example Chinese threat actor Deep Panda has been observed to use an identical vector to deploy a backdoor and attack mainly US-based government entities while the North Koreas Lazarus group has been found using the same technique to conduct cyber espionage and ransomware attacksJust because people dont see headlines does not mean the attacks are not happening Fox saidWhen it comes to evaluating the impact of Log4Shell organizations should not only look at the number of publicly disclosed attacks but also consider the economic cost of detection and remediation said Dan Lorenc founder and CEO of Chainguard Hunting and patching Log4Shell is very costly Over the past year it has cost companies billions of dollars to get through the mitigations along with a lot of security folks sacrificing their weekends and holiday breaks to handle the issues Lorenc said To quantify the cost and draw a more comprehensive picture of Log4Shell Arctic Wolf noted that the average cost of a Log4j incident response over the past year has amounted to 90000 while GuidePoint Security suggested that the cost for a single Log4j hunt can also reach to 33000The high cost was due to numerous factors including the breadth of Log4j across various software and solutions as well as the clients inability to easily identify where it was running whether it was vulnerable and even potentially exploited Therefore we seem to receive more requests for assistance in helping clients perform these tasks which obviously has supplemental costs to their typical vulnerability management processes said Mark Lance vice president of DFIR and Threat Intelligence at GuidePoint Security Also given that the vulnerability took almost the whole IT department security teams and application owners and even many non-security-oriented teams effort in the first month of its disclosure I would estimate the mitigation of Log4j took up 10 to 12 budget from each team including incident response over the past year Alex Kozodoy cyber research manager at Deep Instinct addedSecurity researchers said that organizations should take those losses as lessons that could help them better balance the prevention and mitigation of vulnerabilities in the upcoming year I figured all organizations knew about their network vulnerabilities But what I have learned from Log4Shell is that is not the case Most organizations no matter how large or small they are are truly blind to what they have exposed to the internet said Justin Fier VP of Tactical Risk and Response at Darktrace Be sure to get your organizational bill of materials under control If I told you about a new vulnerability right now and you cannot answer me if you are using that component anywhere in your portfolio you should better get started because the next Log4Shell may be right around the corner

        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather DEV-1028 is now tracked as Storm-1028 Malware operations continue to rapidly evolve as threat actors add new capabilities to existing botnets increasingly targeting and recruiting new types of devices Attackers update malware to target additional operating systems ranging from PCs to IoT devices growing their infrastructure rapidly The Microsoft Defender for IoT research team recently analyzed a cross-platform botnet that originates from malicious software downloads on Windows devices and succeeds in propagating to a variety of Linux-based devicesThe botnet spreads by enumerating default credentials on internet-exposed Secure Shell SSH-enabled devices Because IoT devices are commonly enabled for remote configuration with potentially insecure settings these devices could be at risk to attacks like this botnet The botnets spreading mechanism makes it a unique threat because while the malware can be removed from the infected source PC it could persist on unmanaged IoT devices in the network and continue to operate as part of the botnetMicrosoft tracks this cluster of activity as DEV-1028 a cross-platform botnet that infects Windows devices Linux devices and IoT devices The DEV-1028 botnet is known to launch distributed denial of service DDoS attacks against private Minecraft serversOur analysis of the DDoS botnet revealed functionalities specifically designed to target private Minecraft Java servers using crafted packets most likely as a service sold on forums or darknet sites A breakdown of the systems affected by the botnet over the three months from the time of this analysis also revealed that most of the devices were in RussiaThis type of threat stresses the importance of ensuring that organizations manage keep up to date and monitor not just traditional endpoints but also IoT devices that are often less secure In this blog post we share details on how this botnet affects multiple platforms its DDoS capabilities and recommendations for organizations to prevent their devices from becoming part of a botnet We also share Minecraft server version information for owners of private servers to update and ensure they are protected from this threatMicrosoft researchers observed that the initial infection points related to the botnet were devices infected through the installation of malicious cracking tools that purport to acquire illegal Windows licensesThe cracking tools contain additional code that downloads and launches a fake version of svchostexe through a PowerShell command In some cases the downloaded file is named svchostsexeNext svchostexe launches maliciouspy the main Python script that contains all the logic of the botnet whichthen scans the internet for SSH-enabled Linux-based devices Debian Ubuntu CentOS and IoT workloads such as Raspbian which are commonly enabled for remote configuration and launches a dictionary attack to propagate Once a device is found it downloads the file Updaterzip from repoarkeventnet onto the device which creates the file fuse The fuse file then downloads a copy of maliciouspy onto the device Both svchostexe and fuse are compiled using PyInstaller which bundles all the Python runtime and libraries necessary to initiate maliciouspyWhile maliciouspy has specific functionalities depending on whether the file launches on a Windows or Linux-based device for Windows the file establishes persistency by adding the registry key SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun with the executable as the value the executable is compiled to operate on both Windows and Linux-based devices The file communicates with its command-and-control C2 server to launch the following commandsBased on our analysis the botnet is primarily used to launch DDoS attacks against private Minecraft servers using known server DDoS commands and unique Minecraft commands Below is the list of commands established in the codeWhile most of the commands are methods of DDoS the most notable command run by the botnet is ATTACKMCCRASH The command sends envrandom payload of specific size-a as the username in order to exhaust the resources of the server and make it crashTCP payloads on port 25565 have the following binary structureThe usage of the env variable triggers the use of Log4j 2 library which causes abnormal consumption of system resources not related to Log4Shell vulnerability demonstrating a specific and highly efficient DDoS methodWhile testing the impact of the malware researchers found that the malware itself was hardcoded to target a specific version of Minecraft server 1122 However all versions between 172 and 1182 can be affected by this method of attack There is a slight modification in the Minecraft protocol in server version 119 which was released earlier in 2022 that prevents the use of the Minecraft specific commands the ATTACKMCCRASH ATTACKMCBOTMINE and ATTACKMCDATA without modification of the attack codeThe wide range of at-risk Minecraft servers highlights the impact this malware could have had if it was specifically coded to affect versions beyond 1122 The unique ability of this threat to utilize IoT devices that are often not monitored as part of the botnet substantially increases its impact and reduces its chances of being detectedTo harden devices networks against threats like MCCrash organizations must implement the basics to secure identities and their devices including access limitation Solutions must detect downloads of malicious programs and malicious attempts to gain access to SSH-enabled devices and generate alerts on anomalous network behaviorBelow are some of our recommendations for organizationsMicrosoft Defender AntivirusMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects the malware used in this attack as the followingMicrosoft Defender for EndpointMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint alerts with the following titles can indicate threat activity on your networkMicrosoft Defender for IoTMCCrash-related activity on IoT devices would raise the following alerts in Microsoft Defender for IoTMicrosoft Defender for CloudMicrosoft Defender for Cloud raises the following alert for related activityMicrosoft 365 DefenderRun the following queries to

        "text": "An Android malware campaign dubbed MoneyMonger has been found hidden in money-lending apps developed using Flutter It's emblematic of a rising tide of blackmailing cybercriminals targeting consumers and their employers stand to feel the effects tooAccording to research from the Zimperium zLabs team the malware uses multiple layers of social engineering to take advantage of its victims and allows malicious actors to steal private information from personal devices then use that information to blackmail individualsThe MoneyMonger malware distributed through third-party app stores and sideloaded onto victims' Android devices was built from the ground up to be malicious targeting those in need of quick cash according to Zimperium researchers It uses multiple layers of social engineering to take advantage of its victims beginning with a predatory loan scheme and promising quick money to those who follow a few simple instructionsIn the process of setting up the app the victim is told that permissions are needed on the mobile endpoint to ensure they are in good standing to receive a loan These permissions are then used to collect and exfiltrate data including from the contact list GPS location data a list of installed apps sound recordings call logs SMS lists and storage and file lists It also gains camera accessThis stolen information is used to blackmail and threaten victims into paying excessively high-interest rates If the victim fails to pay on time and in some cases even after the loan is repaid the malicious actors threaten to reveal information call people from the contact list and even send photos from the deviceOne of the new and interesting things about this malware is how it uses the Flutter software development kit to hide malicious codeWhile the open source user interface UI software kit Flutter has been a game changer for application developers malicious actors have also taken advantage of its capabilities and framework deploying apps with critical security and privacy risks to unsuspecting victimsRichard Melick director of mobile threat intelligence at Zimperium tells Dark Reading that consumers using money lending apps are most at risk but by the nature of this threat and how attackers steal sensitive information for blackmail they are also putting their employers or any organization they work with at risk tooIts very easy for the attackers behind MoneyMonger to steal information from corporate email downloaded files personal emails phone numbers or other enterprise apps on the phone using it to extort their victims he saysMelick says MoneyMonger is a risk to individuals and enterprises because it collects a wide range of data from the victims device including potentially sensitive enterprise-related material and proprietary informationAny device connected to enterprise data poses a risk to the enterprise if an employee falls victim to the MoneyMonger predatory loan scam on that device he says Victims of this predatory loan might be compelled to steal to pay the blackmail or not report the theft of critical enterprise data by the malicious actors behind the campaignMelick says that personal mobile devices represent a significant unaddressed attack surface for enterprises He points out that malware against mobile only continues to get more advanced and without the threat telemetry and critical defense in place to stand up against this growing subset of malicious activity enterprises and their employees are left at riskNo matter if they are corporate-owned or part of a BYOD strategy the need for security is critical to stay ahead of MoneyMonger and other advanced threats he says Education is only part of the key here and technology can fill in the gaps minimizing the risk and attack surface presented by MoneyMonger and other threatsIt's also important to remember to avoid downloading apps from unofficial app stores official stores like Google Play do have protections for users a Google spokesperson emphasized to Dark ReadingNone of the identified malicious apps in the report are on Google Play he said Google Play Protect checks Android devices with Google Play Services for potentially harmful apps from other sources Google Play Protect will warn users that attempt to install or launch apps that have been identified to be maliciousMelick points out blackmail is not new to malicious actors as has been seen in ransomware attacks and data breaches on a global scaleThe use of blackmail on such a personal level targeting individual victims though is a bit of a novel approach that takes an investment of personnel and time he says But it is paying off and based on the number of reviews and complaints around MoneyMonger and other predatory loan scams similar to this it is only going to continueHe predicts market and financial conditions will leave some people desperate for ways to pay bills or get extra cashJust as we saw predatory loan scams rise up in the last recession he says it is almost guaranteed we will see this model of theft and blackmail continue into 2023Copyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company

        "text": "The US Department of Justice DOJ today seized four-dozen domains that sold booter or stresser services businesses that make it easy and cheap for even non-technical users to launch powerful Distributed Denial of Service DDoS attacks designed knock targets offline The DOJ also charged six US men with computer crimes related to their alleged ownership of the popular DDoS-for-hire servicesThe booter service OrphicSecurityTeamcom was one of the 48 DDoS-for-hire domains seized by the Justice Department this weekThe DOJ said the 48 domains it seized helped paying customers launch millions of digital sieges capable of knocking Web sites and even entire network providers offlineBooter services are advertised through a variety of methods including Dark Web forums chat platforms and even youtubecom They accept payment via PayPal Google Wallet andor cryptocurrencies and subscriptions can range in price from just a few dollars to several hundred per month The services are generally priced according to the volume of traffic to be hurled at the target the duration of each attack and the number of concurrent attacks allowedProsecutors in Los Angeles say the booter sites supremesecurityteamcom and royalstressercom were the brainchild of Jeremiah Sam Evans Miller aka John the Dev a 23-year-old from San Antonio Texas Miller was charged this week with conspiracy and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act CFAA The complaint against Miller alleges Royalstresser launched nearly 200000 DDoS attacks between November 2021 and February 2022 Defendant Angel Manuel Colon Jr aka Anonghost720 and Anonghost1337 is a 37-year-old from Belleview Fla Colon is suspected of running the booter service securityteamio He was also charged with conspiracy and CFAA violations The feds say the SecurityTeam stresser service conducted 13 million attacks between 2018 and 2022 and attracted some 50000 registered usersCharged with conspiracy were Corey Anthony Palmer 22 of Lauderhill Fla for his alleged ownership of bootersx and Shamar Shattock 19 of Margate Fla for allegedly operating the booter service astrostresscom which had more than 30000 users and blasted out some 700000 attacksTwo other alleged booter site operators were charged in Alaska John M Dobbs 32 of Honolulu HI is charged with aiding and abetting violations of the CFAA related to the operation of IPStressercom which he allegedly ran for nearly 13 years until last month During that time IPstresser launched approximately 30 million DDoS attacks and garnered more than two million registered usersJoshua Laing 32 of Liverpool NY also was charged with CFAA infractions tied to his alleged ownership of the booter service TrueSecurityServicesio which prosecutors say had 18000 users and conducted over 12 million attacks between 2018 and 2022Purveyors of stressers and booters claim they are not responsible for how customers use their services and that they arent breaking the law because like most security tools stresser services can be used for good or bad purposes For example all of the above-mentioned booter sites contained wordy terms of use agreements that required customers to agree they will only stress-test their own networks and that they wont use the service to attack othersOur terms of use are a legal document that protects us among other things from certain legal consequences Dobbs told ZDNet Most other sites are satisfied with a simple checkbox but we ask for a digital signature in order to imply real consent from our customersBut the DOJ says these disclaimers usually ignore the fact that most booter services are heavily reliant on constantly scanning the Internet to commandeer misconfigured devices that are critical for maximizing the size and impact of DDoS attacksAnalysis of data related to the FBI-initiated attacks revealed that the attacks launched by the SUBJECT DOMAINS involved the extensive misuse of third-party services Peterson continued All of the tested services offered amplification attacks where the attack traffic is amplified through unwitting third-party servers in order to increase the overall attack size and to shift the financial burden of generating and transmitting all of that data away from the booter site administrators and onto third partiesAccording to US federal prosecutors the use of booter and stresser services to conduct attacks is punishable under both wire fraud laws and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 USC 1030 and may result in arrest and prosecution the seizure of computers or other electronics as well as prison sentences and a penalty or fine The charges unsealed today stemmed from investigations launched by the FBIs field offices in Los Angeles and Alaska which spent months purchasing and testing attack services offered by the booter sites The Justice Department says it is trying to impress upon people that even buying attacks from DDoS-for-hire services can land Internet users in legal jeopardy Whether a criminal launches an attack independently or pays a skilled contractor to carry one out the FBI will work with victims and use the considerable tools at our disposal to identify the person or group responsible said Donald Alway the assistant director in charge of the FBIs Los Angeles field office Potential users and administrators should think twice before buying or selling these illegal services said Special Agent Antony Jung of the FBI Anchorage field office The FBI and our international law enforcement partners continue to intensify efforts in combatting DDoS attacks which will have serious consequences for offenders The purpose of the ads is to deter potential cyber criminals searching for DDoS services in the United States and around the globe as well as to educate the public on the illegality of DDoS activities the DOJ said in a press releaseHere is the full list of booter site domains seized or in the process of being seized by the

futuree owners of these types of service wohoo great post krebsWooHooo Go Krebscriminals deserve to go in jail once again congrats on the fbiAgreed great post The statistics on number of DDoS attacks and customers of these systems boggle the mind What motivates this is it extortion akin to ransomwareYou rarely see DDoS for ransomNo barelly anyone does it for ransom mostly its for the sole feeling of power ddosing other peoples vpns sites games like r6 because if you ddos it it will crash and ur lost wont countIm curious to know from others how can one properly test their networks for validating DDoS protection etc if not using a third party booter serviceThere are legitimate stressors RedWolf Security that leverage hyperscalers with their approval to generate DDoS load You may also want to ask the Cloud Provider or on-prem provider if managed support is on contract for permission as most of the times it violates their AUP or TCs Stressing origin with DDoS for due diligence is the same concept as Pen testing for WAF Ipso FactoThanks for this much appreciatedKeep your software patched and your ports tightdamn bro what am i going to use nowDamn this is so sad The FBI and CIA are honestly slow mentally They cannot get all of them I do do not condone DDoS attacks these are horrible and NEED to stopAs a legit service owner who is fighting against DDoS attacks on a weekly

talks about one individual he got in contact with I hope all the money they made with the sites gets confiscated and they all realize how many people they have hurt in timeThis is so a fantastic article Thanks for sharing this informative blog I have become a fan of your blogs and this blog is so exciting and informativeI predict the prosecutor will question why there was no form of technical verification of ownership against targets before the attacks were permitted It wouldnt be hard to automate a check against DNS records robotstxt whois info or web beaconIf they allowed their service to be used for only legitimate testing the authorities probably wouldnt have cared even with the abuse of misconfigured devicesDNS records dont matter here I can set up a DNS record pointing to your IP addressWhat matters are IP addresses and ASASNsThere are reverse DNS records but theyre generally not used for things like this to my knowledgeI dont know of an ASN oriented approachYou could probably require a timestamped https response from a server based on a certificate for a public IP address That doesnt show authorization to send traffic to the AS And someone could hack a computer to put up this and answer that query Should that really be all thats necessary for a service to decide its ok to send traffic Id say noId want actual money to cover liability Way more than the pennies these hacking sites possibly charge Enough to cover damages when it turns out that the procured service was a malicious attackIm still getting attacked so apparently there are more out there Look at how many are in florida hahahaif you think that public stressers are the only services out there then you are bigly misstakenThey should go after the customers and if the penalties are not high enough then theCongress should raise them Dry up the demand and that will limit the booters Also make it easy for the booters and their customers to be sued by the victims It is all about money for the booters after allyou cant go after the costumers as its run on their servers thats their whole unique selling pointWell everyone thinks going after the stressers will stop ddos attacks and they are wrong all is going to happen is the next bored kid at home will open another one targeting the main providers that sale spoof Hostings its how you slow this attacks down because stopping it maybe impossible since this days any 13 year old can run a script and have a botnet Running is like saying GitHub should be taking down by the fbi because most of this scripts are in GitHub but like you said we cant control what everyone does with the scriptsThe law enforcement is doing nothing except making the market in the DDoS community grow The more stressers that get taken down the less competition other stress owners have to deal with If they try to take them all down it just makes the service worth moreI completely Agree I am one of the people named in the post And they dont understand ddos is not an issue that just comes from the usa they also come from other countrys with poor laws and kids know that ive been telling many people stop ddosing ever since i found out the seriousness of it and i was raided and all they say is my country dont care about ddos some kid even has the nerves to say his country gives him 5 warnings before prosecutingThe law enforcement is doing nothing except making the market in the DDoS community grow The more stressers that get taken down the less competition other stress owners have to deal with If they try to take them all down it just makes the service worth moreThis is stupid and uneducated Half of these stressers are already back up on different domains and there customers have been redirected there via telegram groups etcNobody yet spotted that the FBI agent running the case Elliott Peterson managed to get elliotnscloudflarecom as one of the nameserversI want a vanity nameserver tooSo its illegal because these guys used other folks devices in their botnet for hire without the network device owners permission breaking cfaa Pretty simple Now if however they owned all the devices andor has explicit permission to do use said devices for their stress test service then thats totally different but again if you are legitimate then you would log who used the services and what proposesWell CyberHero Krebs you DO know a thing or two about getting DDoSed now dont you LOL Which makes me wonder if you have seen any increased ner-do-well activity along the lines of MiraiBASHLITEMioriSpeakUp offerings as perhaps stealthier alternatives to these DDoSaaS stresser-sites that are apparently finally receiving well-deserved scrutiny How many more nanny cams DVRs thermostats and window blinds are being conscripted as we speak to fill in the voidEvery user on the planet that cares about the current and future state of security and safety on the Internet owes their personal gratitude to Cyberhero Brian CBK Krebs for continuing non-stop to put his ass on the line in endless pursuit of the ner-do-wells and threat actors too LOL who want to take all of the good out of what could be a really really really good World Wide Web Sounds flowery Its trueMany thanks to Bruce Schneier as wellPS Brian thanks to your frequent allusions to Mr Robot I finally started watching it on Netflix tonight where in the HECK

        "text": "InfraGard a program run by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI to build cyber and physical threat information sharing partnerships with the private sector this week saw its database of contact information on more than 80000 members go up for sale on an English-language cybercrime forum Meanwhile the hackers responsible are communicating directly with members through the InfraGard portal online using a new account under the assumed identity of a financial industry CEO that was vetted by the FBI itselfOn Dec 10 2022 the relatively new cybercrime forum Breached featured a bombshell new sales thread The user database for InfraGard including names and contact information for tens of thousands of InfraGard membersThe FBIs InfraGard program is supposed to be a vetted Whos Who of key people in private sector roles involving both cyber and physical security at companies that manage most of the nations critical infrastructures including drinking water and power utilities communications and financial services firms transportation and manufacturing companies healthcare providers and nuclear energy firmsInfraGard connects critical infrastructure owners operators and stakeholders with the FBI to provide education networking and information-sharing on security threats and risks the FBIs InfraGard fact sheet readsIn response to information shared by KrebsOnSecurity the FBI said it is aware of a potential false account associated with the InfraGard Portal and that it is actively looking into the matterThis is an ongoing situation and we are not able to provide any additional information at this time the FBI said in a written statementKrebsOnSecurity contacted the seller of the InfraGard database a Breached forum member who uses the handle USDoD and whose avatar is the seal of the US Department of DefenseUSDoDs InfraGard sales thread on BreachedUSDoD said they gained access to the FBIs InfraGard system by applying for a new account using the name Social Security Number date of birth and other personal details of a chief executive officer at a company that was highly likely to be granted InfraGard membershipThe CEO in question currently the head of a major US financial corporation that has a direct impact on the creditworthiness of most Americans told KrebsOnSecurity they were never contacted by the FBI seeking to vet an InfraGard applicationUSDoD told KrebsOnSecurity their phony application was submitted in November in the CEOs name and that the application included a contact email address that they controlled but also the CEOs real mobile phone numberWhen you register they said that to be approved can take at least three months USDoD said I wasnt expected to be approvedBut USDoD said that in early December their email address in the name of the CEO received a reply saying the application had been approved see redacted screenshot to the right While the FBIs InfraGard system requires multi-factor authentication by default users can choose between receiving a one-time code via SMS or emailIf it was only the phone I will be in a bad situation USDoD said Because I used the persons phone that Im impersonatingUSDoD said the InfraGard user data was made easily available via an Application Programming Interface API that is built into several key components of the website that help InfraGard members connect and communicate with each otherUSDoD said after their InfraGard membership was approved they asked a friend to code a script in Python to query that API and retrieve all available InfraGard user dataInfraGard is a social media intelligence hub for high profile persons USDoD said They even got a forum to discuss thingsTo prove they still had access to InfraGard as of publication time Tuesday evening USDoD sent a direct note through InfraGards messaging system to an InfraGard member whose personal details were initially published as a teaser on the database sales threadThat InfraGard member who is head of security at a major US technology firm confirmed receipt of USDoDs message but asked to remain anonymous for this storyUSDoD acknowledged that their 50000 asking price for the InfraGard database may be a tad high given that it is a fairly basic list of people who are already very security-conscious Also only about half of the user accounts contain an email address and most of the other database fields like Social Security Number and Date of Birth are completely emptyI dont think someone will pay that price but I have to price it a bit higher to negotiate the price that I want they explainedWhile the data exposed by the infiltration at InfraGard may be minimal the user data might not have been the true end game for the intrudersUSDoD said they were hoping the imposter account would last long enough for them to finish sending direct messages as the CEO to other executives using the InfraGuard messaging portal USDoD shared the following redacted screenshot from what they claimed was one such message although they provided no additional context about itA screenshot shared by USDoD showing a message thread in the FBIs InfraGard systemUSDoD said in their sales thread that the guarantor for the transaction would be Pompompurin the administrator of the cybercrime forum Breached By purchasing the database through the forum administrators escrow service would-be buyers can theoretically avoid getting ripped off and ensure the transaction will be consummated to the satisfaction of both parties before money exchanges handsUpdate 1058 pm ET Updated the story after hearing from the financial company CEO whose identity was used to fool the FBI into approving an InfraGard membership That CEO said they were never contacted by the FBIUpdate 1115 pm ET The FBI just confirmed that it is aware of a potential false account associated with the InfraGard portal The story now includes their full statementThis is a developing story Updates will be noted here with timestamps This entry was posted on Tuesday 13th of December 2022 0654 PM Interesting articleThis sounds like it could be very promising Would InfraGard be a good source of up to date information about attacks and scams and how to deal with them Has anyone here been a member and found them usefulMainly OSINT Ive never found it to be useful Generally just delete emails from themSame Attended a single meeting but heard nothing I couldnt gather from staying on top of industry news cyclesAs an InfraFard member I value the formal purpose and intention of the group In the event of a realized threat due to the association to critical infrastructure new communication channels become available in realtime due to ones association to critical infrastructure not just because your a member of InfraGard But InfraGard thru its association to Homeland and the FBI would be one of the channels used to share informationIndependent of your Chapter Im in Chicago there is also informal sharing of information by the members The informal sharing via private forums and email is in near real-time Over the years these informal shares are real-time and not yet in the news If you are associated to critical infrastructure yes this is a valuable organization to be a member It compliments your other formal associations And opens your informal networking to a group of your peers who are both business leaders and often nerdy enough to know the consequences of the technology being compromised For sure if you qualify it is a group of peers who are likely making decisions about threats to the Confidentiality Integrity and Availability CIA of critical infrastructure from either a global national state regional or own business perspectiveI believe the issue a lot of us security prosInfraGard members have to do with the content is exemplified in your post Many InfraGard presentations have a lot of windbaggery and grandstanding with the non-technical or very outdated technically presenters going on and on about basic topics of infosec management The fact that you took pains to expand the CIA triad InfoSec 101 and state globalregional is typical of these presentationsIve never seen a situation where InfraGard supplied information helped any organization get ahead of any threatssounds like a skill issuehelloIve always found the threat intel very useful Yes I can find it from other sources Mandiant Talos etc but I find that at least Infragard contains all of the information and not distilled to a set of products The local chapter meetings have been very useful as wellAside from the general OSINT it really depends on the Chapter you are a member of Some chapters are more active than others My chapter has actually put on a fair amount of seminars with experts on various aspects of security both physical and cyber I find these live events to be the far more compelling aspect of membershipAgreedYes its good for that purposeOoopsWhoopsieI am in InfraGuard member and the FBI has not disclosed the breach and the potential exposure of my PII to meIf I did not follow Krebs I would not know The District of Columbia does have breach notification requirements on the books do they not applyAhLate news bulletin for youSorry you skipped the US civics classbut who has the time for the mundaneWe are a Federal republic with 53 separate state entities and 3000 countiesEach has the power to enact separate laws as long as they dont conflict with the Feds or its own states lawsGot thatDC can pass any municipal law it wants no effect on the local FBI HQ your pointCongress by the archaic sclerotic 1787 Constitution rules both the FBI and DCMuch good luck on your further studies of our basic US governing documentsGlad to have helped your educationNow you can tackle partisan state gerrymandering or Presidential pardons as a obstruction of justice toolThe start of a very long charge sheet indeedFBI might not hire any person nerdy enough to firewall However as I see it the onus is on flabby nerdy And no I do not have six-pack absolutely-s I imagine is all Everybody is hacked or whatever Axiom of Choice is saying no Not everybody is getting hackedIts not clear that it is a firewall hack issue since the data was taken over the API Its more of a vetting and policy issue how much access to allow between vetted members Vetting becomes progressively harder as criminal technology advances even if someone applies in person how to know that the ID they present isnt fake along with the stolen credentials they are assumingAs a former member of InfraGard back when I applied we had to physically show up at an orientation meeting at the local FBI field office and were vettedhad our accounts created on site My membership lapsed when I moved employers but clearly they relaxed their standardsdue diligence Its sad to see this happen to an organization that is supposed to be security focused above all else This news makes me feel a little bit embarrassed to have ever been associated with the programThe API shouldnt be wide open for any user to query as they pleaseIts not because you must be a vetted memberand vetting makes it super secureVetting zooROFLSo the people who continue to target anyone who does not agree with the mainstream media comments cant even protect their own DatbaseIm just donethe fBI gets BILLIONS and they cant even protect something as simpleas an online DatabaseJust WowI know youre upset that they investigated your favorites California congressman TJ Cox and Texas Rep Henry Cuellar but investigations target those who ask to be investigated by their actionsYup just like Rev Dr Martin Luther King right I have no opinion on the folks you mentioned for the record Hell I dont even know who they are Just pointing out that the idea youre promoting is simplistic and quite frankly dangerous Blind trust in anything especially government is foolishThose guys arent MLK The comparison is insultingIll go further kind sirIn this libertarian US economy blind trust in the private sector and particularly anything connected to electronic commerce is equally dangerous for a US ConsumerHave you not heard of truly massive private data bases breaches and fraud since 2000I wish thee much good luckWith scammers like these Im always surprised they dont get an English-language editor involved to touch up their phishing emails I know theres the whole people who ignore the typosbad grammar are more likely to fall for further scams aspect but as the blog post mentions these targets are already security-conscious people The message in the article above is likely to get no hits while even some basic editing could really clean it up and boost its chancesThat was my first thought too The letter is supposed to be from a CEO Did its author really think anyone who writes like that would be CEO of anything larger than a corner vape shop The letter is a surefire way to eliminate worthless executives anyone who falls for the letter doesnt belong in their jobChatGPT has entered the chatLOL exactlyHave you seen the CEOs of some companies Sam Bankman-Fried and so many others become celebrity executivesTotally read this the first time through that the US Department of Defense was hacking the FBI Funny how in these bizarre times my brain thought yupthat sounds about rightThe FBI is certainly not what they once wereDont know You could be reasonably certain if you passed information from the CIA to the FBI it would get leakedWould the information be used anyway Sort of like providing information to the government prior to the piles of dead bodies But then again can they be sure the information is any good without a few dead bodies And they do not give out medals they say I stopped these with a little dead body underneath Though you can make your own little award and pop it on your deskYesalong with a whole lot other of intel especially if there is gas to be got and oil to be shippedThink of the economic cost for Gods sake or losing all that election financing And the short term political gain in ignoring a whole lot of trouble that likely cant be solved anywayGood God man what you are proposing would turn the whole system on its head We gave all that information to the FBI about the Russians and that sat on that for decadesWhat was it you were saying againYou know that look Batman has on his face when Catwoman told him something but he never listened to itBolton Comey Clinton all had that lookThats better than a cup of coffee Ive had big issues with the infragard and its funny that theyve finally got slapped with KarmaFBI should have to buy it backArent these the guys who want back doors into everything Sure they can be trusted with itInteresting story Just wondering if the major US financial corporation that has a direct impact on the creditworthiness of most Americans is one of the three major credit bureaus That possibility tickles my funny bone Not that I delight in the CEOs misfortune of being impersonated especially for nefarious purposes but might it be an instance of poetic justice that the shoe is on the other footThats a bingoNot a security professional but it seems kind of naive to just accept USDod said as an indicator of truth Particularly one who has claimed to have spoofed the FBI Where is the indicator they have this data and arent spoofing you tooYou mean apart from the fact that I verified they were able to direct message InfraGard members via the InfraGard site with the fake CEO identity they claimed Or the fact that the FBI confirmed they were investigating a rogue accountNot a security professional but I wouldnt terminate that account either if I could monitor to collect other data on its origin from someone dumb enough to keep logging back in Heres another thought the FBI did reach out by phone to the person who didnt apply as the hacker states she feared to confirm it was a penetration attempt but then approved the account early to see where it would go It doesnt sound like a lot of value was obtained in any event a list of subscribers with most of the other data fields left blank even assuming USDoDs claim of what it downloaded is trueWhat is astonishing is the lack of due diligence for site membership If the premise of the site is to share information and communicate among others then identity verification is criticalnothing onlineis privatesomeonesomewherehas all your infoits a game called buy and sellI just double-checked my email I havent received any notification from Infragard or the FBI that my information was exposed Doesnt this mean they are violating the breach notification standardsSame a little let down I found out in my Teams chat last night via a Krebs article Grateful but still youd think theyd say SOMETHING and then back away saying ongoing I did email and the response I got was the canned oneThe FBI is aware of a potential false account associated with the InfraGard Portal and is actively looking into this matter This is an ongoing situation and we are not able to provide additional information at this timeFederal agencies often arent bound by state lawFwiw Californias law is explicitly limited to businesses and state agenciesFun trivia USPS vehicles arent required to have and dont have license plates USPS is a constitutional entityKrebs broke the storySusSo have they locked the site up Ive been trying to log in since last night and cant get in curious how much of myself I put out there and not really too concerned about it all of our intense work is done in person and not online thereThe internet is not secure Never was and never will be But it is forever An expose on the shoddy security of the infraguardorg website was published on LinkedIn on 24 Nov 2019 Title Do as I say not as I do INFRAGUARDORG The author saw this breech coming over 2 years ago and like Cassandra the warning was ignored The author published an number of exposes of insecure organizations including gov mil and org where the organizations are government backed Most were ignored by the entities owning the domainsUSDoD was joking when he said he took it down he actually released the full dataset for free on the 17th or 18th albeit behind an 8 credit wall I dont know why no one is talking about this Forum thread title as proof InfraGard Database Leaked DownloadI dont mean to spam just posting again because Im not sure if comment is held for review or error posting Just in case here is redundant commentUSDoD was joking when he said he took it down he actually released the full dataset for free on the 17th or 18th albeit behind an 8 credit wall I dont know why no one is talking about this Forum thread title as proof InfraGard Database Leaked Download Think about itThe problem with Infragard is not security It is the existence of Infragard In a democratic country do we really want the FBI running a social media siteJust what is social mediaInfragard is Twitter with the FBI cutting out the middlemanThink about itThe problem with Infragard is not security It is the existence of Infragard In a democratic country do we really want the FBI running a social media siteJust what is social mediaInfragard is Twitter with the FBI cutting out the middlemanMuch of what other posters have to say about InfraGard is true but if you subtract the snark these things are true about all human endeavors None of us always operates at the level to which we aspire though we hope that in an emergency well be able And yet we demand that others are at their most capable at all times especially in retrospect InfraGard is neither a program for FBI spying on business or a Social Media operation At its most useful it is a networking group that helps folks to climb out of their silos We have all heard the phrase If you see something say something InfraGard facilitates the

        "text": "Powered byATT Alien LabsCybersecurity is a relatively new discipline in the realm of computing Once computing became more democratized with PCs connected via local area networks LAN and clientserver environments adversaries quickly saw opportunities The more democratized computing the more risk and the potential for cyber adversariesDealing with cyber risk and adversaries is now part of a normal business plan Gone are the days of instilling fear uncertainty and doubt FUD about the potential of a bad actor The days of nefarious hackers in hoodies lurking in the shadows are goneBusinesses of all types and sizes now know that cybersecurity is part of a solid business plan Security is no longer relegated to a team of really smart experts security is a business enabler and builder of digital trustWith more of a focus on outcomes security becomes the center of focus in the new democratized era of computing We are just getting started with ideas for edge computing And by association we are just getting started with what security meansHere are my predictions for some of the trends and highlights we will see in cybersecurity landscape in the year aheadA new paradigm of computing is upon us This new era is underpinned by 5G and edgeEdge is a word we have heard for quite some time but in general conversation lacks a consistent definition Vendors and business users alike tend to define edge in accordance with the technology stack being sold or usedWhen thinking about edge consider these three characteristics as a starting pointEdge use cases are largely driven by the world of the internet of things IoT that collect and transmit data to make logical and rational decisions to derive an outcomeIn 2023 we should expect to see an accelerated full-scale rollout of edge use cases in areas such asThese use cases require connected systems from the network layer through to application monitoringmanagement and require each component to be secure in order to derive the desired outcomeWith more democratized computing security is no longer isolated it is central to delivering strong business outcomesIn 2023 expect to see more edge use cases and applications For successful implementation and with security at the core expect to see the erosion of decades-old siloes such as networking IT app development and security begin to fade away and enable more cross-functional work and rolesNetworks are becoming more intelligent The idea of disaggregation the separation into component parts means that some security tools may be able to become part of the networkFollowing the theme of software-defined disaggregated networks can bring in the security components needed at a specific time Think about a network infected with malware In the scenario of a disaggregated network a new instantiation may be easily and quickly spun up and the propagation of malware across the network avoidedAdmittedly widespread implementation and adoption of disaggregation will take more than the next 12 months However expect to see the start of this game-changing technology in 2023Edge computing is all about data collecting using and enrichingFrom a security perspective expect to see solutions that focus on the data lifecycle to help organizations make sure that data governance policies are automated and enforcedAs more edge applications are deployed the sheer amount of data will multiply at a rapid scale Data at the heart of the edge app needs to be protected intacttrusted and usable It is critical to make sure the data lifecycle is managed with the proper data governance policiesIn 2023 expect to have more emphasis and focus placed on data the collection management use and governanceSecurity is central to a successful business and in a software-defined world applications or apps are the connecting pointAPIs and applets are about computer program to computer program communication It is critical that the software development lifecycle SDLC embrace security as a non-functional requirement This need may require developers to re-assess software engineering practices and work in more systematic waysIn 2023 expect application security to be a top priority as organizations move to the edge and understand the importance of security as a central priority for the business including at the application levelThreat intelligence the gathering of information about attacks on an organization from a variety of sources will continue to be an essential component of securityWith edge computing and the expansion of IoT devices threat intelligence will relay more granular and refined information about the attack surface Threat intelligence will continue to be delivered as tactical strategic and operational As more machine learning enrichment is available consumers of threat intelligence will demand more pertinent and personalized reportingIn 2023 expect to see the need for more relevant and curated threat intelligence feeds designed to combat specific industries or use casesUsing biometrics to authenticate identity is nothing new we have been doing this with fingerprints for over 50 years and more recently with facial recognition In fact multi-factor authentication MFA is frequently framed as something you know a passcode something you have a device and something you are a biometric indicatorWe are now seeing celebrities selling their images or digital twins This means that your favorite actor will continue to be in new movies at varying ages indefinitelyWhat does this mean for security Increasingly we are being asked to authenticate via some sort of biometric Advancements in digital twins and deepfakes mean there is a need to secure our own physical identities The abundance of images available of any individual via a quick internet search can yield a treasure trove for an adversary seeking to hack an identityIn 2023 expect to see more serious discussions regarding digital twins and how to make biometrics more secureCybersecurity professionals have secured our cyber world the electronic bits and bytes that create our computing systems Increasingly connected computers are entering a space that was reserved for physical only devices think internet connected medical devices internet connected construction devices and internet connected transportation such as cars planes and ships These previously physical only devices connected to the internet now constitute convergenceAnything connected to the internet has to be secured and this includes newly converged physical devices that are now considered endpointsMaking sure that these new style of endpoints are protected from cyber-attacks as well as physical attacks are keyIn 2023 expect to see more solutions focused on protecting the cyber and the physical and expect to see new roles emerge in organizations focused on this new element of securityDisruption is essential for innovation As new born on the edge companies begin to emerge the baggage of previous iterations of computing are jettisoned Just as we saw born of the web companies not have to deal with legacy computing systems and infrastructure born on the edge

        "text": "These incidents should serve as a warning to revisit third-party vendor relationships ensure the entity is at least annually performing a review of vendors and consider consolidating vendors where possible In calculating this list SC Media listed the pixel incidents as single events because the tools were not caused directly by the vendor Indeed the pixels operated as intended The incidents were instead caused by the providers failing to consider possible privacy implications of using tracking tools on patient-facing sites and The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance requirementsIn a strong example despite its systems being down across dozens of its care sites for more than a month the CommonSpirit ransomware attack only resulted in data theft at seven hospitals and for 623774 patients However the patient care impacts are simply not as easy to calculateSC Media will delve into patient safety impacts from this year in the near-future as the lessons learned from these outages warrant a separate lookWith over 326278 impacted patients Aetna ACE was among the hardest hit by the third-party incidentThe OTP notice disclosed that a threat actor accessed several servers one day before deploying the ransomware payload The vendor was unable to determine just what files were accessed during the dwell time and instead reported based on the data contained within the servers like patient names member IDs and information gathered from health assessmentsOnly one of the affected health plans saw SSNs compromised during the incidentIn what is undoubtedly the most complex and headline-grabbing stories in healthcare this year Eye Care Leaders reported ransomware attack and the drama that followed is the second-largest breach reported this yearIn a surprising twist ECL began to report in May that it was indeed hit with a ransomware attack except the incident was not related to the outages reported in the lawsuit Summit Eye Associates and EvergreenHealth were the first to report on the incident caused by the deployment of ransomware on Dec 4 2021The attacker first gained access to the systems weeks before the cyberattack using their access to databases to delete data and system configuration files The evidence could not rule out access to provider data which included patient names Social Security numbers dates of birth medical record numbers health insurance and treatment information Other provider notices showed greater or lesser data impactsWhile the initial lawsuit against ECL has since been joined by patient-led lawsuits filed in the wake of the public reports there is still a lot the public does not know about the 2021 incidents at ECL Whats clear is that ECL failed to notify providers impacted by the December 2021 incident until at least 30 days after the HIPAA-required timeframeReported in late October Advocate Aurora informed patients that their health information was shared with Google and Facebook as a result of its use of Pixel on its patient portals websites applications and scheduling tools Pixel was used by Advocate Aurora to better understand how patients were interacting with these sitesHowever the tech also disclosed protected health information as well as certain details about interactions with our websites particularly for users that are concurrently logged into their Google or Facebook accounts and have shared their identity and other surfing habits with these companies officials explainedThe pixels have since been removed or disabled but not before the accidental disclosure of patients IP addresses appointment dates times andor locations proximity to Advocate Aurora Health locations provider details procedure types communications between the patient and others on the MyChart platform insurance information and proxy namesConnexin first discovered a data anomaly back on Aug 26 Two weeks later they discovered an actor accessed an offline set of patient data used for data conversion and troubleshooting and removed it from the networkThe stolen data varied by individual and could involve names contact details SSNs guarantor names parent or guardian names dates of birth highly specific health insurance information treatments procedures diagnoses prescriptions provider names medical record numbers and billing andor claims dataConnexin stressed that its live EMR system wasnt hacked during the incident nor were any systems EMRs or databases belonging to physician practice groups But notably absent from its notice was the cause behind the lengthy delay in notifying patients and their familiesTwo million patients tied to 60 healthcare providers were told their data was compromised and likely stolen during a two-week hack from March 7 to March 21 but was not discovered by Shields until March 28Although Shields identified and investigated a security alert on or around March 18 data theft was not confirmed at that time according to the notice The subsequent investigation confirmed the actors stole a range of data that included SSNs medical record numbers patient IDs treatment information insurance details billing information and diagnoses among other dataThe incident forced Shields to rebuild the entirety of the affected systems The notice did not explain why it issued its notices far outside the required 60-day HIPAA timeframeWhats more the attack was found and stopped on the same day it occurred Even with only a short amount of dwell time the attack was able to access patient names SSNs contact details accounts receivable balances payment information dates of birth insurance information and medical treatmentsThe incident forced PFC to wipe and rebuild the entirety of the systems impacted by the incidentOn April 20 the security detected malicious code installed on certain systems which was later found to have provided attackers with the ability to remove patient data from the network The stolen data varied by patient and may have included demographic details SSNs insurance data diagnoses treatments reason for visit claims data and a host of other informationIn fact CHN only launched its investigation after learning about the alleged pixel data scraping Their investigation soon confirmed the installed pixels had collected and disclosed user data to the tech giants CHN has since removed or disabled the pixels from its impacted platformsThe unauthorized disclosure varied by patient and depended on how the configuration of the users devices and activities on the CHN website The more a user interacted with the site the greater the disclosure The data could include IP addresses appointment details provider names portal communications appointment or procedure types and other sensitive dataThe breach notice was sent just weeks after the June investigative reports on the Meta Pixel tracking tool in an effort to be as transparent as possible It remains unclear whether the reports prompted the discovery of the data scraping or if it was an internal investigationCalling it an incorrect misconfiguration the use of Pixel led to Meta receiving patients demographic details contact information emergency contacts or advanced care planning appointment types and date provider names button or menu selections andor content typed into free text boxes The data varied by individualThe threat actor remained on the network for four days and exfiltrated a wide range of patient and employee information from the network including SSNs financial or bank account information medical histories conditions treatments diagnoses medical record numbers and drivers licenses among other sensitive dataLike several other providers this year the notice fell outside the 60-day HIPAA requirement But Broward Health informed individuals the delay was directly caused by a Department of Justice request to hold the breach notice to prevent compromising the ongoing law enforcement investigationSeveral lawsuits were filed against Broward Health in the wake of the patient notifications some of which have been dismissedUpdate SC Media inadvertently referred to the initial data estimates for the OTP

        "title": "IIS modules The evolution of web shells and how to detect them Microsoft Security Blog",
        "text": "Web exploitation and web shells are some of the most common entry points in the current threat landscape Web servers provide an external avenue directly into your corporate network which often results in web servers being an initial intrusion vector or mechanism of persistence Monitoring for exploitation and web shells should be a high priority for all networks and while these detection techniques are targeted towards malicious IIS modules a lot of these techniques will also provide general web shell detectionsThe concept of malicious IIS has been around since at least 2013 Historical malware analysis shows how crimeware groups used IIS modules to intercept client logons and payment details by using the BeginRequest triggers to read user-provided parameters before the webserver processes themA core part of IIS module functionality is event handling Event triggers provide opportunities for code to be called when specific actions happen IIS modules have access to 27 event triggers by default includingEvent handlers which run when their associated trigger is fired can allow an actor to essentially setup a proxy on the IIS server By setting up an event handler on the BeginRequest EndRequest and Error event triggers the actor can intercept all requests before the web service can process them and before the response is sent to the clientEvent handlers are given full read and write access to the requests which allows malicious IIS modules to hide web shell communications within any aspect on the web request turning every page that does and does not exist into a web shell This can include hiding web shell communications in the parameters body headers or HTTP methodsThese aspects of malicious IIS modules make them very hard to detect in standard IIS logs You cannot rely on usual web shell detection strategies such as high frequency page requests or URI patterns Malicious IIS modules instead require new detection techniques and use of advanced IIS loggingAn additional difficulty with malicious IIS modules is that they can tamper with any aspect of the request andor response This could include removing web shell commands from parameters or headers and preventing web shell commands from being loggedIIS Modules can also intercept responses before they are sent which presents the opportunity for an actor to serve malicious payloads into any response from the website potentially infecting viewers of the websiteW3wpexe also known as IIS worker processes is utilized by web applications that run within IIS Process creation is the most common indication of a web shell on IIS servers Monitoring for the creation of common shell tooling cmd PowerShell rundll32 mshta with the parent process w3wpexe can help detect low-sophistication IIS modulesThis should not be considered a strong detection for IIS modules With full integration with C and the NET framework a large amount of functionality can be integrated to execute directly within the IIS process without relying on creating child processesAs mentioned in the vendor paper earlier assemblies can be provided arbitrarily to deliver additional functionality This may be through providing the assembly through the web request or downloading the assembly from an actor-controlled C2 The figure below showsWith access to NET malicious actors can add additional layers of evasion to prevent detection of their IIS modules such as encoding or encryption In the figure below we can seeIIS logs are a great place to start hunting for web shells but advanced IIS logging is recommended because IIS modules can remove malicious traffic from the standard IIS logs The IIS Service can provide additional advanced logging such as the Microsoft IIS Configuration Operational log which can be enabled through the event log tool by using the following commandsThe log that we will be focusing on in this blog is the Microsoft IIS Configuration Operational log When enabled the default path for this log is CWindowsSystem32winevtLogsMicrosoft-IIS-Configuration4Operationalevtx shown in the figure aboveThe Microsoft IIS Configuration Operational log captures the additional and removal of IIS modules Event ID 29 IIS modules are not commonly added to a production IIS server so alerting on this event ID should be enabled within your SIEM or security productsNote This IIS module has no correlation with the Exchange Vulnerability ProxyShellModules listed through appcmd will be ordered based on the order of installation In Figure 9 the two malicious IIS modules ProxyShell and Malicious IIS Module were the two most recent IIS modules installed and therefore the last two on the list The type parameter also shows the class that is called when the module is loadedThe webconfig file which details the settings for a website can include modules that the website loads and should therefore be monitored when detecting malicious IIS modules Monitoring of webconfig should primarily focus on tracking modifications to the file and can be done through multiple tools and sources For example the Microsoft IIS Configuration Operational event log produces Event ID 50 when a modification is made to a website Because the content of the modification is not captured a backup of the webconfig should be stored for easy comparison between the modified file and the originalMost EDRs capture file modification events as well Enabling an alert for the modification of webconfig especially from the w3wpexe process will enable detection of unwarranted changes to the configWhile loaded IIS modules are standardly loaded DLLs not all tools list NET modules that are loaded into w3wpexe One tool that does show IIS modules loaded into w3wpexe is Process Hacker which if used with administrative privileges will show them under the Modules tabIn Microsoft Defender for Endpoint an IIS module that is loaded into w3wpexe will appear twice First when loaded from the bin directory from which it resides then immediately after from the temporary ASPNET directoryBy default IIS modules are loaded when the w3wpexe process is created If an IIS module is loaded while the w3wpexe process is already executing and at a different time than the rest of the module it can be an indicator for malicious IIS module loading Monitoring for abnormal module loads may help detect malicious IIS modules Using a query like the KQL one below can group together modules loaded into w3wpexe at the same second In Figure 12 we can see a large number of modules being loaded within a three second time period followed by the malicious ProxyShell IIS module three hours laterWhile IIS modules have the capability to load NET modules arbitrarily and reflectively within the context of w3wpexe the AppDomains are still registered within the hosting process By listing AppDomain loaded within an assembly through a tool like Process Hacker youll be able to find the loaded IIS module and any NET modules that have been loadedIn the figure above the malicious IIS module ProxyShell can be seen alongside the loaded assemblies SharpHound and SweetPotato Another thing to note is that reflectively loaded modules usually do not have Flags in Figure 13 all the assemblies without Flags are either loaded through the malicious IIS module or through Visual Studio debuggingThe ETW provider Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntimeRundown provides a snapshot in time of the loaded NET modules within active processes Two events can help detect malicious assemblies loaded within IISThe ModuleILPath field shows the path of the loaded assembly however if this assembly is loaded reflectively rather than a path to the file it will instead just list the name of the assembly The figure below shows how SharpHound and SweetPotato both with reflectively loaded assemblies do not have paths while other events doThe Assembly Flags field may also be 0 similar to Figure 13 where Process Hacker shows empty Flags for the assembliesProcesses which contain appcmd or gacutil within the command line and the parent process w3wpexe should be investigated for potential installation of malicious IIS modules The following Defender for Endpoint queries can help detect such malicious IIS module installationProcess creation events with the parent process of w3wpexe should be monitored for abnormal child processes For IIS servers that require child processes of w3wpexe ignore lists should be created for these child processes to prevent false flagsIf one of the Potato-sploits are being used to create processes the AccountName field may also be System while the InitiatingProcessAccountName will be the Application PoolThreat actors use a variety of techniques to conceal their activity when using malicious IIS modules Enabling additional logging in your environment is recommended to facilitate the detection of these harmful modules Specifically IIS servers should enable the optional event log Microsoft IIS Configuration Operational This log can provide insight into IIS modules being added or removed from the IIS server and track any modifications made to webconfigIIS Servers should have their webconfig and IIS modules monitored for malicious modifications being made For example Gacutilexe and appcmdexe being executed from w3wpexe should be monitored for potential installation of IIS modules Additionally the bin directories of websites and the default GAC path should be monitored and regularly scanned for malicious modules being createdHunting for malicious IIS modules can be performed through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or your EDR of choice and it should be conducted regularly to detect abnormal w3wpexe interactions This can include but is not limited to process creation file creation and named pipe creation Due to the wide flexibility around how IIS modules can execute malicious code its important to look for irregularities in behaviorDetecting web exploitation and malicious IIS modules should be a priority for all organizations and Microsoft DART believes that following the recommendations provided in this blog and along with the monitoring and detection strategies will assist your organization in the detection and response of these threatsMicrosoft is a leader in cybersecurity and we embrace our responsibility to make the world a safer

        "text": "Apple announced several new security features designed to better protect users from an array of emerging threatsOn Wednesday the tech giant unveiled three new features iMessage Contact Key Verification Security Keys for Apple ID and Advanced Data Protection for iCloudThe new features for iMessage will allow users to verify that they are only sending messages to the intended person and the Apple ID tool will give customers the chance to mandate that a physical security key is needed to sign into their Apple ID accountAdvanced Data Protection for iCloud will allow users to deploy end-to-end encryption on iCloud data including iCloud Backup Photos Notes and moreApple is committed to strengthening both device and cloud security and to adding new protections over timeAdvanced Data Protection for iCloud is available in the US now for members of the Apple Beta Software Program and will be available to all US based users by the end of the year The feature will roll out for the rest of the world in early 2023iMessage Contact Key Verification and Security Keys for Apple ID will both be available globally at some point in 2023The study notes that the total number of data breaches more than tripled between 2013 and 2021 exposing 11 billion personal records across the globe in 2021Apple said that while the iMessage Contact Key Verification is available to everyone it is targeted at users who face extraordinary digital threats such as journalists human rights activists and members of governmentThe feature gives a second level of verification that they are messaging only with the people they intend While Apple noted that the vast majority of people will never be targeted by highly sophisticated cyberattacks the tool is an extra layer of security for those who may beConversations between users who have enabled iMessage Contact Key Verification receive automatic alerts if an exceptionally advanced adversary such as a state-sponsored attacker were ever to succeed breaching cloud servers and inserting their own device to eavesdrop on these encrypted communications Apple explainedAnd for even higher security iMessage Contact Key Verification users can compare a Contact Verification Code in person on FaceTime or through another secure callSecurity Keys for Apple ID was designed for more high-profile users who face concerted threats to their online accounts such as celebrities journalists and members of governmentMore than 95 of active iCloud accounts already have two-factor authentication but the security keys offer people another layer of protection requiring a hardware security key as one of the two factorsThe feature was built to withstand phishing scams preventing anyone from obtaining a persons second factorIvan Krsti Apples head of Security Engineering and Architecture said Advanced Data Protection is Apples highest level of cloud data security and gives users the choice to protect the vast majority of their most sensitive iCloud data with end-to-end encryption so that it can only be decrypted on their trusted devicesFor those who opt in Advanced Data Protection keeps most iCloud data protected even in the case of a data breach in the cloud according to Apple The platform already uses end-to-end encryption by default for 14 data categories like passwords and health data But the new program expands the feature to 23 data categories including iCloud Backup Notes and PhotosThe only major iCloud data categories that are not covered are iCloud Mail Contacts and Calendar because of the need to interoperate with the global email contacts and calendar systems Apple saidWe constantly identify and mitigate emerging threats to their personal data on device and in the cloud said Craig Federighi Apples senior vice president of Software EngineeringOur security teams work tirelessly to keep users data safe and with iMessage Contact Key Verification Security Keys and Advanced Data Protection for iCloud users will have three powerful new tools to further protect their most sensitive data and communicationsApple cited the repeated abuse of this tool to breach and spy on innocent victims by oppressive regimesResearchers and journalists have publicly documented a history of this spyware being abused to target journalists activists dissidents academics and government officials the company saidTanium's Melissa Bischoping called the changes a step forward in meeting industry best-practices for modern security and privacy and explained that keep iMessage and iCloud competitive with other privacy-focused messaging solutionsThe Apple userbase is vast and while these protections are of key interest to those in sensitive positions like activists journalists and politicalgovernment employees the benefits are also valuable as regular consumers continue to see their data stolen she said UPDATE The FBI told reporters from the Wall Street Journal that it opposed several of the changes announced by AppleThe FBI said it continues to be deeply concerned with the threat end-to-end and user-only-access encryption poseThis hinders our ability to protect the American people from criminal acts ranging from cyber-attacks and violence against children to drug trafficking organized crime and terrorism the FBI saidEnd-to-end and user-only-access encryption erodes law enforcement's ability to combat these threats and administer justice for the American publicThe FBI went on to claim that it needs lawful access by design in order to conduct investigations Jonathan Greig is a

intrusion set active since at least April 2017 Although it was not publicly attributed to any Russian intelligence service past Calisto operations showed objectives and victimology that align closely with Russian strategic interestsWhile Security Service of Ukraine SBU publicly associated Calisto with Gamaredon Group an intrusion set attributed to the Russian Federal Security Service FSB that focuses essentially on Ukraine operations since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022 this link is not supported by other security companies or researchers SEKOIAIO conducted further technical investigations but did not nd any overlap between Calisto and Gamaredon activitiesBased on SEKOIAIO EvilNgix trackers we came across domains known to us as aligning with past Calisto activities Further investigations led to a larger infrastructure composed of more than 80 domains including domains typosquatting entitesIn past observed campaigns Calisto operators sent malicious PDF attachments to their victims The rst page of the PDF mimics an error in the PDF renderer engine inciting the victim to open a link leading to a malicious web page This webpage aims at gathering the victims credentials by using EvilGinx Here are a few examples of PDF retrieved in this investigationThe last pages of the documents contain blobs of spirals and text as shown below SEKOIAIO analysts still dont know why such gibberish is used as it appears useless as an anti-detection trick However the idea to put the phishing link in a PDF instead of in the email body prevents link analysis from email gateways and is a good tactic to remain undetected from an attacker point of viewSEKOIAIO conducted open-source research on the typosquatted domains to identify targets As we redact this paper we found six private companies based in the US and Eastern Europe and four Non-governmental organizations NGOs all involved in Ukraine support SEKOIAIO contacted the NGOs to get the phishing email or payloadOne of them shared the email exchange between the victim and the attacker using aspoofed email from a trusted source including the malicious PDF payload a technique previously observed in Calisto campaigns The email exchange shows that the attacker did not include the malicious payload in the rst email but waited to get an answer to build a relationship and avoid suspicion before sending the payload to the victim That Calisto social engineering technique was already observed by MicrosoftMost of the targeted private organizations are involved in military equipment military logistics or humanitarian support for Ukraine including a US company that provides humanitarian logistics and possibly tactical equipment to Kiev Other sectors include communication technologies and cybersecurity medium condence Additional potential victims include NGOs and think tanks involved in conict resolution and war crime investigation including an organization also involved in the Syrian civil war crime investigation and previously targeted by an Indian hack-for-hire company in June 2020 Most of the NGOs and think tanks targeted are publicly supporting UkraineSEKOIAIO notes that the observed victimology through the investigation matches known Calisto victimology namely strategic research civil society and military equipment sectors as well as entities and individuals involved in Russian mattersAmong discovered Calisto malicious domains three caught SEKOIAIO analysts attention mvd-redirru and dns-mvdru high condence that are highly likely typosquatting the Russian Ministry of Interior and lk-nalog-govru low condence the Russian Federal Taxation Service Based on the fact that Calisto was observed targeting Russian individuals abroad SEKOIAIO assess it is plausible that Calisto conducts domestic surveillance as well Another less plausible hypothesis would be a false-ag maneuver to raise doubts on the infrastructures attributionDespite the absence of technical evidence associating Calisto activities with a known Russian cyber offensive service Sekoiaio assess that this intrusion set intelligence collection activities targeting parties involved in Ukraine

        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather DEV-0139 is now tracked as Citrine SleetWe are also seeing more complex attacks wherein the threat actor shows great knowledge and preparation taking steps to gain their targets trust before deploying payloads For example Microsoft recently investigated an attack where the threat actor tracked as DEV-0139 took advantage of Telegram chat groups to target cryptocurrency investment companies DEV-0139 joined Telegram groups used to facilitate communication between VIP clients and cryptocurrency exchange platforms and identified their target from among the members The threat actor posed as representatives of another cryptocurrency investment company and in October 2022 invited the target to a different chat group and pretended to ask for feedback on the fee structure used by cryptocurrency exchange platforms The threat actor had a broader knowledge of this specific part of the industry indicating that they were well prepared and aware of the current challenge the targeted companies may haveAfter gaining the targets trust DEV-0139 then sent a weaponized Excel file with the name OKX Binance Huobi VIP fee comparisionxls which contained several tables about fee structures among cryptocurrency exchange companies The data in the document was likely accurate to increase their credibility This weaponized Excel file initiates the following series of activitiesFurther investigation through our telemetry led to the discovery of another file that uses the same DLL proxying technique But instead of a malicious Excel file it is delivered in an MSI package for a CryptoDashboardV2 application dated June 2022 This may suggest other related campaigns are also run by the same threat actor using the same techniquesAs with any observed nation state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts Microsoft uses DEV- designations as a temporary name given to an unknown emerging or a developing cluster of threat activity allowing Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center MSTIC to track it as a unique set of information until we reach a high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity Once it meets the criteria a DEV is converted to a named actorTo identify the targets the threat actor sought out members of cryptocurrency investment groups on Telegram In the specific attack DEV-0139 got in touch with their target on October 19 2022 by creating a secondary Telegram group with the name NameOfTheTargetedCompany OKX Fee Adjustment and inviting three employees The threat actor created fake profiles using details from employees of the company OKX The screenshot below shows the real accounts and the malicious ones for two of the users present in the groupIts worth noting that the threat actor appears to have a broad knowledge of the cryptocurrency industry and the challenges the targeted company may face The threat actor asked questions about fee structures which are the fees used by crypto exchange platforms for trading The fees are a big challenge for investment funds as they represent a cost and must be optimized to minimize impact on margin and profits Like many other companies in this industry the largest costs come from fees charged by exchanges This is a very specific topic that demonstrates how the threat actor was advanced and well prepared before contacting their targetAfter gaining the trust of the target the threat actor sent a weaponized Excel document to the target containing further details on the fees to appear legitimate The threat actor used the fee structure discussion as an opportunity to ask the target to open the weaponized Excel file and fill in their informationThe weaponized Excel file which has the file name OKX Binance Huobi VIP fee comparisionxls Sha256 abca3253c003af67113f83df2242a7078d5224870b619489015e4fde060acad0 is well crafted and contains legitimate information about the current fees used by some crypto exchanges The metadata extracted showed that the file was created by the user WolfThe macro is obfuscated and abuses UserForm a feature used to create windows to store data and variables In this case the name of the UserForm is IFUZYDTTOP and the macro retrieves the information with the following code IFUZYDTTOPMgQnQVGbCaption where MgQnQVGb is the name of the label in the UserForm and caption allows to retrieve the information stored into the UserFormThe table below shows the data retrieved from the UserFormThe macro retrieves some parameters from the UserForm as well as another XLS file stored in base64 The XLS file is dropped into the directory CProgramDataMicrosoft Media as VSDB688tmp and runs in invisible modeAdditionally the main sheet in the Excel file is protected with the password dragon to encourage the target to enable the macros The sheet is then unprotected after installing and running the other Excel file stored in Base64 This is likely used to trick the user to enable macros and not raise suspicionThe second Excel file VSDB688tmp Sha256 a2d3c41e6812044573a939a51a22d659ec32aea00c26c1a2fdf7466f5c7e1ee9 is used to retrieve a PNG file that is parsed later by the macro to extract two executable files and the encrypted backdoor Below is the metadata for the second worksheetThe table below shows the deobfuscated data retrieved from the UserFormThe macro retrieves some parameters from the UserForm then downloads a PNG file from hxxpsodlkdd021d412be456a6f78a0052a1f0e3557dcfa14bf25f9d0f1d0d2d7dcdac86c73Backgroundpng The file was no longer available at the time of analysis indicating that the threat actor likely deployed it only for this specific attackThe PNG is then split into three parts and written in three different files the legitimate file logagentexe a malicious version of wsock32dll and the XOR encrypted backdoor with the GUID 56762eb9-411c-4842-9530-9922c46ba2da The three files are used to load the main payload to the target systemTwo of the three files extracted from the PNG file logagentexe and wsock32dll are used to load the XOR encrypted backdoor The following sections present our in-depth analysis of both filesLogagentexe Hash 8400f2674892cdfff27b0dfe98a2a77673ce5e76b06438ac6110f0d768459942 is a legitimate system application used to log errors from Windows Media Player and send the information for troubleshootingThe file contains the following metadata but it is not signedThe logagentexe imports function from the wsock32dll which is abused by the threat actor to load malicious code into the targeted system To trigger and run the malicious wsock32dll logagentexe is run with the following arguments previously retrieved by the macro 56762eb9-411c-4842-9530-9922c46ba2da shadow Both arguments are then retrieved by wsock32dll The GUID 56762eb9-411c-4842-9530-9922c46ba2da is the filename for the malicious wsock32dll to load and shadow is used as an XOR key to decrypt it Both parameters are needed for the malware to function potentially hindering isolated analysisThe legitimate wsock32dll is the Windows Socket API used by applications to handle network connections In this attack the threat actor used a malicious version of wsock32dll to evade detection The malicious wsock32dll is loaded by logagentexe through DLL side-loading and uses DLL proxying to call the legitimate functions from the real wsock32dll and avoid detection DLL proxying is a hijacking technique where a malicious DLL sits in between the application calling the exported function and a legitimate DLL that implements that exported function In this attack the malicious wsock32dll acts as a proxy between logagentexe and the legitimate wsock32dllIt is possible to notice that the DLL is forwarding the call to the legitimate functions by looking at the import address tableWhen the malicious wsock32dll is loaded it first retrieves the command line and checks if the file with the GUID as a filename is present in the same directory using the CreateFile API to retrieve a file handleThe malicious wsock32dll loads and decodes the final implant into the memory with the GUID name which is used to remote access the infected machineOnce the file is loaded into the memory it gives remote access to the threat actor At the time of the analysis we could not retrieve the final payload However we identified another variant of this attack and retrieved the payload which is discussed in the next section Identified implants were connecting back to the same command-and-control C2 serverWe identified another file using a similar mechanism as logagentexe and delivering the same payload The loader is packaged as an MSI package and as posed an application called CryptoDashboardV2 Hash e5980e18319027f0c28cd2f581e75e755a0dace72f10748852ba5f63a0c99487 After installing the MSI it uses a legitimate application called tplinkexe to sideload the malicious DLL called DUserdll and uses DLL proxying as wellOnce the package is installed it runs and side-loads the DLL using the following command CUsersuserAppDataRoamingDashboardv2TPLinkexe 27E57D84-4310-4825-AB22-743C78B8F3AA sven where it noticeably uses a different GUIDFurther analysis of the malicious DUserdll showed that its original name is also HijackingLibdll same as the malicious wsock32dll This could indicate the usage of the same tool to create these malicious DLL proxies Below are the file details of DUserdllOnce the DLL is running it loads and decodes the implant in the memory and starts beaconing the same domain In that case the implant is using the GUID name 27E57D84-4310-4825-AB22-743C78B8F3AA and the XOR key svenThe payload decoded in the memory by the malicious DLL is an implant used by the threat actor to remotely access the compromised machine We were able to get the one from the second variant we uncovered Below are the details of the payloadFirst the sample retrieves some information from the targeted system It can connect back to a remote server and receive commands from itIt is interesting to notice that the threat actor abused OpenDrive in one of the variants to deliver the payload The OpenDrive account has been set up quickly for a one shot indicating that it was created for only one targetWe identified one domain used as C2 server strainservicecom and connected back to the two implants This domain was registered on June 26 on Namecheap just before the distribution of the first variant At the time of the attack the server had port 80 443 and 2083 The implants were communicated on port 443In this report we analyzed a targeted attack on cryptocurrency investment fund startups Such companies are relatively new but manage hundreds of millions of dollars raising interest by threat actors In this attack we identified that the threat actor has broad knowledge of the cryptocurrency industry as well as the challenges their targets may face increasing the sophistication of the attack and their chance of success The threat actor used Telegram an app widely used in the field to identify the profile of interest gained the targets trust by discussing relevant topics and finally sent a weaponized document that delivered a backdoor through multiple mechanisms Additionally the second attack identified was luring a fake crypto dashboard applicationThe cryptocurrency market remains a field of interest for threat actors Targeted users are identified through trusted channels to increase the chance of success While the biggest companies can be targeted smaller companies can also be targets of interest The techniques used by the actor covered in this blog can be mitigated by adopting the security considerations provided belowMicrosoft Defender

Dolphin a sophisticated backdoor extending the arsenal of the ScarCruft APT group30 Nov 2022 14 min readESET researchers have analyzed a previously unreported backdoor used by the ScarCruft APT group The backdoor which we named Dolphin has a wide range of spying capabilities including monitoring drives and portable devices and exfiltrating files of interest keylogging and taking screenshots and stealing credentials from browsers Its functionality is reserved for selected targets to which the backdoor is deployed after initial compromise using less advanced malware In line with other ScarCruft tools Dolphin abuses cloud storage services specifically Google Drive for CC communicationDuring our investigation we saw continued development of the backdoor and attempts by the malware authors to evade detection A notable feature of earlier Dolphin versions we analyzed is the ability to modify the settings of victims signed-in Google and Gmail accounts to lower their security most likely to maintain access to victims email inboxesKey points in this blogpostESET researchers analyzed Dolphin a previously unreported backdoor used by the ScarCruft APT groupDolphin is deployed on selected targets only it searches the drives of compromised systems for interesting files and exfiltrates them to Google DriveThe backdoor was used as the final payload of a multistage attack in early 2021 involving a watering-hole attack on a South Korean online newspaper an Internet Explorer exploit and another ScarCruft backdoor named BLUELIGHTSince the initial discovery of Dolphin in April 2021 ESET researchers have observed multiple versions of the backdoor in which the threat actors improved the backdoors capabilities and made attempts to evade detectionA notable feature of earlier Dolphin versions we analyzed is the ability to modify the settings of victims signed-in Google and Gmail accounts to lower their securityScarCruft also known as APT37 or Reaper is an espionage group that has been operating since at least 2012 It primarily focuses on South Korea but other Asian countries also have been targeted ScarCruft seems to be interested mainly in government and military organizations and companies in various industries linked to the interests of North KoreaIn those reports the BLUELIGHT backdoor was described as the attacks final payload However when analyzing the attack we discovered through ESET telemetry a second more sophisticated backdoor deployed on selected victims via BLUELIGHT We named this backdoor Dolphin based on a PDB path found in the executableWhile the BLUELIGHT backdoor performs basic reconnaissance and evaluation of the compromised machine after exploitation Dolphin is more sophisticated and manually deployed only against selected victims Both backdoors are capable of exfiltrating files from a path specified in a command but Dolphin also actively searches drives and automatically exfiltrates files with extensions of interest to ScarCruftFigure 1 provides an overview of the attack components leading to the execution of the Dolphin backdoorFigure 1 Overview of the attack components leading to the execution of the Dolphin backdoorAnalysis of Dolphins components and their capabilities is provided in the following sectionThe analysis is based on the first version of the backdoor that we found 19 based on a string found in the code with additional information about changes in newer versions A summarized description of the version changes can be found in the Dolphin evolution sectionEnsuing sections describe the installer and loader components responsible for the execution of the Dolphin backdoor in the analyzed attack scenarioIt is worth noting that this installer and the deployed loader are not exclusive to Dolphin and were previously seen used with other ScarCruft malwareThe installer shellcode follows these main objectivesThe installer downloads a CAB file from OneDrive containing a legitimate Python 27 interpreter The CAB is unpacked to APPDATA and depending on architecture the interpreter ends up in one of the following directoriesThe installer generates two file paths for loading-chain components loaderstep1 and loaderencryptedstep2 with the format basedirinfnamedllnamebasedir is randomly selected frominfname and dllname are randomly selected from existing filenames without extension in windirinfinf and windirsystem32dllTo generate Step 1 of Loader it uses a script template that is filled with randomly generated names variables function The template with generated example is shown in Figure 2Figure 2 Step 1 template and generated exampleThe script is then written to loaderstep1Step 2 embedded in the installer containing the rest of the loading chain including the payload is encrypted with a one-byte XOR key derived from the current time and written to loaderencryptedstep2In order to persist the start of the loading chain the installer sets a Run registry valueHKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunrandomrunnameappdataPython273264pythonwexe loaderstep1 loaderencryptedstep2The randomrunname is randomly selected from existing filenames matching WINDIRinfinf discarding the inf extensionTo start the loading chain after installation it creates a one-time scheduled taskThe Dolphin loader consists of a Python script and shellcodeStep 1 the Python script reads a specified file XOR-decrypts its contents and executes the resulting shellcodeStep 2 shellcode creates a host process random CLI executable from WINDIRSystem32exe XOR-decrypts further shellcode carried within itself and injects it into the created processStep 3 another shellcode XOR-decrypts an embedded PE file the Dolphin backdoor and loads and executes it using a custom PE loaderDolphin is a backdoor that collects information and executes commands issued by its operators The backdoor is a regular Windows executable written in C It communicates with Google Drive cloud storage which is used as its CC serverWe named the backdoor Dolphin based on a PDB path found in the executableDDevelopmentBACKDOORDolphinx64ReleaseDolphinpdbThe backdoor periodically checks and creates its own persistence by making sure that Step 1 of the loader is run every time the system is started via a registry Run value in the same way as in the installerHKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunrandomrunnameappdataPython273264pythonwexe loaderstep1 loaderencryptedstep2The following basic information about the computer and the backdoor is collectedDolphin downloads commands issued by its operators from Google Drive storage and executes them After execution the output of commands is uploaded Most of Dolphins capabilities are controlled through commandsThe most relevant capabilities are described belowBy default Dolphin searches all non-fixed drives USBs creates directory listings and exfiltrates files by extension This search can be extended to fixed drives HDDs via dedicated commandsThe following file extensions of interest specific to media documents emails and certificates are specified in the default configurationjpg doc xls ppt hwp url csv pdf show cell eml odt rtf nxl amr 3gp m4a txt msg key der cer docx xlsx pptx pfx mp3Besides this automatic search specific files can be exfiltratedIn the newer versions the default search was extended to fixed drives The command to get specific files was improved by cachingstoring it in the configuration until completionAmong regular drives Dolphin also searches portable devices such as smartphones using the Windows Portable Device WPD API It creates directory listings and exfiltrates files This functionality appeared to be under development in the first version we found for several reasonsApart from automatic search the operators can specify individual files to be exfiltrated from portable devicesIn newer versions this capability was finished and improved by adding extension filtering For unknown reasons the command to retrieve specific files from portable devices was removedDolphin logs keystrokes for windows with titles containing substrings specified in its configuration The defaults are chrome and internet explore sic This is done via the GetAsyncKeyState API with keystrokes being logged along with the window name and current time Screenshots are also taken at a configurable interval the default is once every 30 secondsScreenshots and keylogging are enabled by default and can be toggled via a commandDolphin can receive shellcode for execution The shellcode is stored in the registry under one of the following keysIt can be executed either locally or in a specified separate process that is created and injectedIn the newer versions the shellcode is stored in files instead of the registry and the stored shellcode is loaded and executed on Dolphins startup which was not the case in version 19 the original version we analyzedDolphin can execute shell commands this is done via the popen API and their output is retrievedDolphin can retrieve credentials from browsers in the form of saved passwords and cookies The following browsers are supportedIn version 22 this capability was removed presumably to avoid detection It was later restored in version 30 but in a different form It is now dynamically received from the CC in the form of shellcodeAnother one of Dolphins commands modifies the settings of the currently logged-in Google account lowering its security relative to default settings It steals the existing cookie of the logged-in account from the browser and crafts requests that modify the settingsFirst it enables access to Gmail via the IMAP protocol by sending an HTTP POST request toThen it enables less secure app access by sending an undocumented RPC request via an HTTP POST toThese modifications are referred to as thunder access in the backdoor likely being a reference to the Thunderbird email client Accessing their victims inboxes with a third-party client via IMAP probably helps ScarCruft operators maintain access to the victims emails after stealing credentials which may not be enough on their own due to Googles detection of suspicious login attemptsThis feature was found in versions 19 and 20 of the backdoor it is not present in versions 22 or 30Dolphin exfiltrates data to Google Drive storage staging the data in encrypted ZIP archives before upload The backdoor also maintains a list of files in the form of MD5 hashes in order to avoid uploading the same file multiple times This list can be reset via a dedicated commandThe backdoor contains an initial default configuration that is persisted on first run and loaded on subsequent runs It is stored in the file ProgramDatavariablecfgnameinf where variablecfgname is randomly selected from existing filenames matching windirinfinf The content is encrypted using AES CBC with random 16-byte keys and IVs which are stored at the files beginning The configuration uses JSON format with hash-like keys An example of a decrypted configuration is shown in Figure 3Figure 3 Dolphin backdoor configurationThe configuration can be modified through commands It contains among others the followingSince the initial discovery of Dolphin in April 2021 we have observed multiple versions of the backdoor in which the threat actors improved the backdoors capabilities and made attempts to evade detection Figure 4 summarizes the versions seen a more detailed description of the version changes is provided belowFigure 4 Dolphin evolution timelineVersion 20 introduced the following changes to the version found in April 2021Changes introduced in version 22 focused mainly on detection evasion The credential-stealing capability and commands related to it the credential stealing and Google account commands were removed Most strings in this version are base64 encodedIn version 30 the code was reorganized and classes renamed with capabilities remaining unchanged The base64-encoded strings were plaintext again in this version We observed the following additional changesThe differences between versions 22 and 30 especially the discrepancy in string encoding suggest the possibility that the versions were being developed in parallel by different peopleDolphin is another addition to ScarCrufts extensive arsenal of backdoors abusing cloud storage services After being deployed on selected targets it searches the drives of compromised systems for interesting files and exfiltrates them to Google Drive One unusual capability found in prior versions of the backdoor is the ability to modify the settings of victims Google and Gmail accounts to lower their security presumably in order to maintain account access for the threat actors During our analysis of multiple versions of the Dolphin backdoor we saw continued development and attempts to evade

A Hyundai spokesperson shared the following comment with BleepingComputerHyundai worked diligently with third-party consultants to investigate the purported vulnerability as soon as the researchers brought it to our attentionImportantly other than the Hyundai vehicles and accounts belonging to the researchers themselves our investigation indicated that no customer vehicles or accounts were accessed by others as a result of the issues raised by the researchersWe also note that in order to employ the purported vulnerability the e-mail address associated with the specific Hyundai account and vehicle as well as the specific web-script employed by the researchers were required to be knownNevertheless Hyundai implemented countermeasures within days of notification to further enhance the safety and security of our systems Hyundai would also like to clarify that we were not affected by the SXM authorization flawWe value our collaboration with security researchers and appreciate this teams assistanceUpdate 3 121 - A SiriusXM spokesperson sent the following comment to BleepingComputerWe take the security of our customers accounts seriously and participate in a bug bounty program to help identify and correct potential security flaws impacting our platformsAs part of this work a security researcher submitted a report to Sirius XM's Connected Vehicle Services on an authorization flaw impacting a specific telematics program The issue was resolved within 24 hours after the report was submitted At no point was any subscriber or other data compromised nor was any unauthorized account modified using this methodUpdate 12221 This article incorrectly stated the researchers worked for Yuga Labs"
