in mixed mode with assembly code The newly discovered version is likely intended for phishing attacks focused around Iraq using an ISO file to initiate the infection chain Other documents inside the ISO file were in Hebrew and Arabic languages suggesting the lures were aimed at Israeli targetsAs the details of this attack were uncovered two other very similar lures have drawn our research teams attention Based on internal naming conventions and previous submissions we assume with medium confidence that those lures were part of testing efforts of the same threat actorCheck Point Research tracks this activity cluster asEducated ManticoreEducated Manticore deployment of PowerLess is a multi-staged process that contains several custom componentsThe complete chain is depicted belowThe fileIraq development resourcesisowas submitted to VirusTotal by two submitters from Israeli IP addresses At the time of this writing it has 0 detections possibly affected by its large size 185 MB It is worth noting that the initial loader embedded in the ISO file also has a low detection rateThe ISO file is designed to deceive the user Its structure is unique containing a relatively large number of files in three hidden folders with names containing non-breaking spaces in addition to the initial loader disguised as a folder as wellA summary of the files in the ISO imageOf the three folders the first contains an encrypted version of a custom downloader stored aszoomjpg The second and third are identical in terms of subfolder and file names while one contains actual PDF lures and the other contains the same files XORed with0x0ain the decimal format The lures were divided into subfolders by language containing files in Arabic English and Hebrew All of them are PDF files with academic content about Iraq suggesting the targets might have been academic researchersWhat might appear in the picture as a fourth folder is actually the initial loader a PE file namedIraq development resourcesexethat is disguised as an empty folder prompting users to click it without noticing its extensionThe Initial loader itself is obfuscated most likely with compiler-generated pattern-based obfuscation In this case the obfuscation resulted in about 1282 blocks full of junk code Appendix A provides a dedicated IDAPython script we created to de-obfuscate the codeUpon execution the initial loaderThe decrypted file extracted fromzoomjpgis 64-bit PE with the main purpose of downloading and executing the next stages The downloader is obfuscated similar to the initial loader affected with the same compiler-generated pattern-based obfuscation and can also be de-obfuscated with the same script provided in Appendix A The string decryption is also implemented similarly but this time using 16 different customized string-decryption functions based on TEA32 Tiny-Encryption-AlgorithmAfter it is loaded into memory and run the downloaderRight upon the first inspection of the PE structure a few characteristics point to this NET sample being constructed as Mixed-Mode Assembly The IL Only flag inside the NET directory flags is not checked This means that the sample could contain not only IL code but also unmanaged code In addition the Import Directory contains a set of entries for native librariesReverse-engineering a mixed-mode assembly code is different from pure NET assembly code requiring both native and IL code disassemblers The native CRT entry pointmainCRTStartupredirects the execution back to the managed code directly to the methodmain where all logic

the ones in the previously reported sample provides insight into the significant development the payload has gone through Among the new features showing the list of installed programs showing the list of processes showing a list of files stealing user data from the Telegram desktop app and taking screenshotsAmong its capabilities PowerLess can download extra modules including a keylogger browser information stealer and a surroundings sound recorder Previous reports have linked a similar sound recording tool to PowerLess actors but since then they embed it within the malware and activate it upon the sound command from the CC server The tool is downloaded from the server and saved asCWindowstempugtsozipPowerLess CC communication to the server is Base64-encoded and encrypted after obtaining a key from the server To mislead researchers the threat actor actively adds three random letters at the beginning of the encoded blobThe backdoor starts by initiating a request to receive the communication encryption key from the CC serverIn response the CC server sends a key and a first-time flagIn the first run the PowerShell backdoor enumerates the system and sends recon data nested in info including the computer name username operating system IP address installation path computer manufacturer and security software installedIn addition the backdoor sends the list of processes and programs from the victims computer After sending the relevant information the backdoor begins to check periodically every 48 to 72 seconds for commands from the CC server using thefetchcommandrequestThe first command received from the CC server achieves persistence on the victims computer by adding the keyshellwith the valuesyscall02exeto thewinlogonregistry key The persistence command is followed by a command to get logical disk names The commands separated by are sent immediately after the connection is established which leads us to believe that it is an automated processWhile analyzing the newly discovered PowerLess lures the CPR team came across a different intrusion set that shares several characteristics with the attack chain described above This intrusion set consists of two archive filesAlthough there is no clear technical overlap between the PowerLess activity and this intrusion set with the two archive files they are likely related Among the similarities between the two different intrusion setsIt is evident that the second campaign is incomplete and might have been part of a personal project conducted by its developer as indicated by the PDB pathDPersonal Cmppersonal projectWorkSpacePROJREVaathat appears in some of the samples It is likely that this personal project was developed in the same context of the PowerLess lure described above and might have taken inspiration from it or influenced itThe LNK file stored in the RAR archive executes a PowerShell script that extracts the XORed PE file from the LNK file and runs it This PE file then downloads two files from the CC server At the time of our analysis the payloads were no longer available for download Other artifacts retrieved throughout the analysis of the second lureSignedAgreementzip as well as additional files found on VirusTotal lead us to believe that one downloaded file is the backdoor while the second file is used to run it in memoryClicking the malicious LNK file triggers a PowerShell script that extracts a PE file embedded within it saving it to thetempfolder The script then executes the extracted file Additionally the fileGovernanceandDevelopmentinIraqjpgis saved to thetempfolder asNewtonsoftJsondlltmp1940166302exeruns a PowerShell script to download two files from the CC server and executes them It is worth noting that the file names change randomly with each EXE runThe file PDB path suggests it might have been part of a personal projectDPersonal Cmppersonal projectWorkSpacePROJREVaaImageLoderFinalx64ReleaseImageLoderFinalpdbPivoting from this path three additional samples surfaced all namedAgentFinalexe These samples were all uploaded to VirusTotal on the same day and are different versions of the same payload The payload seems to be a relatively immature version of an implant only capable of communicating with the CC server and executing commandsThe domain used in the payloadblackturtlehoptoorg resolves to the same IP address as the domaindeersharpforkinfo that was used in the infection chain Furthermore theAgentFinalexepayload uses theNewtonsoftJsondlllibrary from the original archiveBased on this information it is likely that the final payload in this infection chain is a NET payload with similar capabilities toAgentFinalexeThe additional archive found closely resemblesIraq-projectrarin terms of its infection chain and implementation with the only exception being the use of a DLL file instead of an EXE file Nevertheless both PE files have the same objective of downloading two files from the CC serverSimilar toIraq-projectrar the final payloads for this infection chain were not available at the time of our analysis However one of the downloaded fileswmaessexe was submitted to VirusTotal This file is utilized to run the PE file in memory When executed by the DLL it receives the second downloaded file from the CC serverWinMAPIexe as an argumentThe samples within this archive are reaching out to the same CC server deersharpforkinfoSince 2021 a new cluster of activity with clear ties to Iran has caught the attention of the Threat Intelligence community The aggressive nature of the new threat in combination with their ties to ransomware deployments led to a thorough analysis of its activities It was commonly called Nemesis Kitten TunnelVision or Cobalt MirageWhat started as an extremely loud campaign targeting networks opportunistically was soon exposed as tied to previously reported Iranian threat actors most prominently with those who align to some extent with APT35 Charming Kitten or Phosphorus Although different in nature and targeting it shared some characteristics with the well-known actors including infrastructure indicating a possible common organization affiliationBecause we have no sufficient knowledge to place the activities around the PowerLess backdoor in this complex puzzle we have decided to track this activity separately based on a new naming convention adopted by Check Point Research According to the new convention labeling threats as mythical creatures Iranian-aligned threats areManticoresBecause the lures in the activity described in this report were academic in nature and because overlapping activities often pursue similar targets we have decided to name this actorEducated ManticoreIn this report we analyzed newly discovered infection chains attributed to Educated Manticore a threat actor aligned with the Iranian state interests Based on Check Point Research observations as demonstrated in this report Educated Manticore continues to evolve refining previously observed toolsets and delivering mechanismsAnalysis of the new PowerLess variant suggests the actor adopts popular trends to avoid detection such as using archive files and ISO images In parallel to adopting these trends they keep developing custom toolsets using advanced techniques such as NET binaries using Mixed Mode AssemblyThe variant described in this report was delivered using ISO files indicating it is likely meant to be the initial infection vector Because it is an updated version of previously reported malware PowerLess associated with some of Phosphorus Ransomware operations it is important to note that it might only represent the early stages of infection with significant fractions of post-infection activity yet to be seen in the wildCheck Point Customers remain protected against the threat described in this

        "text": "There is an urgent need to create a culture of up-leveling and raising the baseline culture when it comes to design security and transparency of the processes that promote security like processes that support qualified disclosure she addedThe Biden administration first announced its plans to work with the private sector federal agencies and academic institutions on advancing a national cybersecurity labeling program for IoT devices in November noting it was a priority for its ongoing critical infrastructure security plans Given the prevalence of the devices and growth of the market a labeling program would assure consumers these devices are safe and incentivize manufacturers to meet higher cybersecurity standardsThe recent executive order directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST to pilot and label consumer-facing IoT cybersecurity products explained Katerina Megas NISTs cybersecurity for IoT program manager So the team has been working to build on the core baseline which is designed to apply across the board for all IoT devices irrespective of market sectorVery early on the project leaders found a consistent theme of fragmentation within the IoT market itself NIST has since started to build on the common core baseline to tailor it to specific risk profiles working with industry stakeholders and inviting public comments to better understand the appropriate baseline for consumer-facing devicesThe effort has received positive feedback from the industrySamsung is here to support a voluntary IoT cyber labeling program here in the United States that's globally harmonized and incentivizes manufacturers for adoption said Eric Tamarkin senior director and public policy counsel of US Public Affairs for Samsung Electronics AmericaWe've been working with our industry partners on this and we hope for a successful launch he addedLabels refer to the requirements and other aspects of a security program much like an offensive declaration for a consumer IoT product anchored to NIST criteria The ongoing focus for consumer device labeling is a common market screening or padlock for these devicesThe existing label program has criteria for use of the market license the program the scheme and who takes ownership of these issues within the business to manage business processes with manufacturers signed contracts sublicense support from the oversight structure the program owner and federal aidIt should be clear however that this is not a single structure Michael Bergman vice president of technology and standards for the Consumer Technology Association IoT is too broad and too fast and too varied to use a single schemeFor example drones are different from doorbell cameras drones fly over the horizon mobile cameras to the cloud he continued adding that whats needed is multiple schemes licensed to issue the mark At the end of the day we need some kind of oversight structureCurrently the government is working to understand the trust mechanisms that must be built into the programThese security conversations are not just about right now its about planning for the future Elazari explained Device labeling should be thought about within the context of a broader conversation on both baseline security measures as well as the importance of connecting or securing all connected devicesSo far the NIST project has made key determinations For one the scope of IoT in general is too broad for a standard set of criteria able to apply to both drones and doorbellsThe optimal way to approach this would be to articulate requirements as cybersecurity outcomes and to get very specific into how we expect those cybersecurity outcomes to be achieved said Megas In the end there will be a program owner ultimately responsible and NISTs role is to provide those recommendationsIt will be ultimately up to the programmer to determine how they will apply those recommendations how they will enforce them and accept them she added Our role will be to be there to advise the program owner on all of the recommendations and also to help advise on formative assessment programsAnd thats where being proactive will enable device manufacturers to keep pace during the ongoing regulatory shiftThe voice of healthcare cybersecurity and policy for SC Media CyberRisk Alliance driving industry-specific

        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories24 Apr 2023 minute readTable of ContentsAuthorsWe continued to track Tomiris as a separate threat actor over three new attack campaigns between 2021 and 2023 and our telemetry allowed us to shed light on the group In this blog post were excited to share what we now know of Tomiris with the broader community and discuss further evidence of a possible connection to TurlaThe following map shows the countries where we detected Tomiris targets colored in green Afghanistan and CIS members or ratifiers It is worth noting that while we identified a few targets in other locations all of them appear to be foreign diplomatic entities of the colored countriesTomiris uses a wide variety of malware implants developed at a rapid pace and in all programming languages imaginable We hypothesize that the general aim is to provide operators with full-spectrum malware in order to evade security products In fact on several occasions we observed the actor persistently cycling through available malware strains until one of them was finally allowed to run on victim machinesTools used by Tomiris fall into three categoriesIn addition Tomiris leveraged open-source or commercially available implants and offensive tools Notably the latter were associated with Tomiris because they were downloaded from Tomiris downloader shared a common C2 with other Tomiris implants andor were leveraged to deploy other Tomiris implantsRelationships between Tomiris tools Arrows indicate direct executionOverall pieces from the Tomiris toolset appear to be generally interchangeable and dont appear to be tied to specific campaigns or victims Operators routinely mix and match the various families trying to deploy tools often repeatedly with little regard for stealth until one doesnt get caught by antivirus softwareThe following paragraphs provide a summary description of the main malware strains used by TomirisTelemiris is a Python backdoor originally packed with PyInstaller we later identified some Nuitka-packaged samples as well Its name derives from the fact that it uses Telegram as a C2 channel After setting up persistence copying itself under AppDataservice and creating a RUN key entry the malware enters its main loop where it waits for Telegram messages and replies to them Supported commands areFrom what we observed Telemiris is used as a first-stage implant that operators use to deploy other tools such as Roopy JLORAT or even the legitimate WinSCP binary to further exfiltrate filesThen every 40-80 minutes Roopy crawls CUsers and all other drives D E looks for all documents doc docx xls xlsx txt pdf modified in the last month and stages them for upload Discovered files are collected in ZIP archives up to 5MB in size and sent to the C2 server over plain HTTP using POST requests containing such data asThis data format naming convention as well as the URL scheme used by the C2 server ie hpa are very similar to SBZ filestealer We identified a number of variants of Roopy where logging can be either enabled or disabled by default or where the base64 encoding scheme was replaced by a simple subtraction from the bytes of the obfuscated dataJLORAT then looks for specific keywords in the data returned by the C2 to start processing ordersData sent to port 9999 is not passed in a JSON dictionary but instead follows a specific formatWe also discovered variants of JLORAT bundled with additional modules effectively turning it into a file stealer we call JLOGRAB Just like Roopy JLOGRABJLORAT contains traces of Russian language in status messages meaning Directory set The source binary also contains metadata indicating some of the source code is stored in a moduls folder which appears to be a misspelling of the English word modules or a poor transliteration of the Russian word pronounced modulWhile publicly available data indeed shows that anam0rphsu was re-registered on August 12 2022 we couldnt find any link between Andromeda and KopiLuwak from our telemetry Nevertheless we had been tracking QUIETCANARY since 2019 under the name TunnusSched not Tunnus as Mandiants reporting indicates and decided to take a closer look at samples collected during the same periodTo our great surprise we discovered one TunnusSchedQUIETCANARY sample MD5 B38160FC836AD42F1753A0873C844925 had been delivered to a government target in the CIS on September 13 2022 Our telemetry additionally shows that this TunnusSched malware was deployedfrom Tomiriss Telemiris MD5 C49DBF390E876E926A338EA07AC5D4A7More precisely on September 13 2022 around 0540 UTC an operator attempted to deploy several known Tomiris implants via Telemiris first a Python Meterpreter loader then JLORAT and Roopy These efforts were thwarted by security products which led the attacker to make repeated attempts from various locations on the filesystemAll these attempts ended in failure After a one-hour pause the operator tried again at 0719 UTC this time using a TunnusSchedQUIETCANARY sampleThe TunnusSched sample was blocked as well and the operator resumed trying to deploy JLORAT and Roopy samples up to the next day This activity and brute-force approach to infection is completely consistent with other Tomiris infections we have observed in the pastMandiant noted that some elements of the recent TunnuSched case they analyzed appear to be a departure from historical Turla operations but the use of KopiLuwak and TunnusSched led them to link this activity to Turla anyway In order to perform a critical analysis of this attribution process we need to go back in timeStarting from 2019 we discovered additional implant families that were linked to KopiLuwak and so to Turla starting from 2019 The implants were additionally linked together mainly because they leverage an identical RC4 implementationCode similarity between Topinambour left and TunnusSched rightThe RC4 implementation in these samples results in strictly identical NET bytecode that as far as we could verify is unique to Tunnus TunnusSched and TopinambourThe fact that all these implants are interconnected leaves little doubt and Topinambour at least is strongly linked with KopiLuwak As a result we still believe with high confidence that TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are both part of similar toolsets starting from 2019 at the latestMandiants recent findings also confirm that KopiLuwak and TunnusSched were still part of the same toolset as of September 2022 as they were both deployed against targets in Ukraine during a single operationAs we recently discovered and detailed in Tomiriss deployment spree TunnusSched giveaway TunnusSched was leveraged by Tomiris against a government target in the CIS in September 2022Additionally we believe with medium confidence the TunnusSched usage described by Mandiant to be part of Tomiriss operations becauseAs we have already established TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are part of similar toolsets starting from 2019 at least They were also used together during the same operation in September 2022 in the CIS while TunnusSched was also deployed separately by Tomiris in the CIS both independently analyzed cases leveraging very similar TunnusSched samplesAs a result we believe with medium-to-high confidence that both TunnusSched and KopiLuwak are being leveraged by Tomiris Additionally we cannot rule out Tomiris having used KopiLuwak as early as 2019 conducting operations that may have been wrongly attributed to Turla back thenThis entire discussion would be moot if we believed Tomiris to be a sub-cluster of Turla but this is not the case While our initial blog post introducing Tomiris noted similarities with malware used in the Sunburst attack we continued to track the two sets of activity separately Years later we are convinced that despite possible ties between the two groups Turla and Tomiris are separate actors Tomiris is undoubtedly Russian-speaking but its targeting and tradecrafts are significantly at odds with what we have observed for Turla In addition Tomiriss general approach to intrusion and limited interest in stealth are significantly at odds with documented Turla tradecraftIt follows that two groups that we know of may have used KopiLuwak at different points in time What are the possible explanations for thisOur assessment is that the first two hypotheses are the least likely and that there exists a form of deliberate cooperation between Tomiris and Turla Its exact nature is however hard to determine with the information we have at hand In any case depending on when Tomiris started using KopiLuwak a number of campaigns and tools believed to be linked to Turla may in fact need to be re-evaluatedNot only Topinambour Tunnus TunnusSched QUIETCANARY and RocketMan may have been used by Tomiris in the past we know this is the case for TunnusSched and very likely for Tunnus due to the discovery of government victims in Russia in 2019 it could also be the case that these tools are Tomiriss exclusive property Looking back we cannot help but notice that all of these tools were predominantly used in the CIS region which is consistent with Tomiriss traditional victimologyWith this report we hope to alert the community to the dangers of using KopiLuwak and TunnusSched to link cyberattacks to Turla To the best of our knowledge this toolset is currently shared between Tomiris and Turla and we cannot rule out that more actors outside our purview have access to it We expect the attribution of this cluster of activities to remain unclear for the near futureIn the grander scheme of things this investigation reveals the pitfalls that the information security industry faces when working on cyberattacks We rely on a knowledge pool generously shared among all participants yet information decays what is true today may turn out to be wrong tomorrow Discovering new reliable data isnt enough existing assumptions also need to be substantiated which can only happen when vendors publish data In that spirit we kindly thank Mandiant for the research they publishedFinally this investigation illustrates the limits of technical attribution Looking at infections and malware samples only gets us so far and we are often reminded that APT groups are subject to organizational and political constraints On rare occasions we stumble upon a piece of the puzzle that allows us to pierce

        "text": "The sun rises with view of Lincoln Memorial the Washington Monument and the US Capitol in Washington on April 9 2023 Photo by Celal GunesAnadolu Agency via Getty ImagesThe House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Wednesday saw lawmakers obvious disdain over whats considered outright violations of consumer rights particularly data privacyData brokers are harvesting peoples data selling or sharing it without their knowledge and failing to keep it secure she added It certainly raises questions of how data brokers arent just violating peoples privacy but their civil liberties as well This isnt acceptable Data brokers days of surveilling in the dark should be over Prior to the pandemic the need for a federal privacy law to replace or supersede the patchwork of state regulations was a prime focus for lawmakers which saw multiple hearings between 2018 and 2019 focused on consent and opt out policies at a minimumThose conversations dwindled during the COVID-19 era but have since been revived due to the spate of reports detailing egregious privacy practices a result of the current state regulatory gaps Whats remained clear is the need for bipartisan agreement and with growing pressure it appears a federal data privacy law may be the one issue for which both parties can agreeAs Rep Frank Joseph Pallone Jr D-NJ sees it these data broker practices constitute abuses and an infringement of Americans privacy And due to the brokerage firms' shady operations most consumers have no idea their data is in the hands of these firms or how muchBut while theres certainly a need for a comprehensive privacy law its imperative that Congress does not wait to resolve the details being debated by both parties to act on this poorly regulated industryFor Sherman Congress needs to strictly control the sale of data to foreign companies and ban the sale completely for certain categories such as health location data and information tied to childrenData brokers must also be stopped from circumventing controls that allow for inferred data or composite information many of which is public to create profiles of consumers This information includes location histories political beliefs demographic details online habits and other highly sensitive information that the vast majority of consumers would never share with companiesThe firms are known for aggregating data tied to Americans public records then posting the information online for search and sale Brokers can track and sell your race religion gender sexual orientation income level how you vote what you buy what videos you watch what prescriptions you take and where your kids and grandkids go to school said ShermanThis harms every American especially the most vulnerable he addedThis is not just hyperbole inferred data has already been used to target veterans Shermans team has found individually identified data on military service members from data brokers with almost no vetting and being sold for as little as 125 cents per service memberSome tech companies including browsers like Mozilla have banded together to shore up data privacy gaps But Marshall Irwin Mozillas vice president and chief security officer noted that these efforts account for roughly half of the browser and mobile operating marketIn addition to a federal privacy law and the needed controls for data brokers lawmakers are also proposing a one stop shop that will allow consumers to request their data scraped by brokers to be deleted Sherman added there must also be a way to prevent companies from profiting from public recordsAs it stands these lawmakers are banking on the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act to begin the creation of a comprehensive privacy law McMorris Rodgers stressed that Congress is at an inflection point on responsible data collection and privacyWe will continue to build on our work from ADPPA this Congress and get these strong protections for

        "text": "Turns out 3CX was not the original target in a recent supply chain compromise affecting customers of the video conferencing software maker The attack came via a prior supply chain compromise involving Trading Technologies a provider of high-performance trading softwareThat makes the breach at 3CX one of the first known instances where an adversary used one supply chain attack to enable a second supply chain attack in an effort to try and breach multiple organizations However rather than being the victims of a targeted attack 3CX and its customers appear to have become opportunistic victims for the threat actor new research showsMandiant's investigation into how exactly UNC4736 might have compromised the 3CX environment showed the threat actor gained initial access when a 3CX employee downloaded a financial trading package called XTRADER from the website of the developer Trading TechnologiesUNC4736 actors had previously breached Trading Technologies systems according to Mandiant and inserted a backdoor in the XTRADER app's installation file When the 3CX user downloaded the app from the Trading Technologies website the installer triggered actions that resulted in a modular multi-stage backdoor called VEILEDSIGNAL landing on the individual's systemThe malware contained multiple functions including those for sending implant data executing shell code and for terminating itself VEILEDSIGNAL also included two other components one for injecting the command-and-control module on Chrome Firefox or Edge and the other for listening to incoming communicationsMarius Fodoreanu principal consultant at Mandiant and the lead investigator in the 3CX compromise says it's unclear how UNC4736Lazarus actors introduced the malicious installer for XTRADERMandiant is not performing an incident response for Trading Technologies so we don't have direct visibility into the Trading Technologies' environment he says But Mandiant has observed evidence of compromise of the Trading Technologies environment as far back as 2021 Fodoreanu saysFodoreanu says that following the initial compromise of the 3CX employee's computer in 2022 the threat actor stole the employee's corporate credentials The attackers then used the administrative-level access and persistence that VEILEDSIGNAL provided on the system to eventually compromise 3CX's Windows and macOS build environments and insert malware into finished 3CX software packagesThe breach at 3CX would not have happened in this instance if the employee hadn't downloaded the malicious XTRADER app That means the company became a collateral and therefore an opportunistic victim of the North Korean groupIf you were starting from scratch and trying to intentionally target a company like 3CX you would not go to Trading Technologies as an initial attack vector Fodoreanu concedesHowever when the threat actor discovered they had snagged a high-value victim it is likely they pressed forward more deliberately he saysYes we believe it likely started off as an opportunistic attack he says But once they figured out that they had access to a company that likely has a lot of customers they decided to continue to move forward and compromise the environment and then compromise the softwareInterestingly 3CX is neither a vendor nor a customer of Trading Technologies So it is not clear why an employee from the company would have wanted to download XTRADER a spokeswoman from Trading Technologies said in an emailed statement to Dark ReadingGiven that this only came to our attention last week we have not had the ability to verify the assertions in Mandiant's report the spokeswoman said What we do know with certainty is that 3CX is not a vendor or a customer of Trading Technologies There is no business relationship between the two companiesThe statement went on to note that Trading Technologies discontinued the XTRADER app referenced in the Mandiant report in April 2020 Mandiant itself said its investigation showed however that the app was still available for download in 2022 There was no reason for anyone to download the software given that TT stopped hosting supporting and servicing XTRADER after early 2020Fodoreanu says there is potential that other organizations might have downloaded the poisoned XTRADER app during the two years it was available on Trading Technologies' website after the company discontinued the productWe suspect there are a number of organizations that don't know they're compromised yet he says We're hopeful that now that this information is out it'll help accelerate the process for companies to determine that they're compromised and contain their incidentsThe configuration of SimplexTea also bears the same name apdlcf as SIMPLESEA the macOS malware reported in the 3CX attack Kalnai says There are also similarities in the manner in which messages are encrypted he saysCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a

        "text": "Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community Award-winning news views and insight from the ESET security community ESET ResearchSimilarities with newly discovered Linux malware used in Operation DreamJob corroborate the theory that the infamous North Korea-aligned group is behind the 3CX supply-chain attack20 Apr 2023 15 min readAdditionally this discovery helped us confirm with a high level of confidence that the recent 3CX supply-chain attack was in fact conducted by Lazarus a link that was suspected from the very beginning and demonstrated by several security researchers since In this blogpost we corroborate these findings and provide additional evidence about the connection between Lazarus and the 3CX supply-chain attack3CX is an international VoIP software developer and distributor that provides phone system services to many organizations According to its website 3CX has more than 600000 customers and 12000000 users in various sectors including aerospace healthcare and hospitality It provides client software to use its systems via a web browser mobile app or a desktop application Late in March 2023 it was discovered that the desktop application for both Windows and macOS contained malicious code that enabled a group of attackers to download and run arbitrary code on all machines where the application was installed Rapidly it was determined that this malicious code was not something that 3CX added themselves but that 3CX was compromised and that its software was used in a supply-chain attack driven by external threat actors to distribute additional malware to specific 3CX customersFigure 1 Timeline of events related to the preparation and distribution of 3CX trojanized applicationsThe timeline shows that the perpetrators had planned the attacks long before execution as early as December 2022 This suggests they already had a foothold inside 3CXs network late last yearWhile the trojanized 3CX macOS application shows it was signed in late January we did not see the bad application in our telemetry until February 14th 2023 It is unclear whether the malicious update for macOS was distributed prior to that dateAlthough ESET telemetry shows the existence of the macOS second-stage payload as early as February we did not have the sample itself nor metadata to tip us off about its maliciousness We include this information to help defenders determine how far back systems might have been compromisedSeveral days before the attack was publicly revealed a mysterious Linux downloader was submitted to VirusTotal It downloads a new Lazarus malicious payload for Linux and we explain its relationship to the attack later in the textThe filenames but not MD5s of these samples coincide with those from Kasperskys blogpost However 3CX explicitly states that COLDCAT differs from GopuramThe next section contains a technical description of the new Lazarus malicious Linux payload we recently analyzed as well as how it helped us strengthen the existing link between Lazarus and the 3CX compromiseOn March 20th a user in the country of Georgia submitted to VirusTotal a ZIP archive called HSBC job offerpdfzip Given other DreamJob campaigns by Lazarus this payload was probably distributed through spearphishing or direct messages on LinkedIn The archive contains a single file a native 64-bit Intel Linux binary written in Go and named HSBC job offerpdfAs the last step of its execution the OdicLoader modifies bashprofile so SimplexTea is launched with Bash and its output is

similarities with Lazaruss Windows backdoor called BADCALLWe attribute sysnetd to Lazarus because of its similarities with the following two files and we believe thatsysnetd is a Linux variant of the groups backdoor for Windows called BADCALLFigure 4 Similarities between a Windows and a Linux variant of BADCALL a list of domains used as a front for a fake TLS connectionFigure 5 Similarities between AppleJeus for macOS and the Linux variant of BADCALL the key for the A51 stream cipherThis Linux version of the BADCALL backdoor sysnetd loads its configuration from a file named tmpvgauthsvclog Since Lazarus operators have previously disguised their payloads the use of this name which is used by the VMware Guest Authentication service suggests that the targeted system may be a Linux VMware virtual machine Interestingly the XOR key in this case is the same as one used in SIMPLESEA from the 3CX investigationFigure 6 Loading a configuration file by BADCALL for Linux cf Figure 8Taking a look at the three 32-bit integers 0xC2B45678 0x90ABCDEF and 0xFE268455 from Figure 5 which represent a key for a custom implementation of the A51 cipher we realized that the same algorithm and the identical keys were used in Windows malware that dates back to the end of 2014 and was involved in one of the most notorious Lazarus cases the cybersabotage of Sony Pictures Entertainment SHA-1 1C66E67A8531E3FF1C64AE57E6EDFDE7BEF2352DFigure 7 The decryption routine shared between the BADCALL for Linux and targeted destructive malware for Windows from 2014To recap what weve covered so far we attribute the 3CX supply-chain attack to the Lazarus group with a high level of confidence This is based on the following factorsFigure 8 Loading a configuration file by SimplexTea for Linux cf Figure 6Figure 9 A hardcoded URL in SimplexTea for LinuxThe 3CX compromise has gained a lot of attention from the security community since its disclosure on March 29th This compromised software deployed on various IT infrastructures which allows the download and execution of any kind of payload can have devastating impacts Unfortunately no software publisher is immune to being compromised and inadvertently distributing trojanized versions of their applicationsIt is also interesting to note that Lazarus can produce and use malware for all major desktop operating systems Windows macOS and Linux Both Windows and macOS systems were targeted during the 3CX incident with 3CXs VoIP software for both operating systems being trojanized to include malicious code to fetch arbitrary payloads In the case of 3CX both Windows and macOS second-stage malware versions exist This article demonstrates the existence of a Linux backdoor that probably corresponds to the SIMPLESEA macOS malware seen in the 3CX incident We named this Linux component SimplexTea and showed that it is part of Operation DreamJob Lazaruss flagship campaign using job offers to lure and

Mandiant identified that the initial compromise vector of 3CXs network was via malicious software downloaded from Trading Technologies website This is the first time Mandiant has seen a software supply chain attack lead to another software supply chain attackMandiant Consulting identified an installer with the filename XTRADERr71790p608exe MD5 ef4ab22e565684424b4142b1294f1f4d which led to the deployment of a malicious modular backdoor VEILEDSIGNALAlthough the XTRADER platform was reportedly discontinued in 2020 it was still available for download from the legitimate Trading Technologies website in 2022 This file was signed with the subject Trading Technologies International Inc and contained the executable file Setupexe that was also signed with the same digital certificate The code signing certificate used to digitally sign the malicious software was set to expire in October 2022 The installer contains and executes Setupexe which drops two trojanized DLLs and a benign executable Setupexe uses the benign executable to side-load one of the malicious DLLs Side-loading relies on legitimate Windows executables to load and execute a malicious file that has been disguised as a legitimate dependency The loaded malicious DLLs contains and uses SIGFLIP and DAVESHELL to decrypt and load the payload into memory from the other dropped malicious executable SIGFLIP relies on RC4 stream-cipher to decrypt the payload of choice and uses the byte sequence FEEDFACE to find the shellcode in this case DAVESHELL during the decryption stageSIGFLIP and DAVESHELL extract and execute a

URL wwwtradingtechnologiescomtradingorder-management The compromised XTRADER and 3CXDesktopApp applications both contain extract and run a payload in the same way although the final payload is different Mandiant analyzed these samples and observed the following similarities Mandiant was able to reconstruct the attackers steps throughout the environment as they harvested credentials and moved laterally Eventually the attacker was able to compromise both the Windows and macOS build environments On the Windows build environment the attacker deployed a TAXHAUL launcher and COLDCAT downloader that persisted by performing DLL search order hijacking through the IKEEXT service and ran with LocalSystem privileges The macOS build server was compromised with POOLRAT backdoor using Launch Daemons as a persistence mechanism Previous reporting mentioned the macOS build server was compromised with SIMPLESEA Mandiant Intelligence completed analysis of the sample and determined it to be the backdoor POOLRAT instead of a new malware familyUNC4736 demonstrates varying degrees of overlap with multiple North Korean operators tracked by Mandiant Intelligence especially with those involved in financially-motivated cybercrime operations These clusters have demonstrated a sustained focus on cryptocurrency and fintech-related services over time Mandiant assesses with moderate confidence that UNC4736 is related to financially motivated North Korean AppleJeus activity as reported by CISA This is further corroborated with findings from Google TAG who reported the compromise

        "text": "A security vulnerability in Google's Cloud Platform GCP could have allowed cyberattackers to hide an unremovable malicious application inside a victim's Google account dooming the account to a state of permanent undetectable infectionThe bug dubbed GhostToken was discovered and reported by Astrix Security researchers According to an analysis released by the team on April 20 the malicious app could have paved the way for a startling array of nefarious activity including reading the victim's Gmail account accessing files in Google Drive and Google Photos viewing the Google calendar and tracking locations via Google MapsArmed with that information attackers could craft extremely convincing impersonation and phishing attacks or even place the person in physical dangerUsing the GhostToken vulnerability cyberattackers can craft a malicious application that they can plant in one of the app stores masquerading as a legitimate utility or service But once downloaded the app will hide itself from the victim's Google account application management pageFor the user it basically disappearsSince this is the only place Google users can see their applications and revoke their access the exploit makes the malicious app unremovable from the Google account according to the analysis The attacker on the other hand as they please can unhide their application and use the token to access the victim's account and then quickly hide the application again to restore its unremovable state In other words the attacker holds a 'ghost' token to the victim's accountThis specific vulnerability allowed cyberattackers on one side to have access to organizational GCP environments but on the other side to people's personal Google Photos and their email accounts he says It's worth remembering that these different services that we use every day for everything are actually prone to these kinds of challenges and it's all about how we use it and on the other side how we secure itAs far as how it could be exploited it starts with the fact thatevery application offered to Google users in the Google Marketplace or other websites is associated with a single GCP project that hosts it If the owner of the GCP project usually the developer deletes it it enters what Astrix refers to as a limbo-like pending deletion state and it stays that way for 30 days until it's fully purged and deletedThese pending-deletion projects can be completely restored at the owner's whim from a dedicated page made for that purpose However for end users the app immediately disappears from the apps with access to your account management pageThus the attack scenario goes like thisNormally when we talk about vulnerabilities these are things that are broken that you can just patch and continue on he explains But in this case it was actually a core feature of GCP and how you create projects in GCP It's actually nice to be able to revert to things that you did in the past that you didn't mean to erase But on the other hand with a little bit of creativity and a very straightforward approach it could be turned into something that can completely break the way that identity and access management is done by an external third party that was integrated to this environment OAuthAnd indeed the bug speaks to the ongoing push-pull between usability and security that's felt within all parts of an enterprise environment Gour notesEarlier this month Google rolled out a global patch fixing the issue by making sure that apps in a pending deletion state are still visible in a user's app management screen However Astrix researchers warned that while they aren't aware of active exploitation Google Workspace administrators should look for applications that may have attacked users before the patch was initiated on April 7This can be done in two ways the researchers saidCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place London SW1P 1WG"

Play carries out double-extortion attacks where the attackers exfiltrate data from victim networks before encrypting them While the ransomware gang had an initial focus on organizations in Latin America especially Brazil it soon widened its targetingPlay is also notable as it doesnt appear to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service with Balloonfly seemingly carrying out the ransomware attacks as well as developing the malwareCustom tools are increasingly being used by ransomware gangs in their attacks This is likely due to a number of reasons such as making attacks more efficient and reducing dwell time Custom tools can be tailored to a specific target environment allowing ransomware gangs to carry out attacks faster and more efficiently The use of proprietary tools also gives ransomware operators more control over their operations If a tool is widely available it can be reverse-engineered or adapted by other attackers potentially weakening the initial attack's effectiveness By

and procedures TTPs Specifically this subset has rapidly weaponized N-day vulnerabilities in common enterprise applications and conducted highly-targeted phishing campaigns to quickly and successfully access environments of interest This Mint Sandstorm subgroup has also continued to develop and use custom tooling in selected targets notably organizations in the energy and transportation sectors Given this subgroups capabilities the profile of past targets and the potential for cascading effects Microsoft is publishing details on known tradecraft alongside corresponding detections and mitigations to help organizations protect against this and similar threatsToday Microsoft is reporting on a distinct Mint Sandstorm subgroup that specializes in hacking into and stealing sensitive information from high-value targets This Mint Sandstorm subgroup is technically and operationally mature capable of developing bespoke tooling and quickly weaponizing N-day vulnerabilities and has demonstrated agility in its operational focus which appears to align with Irans national prioritiesMicrosoft Threat Intelligence consistently tracks threat actor activity including Mint Sandstorm and its subgroups and works across Microsoft Security products and services to build detections into our products that improve protection for customers As with any observed nation state actor activity Microsoft directly notifies customers that have been targeted or compromised providing them with the information they need to secure their accounts Microsoft is sharing details on these operations to raise awareness on the risks associated with their activity and to empower organizations to harden their attack surfaces against tradecraft commonly used by this Mint Sandstorm subgroupMicrosoft has observed multiple attack chains and various tools in compromises involving this Mint Sandstorm subgroup The TTPs detailed below are a sampling of new or otherwise notable tradecraft used by this actorWhile this subgroup has demonstrated their ability to rapidly incorporate new public POCs into their playbooks Microsoft has also observed that Mint Sandstorm continues to use older vulnerabilities especially Log4Shell to compromise unpatched devices As this activity is typically opportunistic and indiscriminate Microsoft recommends that organizations regularly patch vulnerabilities with publicly available POCs regardless of how long the POC has been availableAfter gaining initial access to an organization by exploiting a vulnerability with a public POC this Mint Sandstorm subgroup deploys a custom PowerShell script designed for discovery In some cases the subgroup does not act on the information they collect possibly because they assess that a victim does not meet any targeting requirements or because the subgroup wishes to wait and focus on more valuable targets In cases where Mint Sandstorm operators continue their pursuit of a given target Microsoft typically observes one of two possible attack chainsSince 2022Microsoft has observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup using two custom implants detected by Microsoft security products as Drokbk and Soldier to persist in target environments and deploy additional tools Drobkbk and Soldier both use Mint Sandstorm-controlled GitHub repositories to host a domain rotator containing the operators C2 domains This allows Mint Sandstorm to dynamically update their C2 infrastructure which may help the operators stay a step ahead of defenders using list-based domain blockingIn certain cases this Mint Sandstorm subgroup has used TTPs outside of these attack chains notably when they have failed to achieve short-term objectives In one instance Microsoft also observed the subgroup using TTPs from both attack chains in a single compromised environment However in most cases Mint Sandstorm activity displays one of the above discussed attack chainsMicrosoft has also observed this Mint Sandstorm subgroup using a distinct attack chain involving low-volume phishing campaigns and a third custom implant In these operations the group crafts bespoke phishing emails often purporting to contain information on security policies that affect countries in the Middle East to deliver weaponized documents to individuals of interest Recipients are typically individuals affiliated with high-profile think tanks or universities in Israel North America or Europe with ties to the security and policy communities Unlike their initial exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing applications which is largely indiscriminate and affects organizations across sectors and geographies activity associated with this campaign was highly targeted and affected fewer than 10 organizationsThe initial emails are most commonly lures designed to social engineer recipients into clicking a OneDrive link hosting a PDF spoofed to resemble information on a topic involving security or policy in the Middle East The PDF contains a link to a macro-enabled template file dotm hosted on Dropbox This file has been weaponized with macros to perform remote template injection a technique that allows operators to obtain and launch a payload from a remote C2 often OneDrive Template injection is an attractive option for adversaries looking to execute malicious code without drawing scrutiny from defenders This technique can also be used to persist in a compromised environment if an adversary replaces a default template used by a common applicationCapabilities observed in intrusions attributed to this Mint Sandstorm subgroup are concerning as they allow operators to conceal C2 communication persist in a compromised system and deploy a range of post-compromise tools with varying capabilities While effects vary depending on the operators post-intrusion activities even initial access can enable unauthorized access and facilitate further behaviors that may adversely impact the confidentiality integrity and availability of an environment A successful intrusion creates liabilities and may harm an organizations reputation especially those responsible for delivering services to others such as critical infrastructure providers which Mint Sandstorm has targeted in the past As these operators increasingly develop and use sophisticated capabilities organizations must develop corresponding defenses to harden their attack surfaces and raise costs for these operators Microsoft will continue to monitor Mint Sandstorm activity and implement protections for our customers The current detections advanced detections and IOCs in place across our security products are detailed below and shared with the broader security community to help detect and prevent further attacksThe techniques

        "text": "Cameron Camp had purchased a Juniper SRX240H router last year on eBay to use in a honeypot network he was building to study remote desktop protocol RDP exploits and attacks on Microsoft Exchange and industrial control systems ICS devices When the longtime security researcher at Eset booted up the secondhand Juniper router to his surprise it displayed a hostnameAfter taking a closer look at the device Camp contacted Tony Anscombe Eset's chief security evangelist to alert him to what he found on the router This thing has a whole treasure trove of Silicon Valley A-list software company information on it Camp recalls telling AnscombeWe got very very concerned Camp saysCamp and Anscombe decided to test their theory that this could be the tip of the iceberg for other decommissioned routers still harboring information from their previous owners' networks They purchased several more decommissioned core routers four Cisco Systems ASA 5500 three Fortinet FortiGate and 11 Juniper Networks SRX Series Services Gateway routersAfter dropping a few from the mix after one failed to power up and another two were actually mirrored routers from a former cluster they found that nine of the remaining 16 held sensitive core networking configuration information corporate credentials and data on corporate applications customers vendors and partners The applications exposed on the routers were from big-name software vendors used in many enterprises Microsoft Exchange LyncSkype PeopleSoft Salesforce Microsoft SharePoint Spiceworks SQL VMWare Horizon View voice over IP apps File Transfer Protocol FTP and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP applicationsThe routers contained one or more set of IPSec or VPN credentials or hashed root passwords and each had sufficient data for the researchers to identify the actual previous owneroperator of the device Nearly 90 included router-to-router authentication keys and details on applications connected to the networks some 44 had network credentials to other networks such as a supplier or partner 33 included third-party connections to the network and 22 harbored customer informationI have the entire network topology of their core infrastructure both internal and external like cloud assets for example Camp saysCamp says the discovery was a far cry from the malware he typically studies and a lot less work for an attacker who happened upon one of these unwiped routers I don't need a zero day I have your router quips CampThey are the intersection upon everything that happens in your organization Camp says of core routers Everything touches the router including many cloud services he addsAmong the organizations whose information was exposed were a manufacturing company a US law firm managed services providers an open source software firm an events company a telecommunications equipment supplier a global data company and a creative services company Eset did not disclose the names of the organizations but the researchers confirmed that they contacted all of themThe Silicon Valley software vendor was quick to respond even awarding Camp a bug bounty that he then donated to the Electronic Freedom Foundation and the Tor Project But that was the researchers' easiest disclosureOnce we stepped outside of the tech sector it was incredibly different and harder to disclose our findings Anscombe notes The other organizations didn't have processes or even people available to handle the disclosure information he saysMeanwhile one of the unwiped routers contained what Camp describes as a creepy remote administration interfaceI was never sure if it was on purpose but it was creepy very low-level access and from one of the countries with flags that we're the US not happy with right now he says It could be totally legit or that could be really bad It was a little edgy to meSo how do you wipe a router that you want to retire The good news is most routers are fairly easy to securely decommission and the big three Cisco Fortinet and Juniper on their websites provide detailed guidelines for restoring devices to their factory default settingsWith Juniper routers for example wiping the device is simple Going to config setting and type 'delete' hit 'Y' to confirm and now that router doesn't know who it is anymore Camp says The entire wiping process takes less than five minutes including the post-deletion rebootAnd if your organization already had disposed of routers that weren't properly wiped Eset recommends rotating cryptographic keys in case an attacker were to get their hands on your old router and attempt to gain trusted access to your network Zero trust can help here as well they sayBut that's still no guarantee that a malicious actor who buys your old router still couldn't use it to target your organization Even if somebody goes and changes the credentials of the accounts being cached in router potentially the attacker has got the app lists so they can tell what apps are run internally locally or in the cloud Abscombe saysThat gives the attacker just enough intel to plan a targeted attack according to Abscombe If I know they're running a specific version of Exchange and that version had a CVE and they had not applied the patch I suddenly know things about their network that can make them vulnerable he says If you buy a secondhand core router and like the researchers find that it still contains the previous owner's information Eset recommends disconnecting the router and moving it to a secured area and contacting your regional CISA office They also say it's best to document your purchase process as a precaution for insurance or legal purposesCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and

and Security Service of Ukraine SSU likely conducted by APT group GamaredonOn February 09 2023 EclecticIQ analysts identified a spear phishing campaign targeting Ukrainian government entities like the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine SZRU and Security Service of Ukraine SSU Analysts identified a publicly exposed Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP server and assess with high confidence that the threat actor used the SMTP server to craft and deliver phishing emails The SMTP server contained a web panel designed to create and distribute spear phishing emails It enables the email to have a malicious attachment and leverages email spoofing techniques to make it appear from a legitimate sourceObserved adversary tactics techniques and procedures TTPs victimology and infrastructure found in the SMTP server configuration overlap with previously identified Gamaredon activityGamaredon APT group is believed to be a Russian State-backed threat group linked to the Federal Security Service FSB Gamaredon is known for its cyberespionage activities primarily targeting Ukrainian government entities The group uses spear phishing emails and social engineering lures as a primary tacticThe threat actor used a generic web panel to craft and send phishing emails against Ukrainian government entities This allowed the actor to automate the malware delivery process against specific targets entered by the attackers in the email recipient section of the panel's user interface Pivoted IP addresses overlap with previously reported Gamaredon activity 8 EclecticIQ analysts discovered a publicly facing SMTP server 19418019156 used in a spear phishing campaign against Ukrainian government entities in February 2023 The exposed SMTP server hosts a web panel for crafting and delivering spear phishing emails Analysts assess with high confidence that the threat actor used this infrastructure to send large number of spear phishing emails automatically Figure 1 shows two example phishing emails sent from the server Figure 1 - Example of phishing emails with malicious attachment sent in in February 2023EclecticIQ analysts identified these two different spear-phishing emails sent from 19418019156 Both of these emails contain a RAR archive file as an attachment which are used to deliver the initial malware Figures 2 and 3 showed two different malware execution flows sent on Wed 15 Feb 2023 171018 0200 and Wed 08 Feb 2023 171544 which are identical to previous Gamaredon campaigns 1Figure 2 - Spear phishing email sent on Wednesday 15 February 2023Figure 3 - Spear phishing email sent it on Wednesday 8 February 2023Figure 4 shows the origin of the phishing email and spoofed email address Figure 4 - Source of phishing emailThe server had port 80 open for use by the threat actor for crafting spear phishing emails via a simple user interface seen in figure 5 Figure 5 - Web panel translated from Russian to EnglishThe web panel allowed the threat actor to send emails using the hardcoded sender address pivn-krprokuraturadpua EclecticIQ analysts identified the same email address in a recent phishing email campaign sent to a Ukrainian military address on February 9 2023 5 indicating that the exposed panel was very likely used for malware deliveryEclecticIQ analysts identified that the htaccess file on the exposed SMTP server was misconfigured The htaccess file is a directory-level configuration to limit access to a web server from trusted IP addresses only According to the Apache documentation users must insert all IP filters inside the RequireAll tag 7 However this tag was missing in the configuration used by threat actorAnalysts identified five IP addresses in the htaccess file figure 6Figure 6 Reconnaissance with gobuster 6 and pivoting The majority of the pivoted IP addresses are located in Moscow Russia from the same server provider Crelcom LLC AS 6789 WHOIS records show that one of the IP addresses - 10920015946 - was registered under the name Michael Tishin The same name is also listed as registrant for another IP - 10920015954 This IP was attributed to Gamaredon by BlackBerry on January 19 2023 8The adversary TTPs and victimology overlap with Gamaredon activity previously reported by EclecticIQ and other researchers starting in 2020 1EclecticIQ analysts identified one IP address 10920015959 in the htaccess file that links to a spear phishing email submitted to VirusTotal on November 20 2020 In May 2022 Cisco reported the campaign and attributed the activity to Gamaredon 2 4Figure 7 shows the connection between the pivoted IP addresses and malicious files uploaded to VirusTotal The IP address links to a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment The attachments exploit CVE-2017-0199 a Microsoft Office remote code execution vulnerability in WindowsFigure 7 Link analysis for 10920015959Figure 8 shows that spear phishing email was sent to the Security Service of Ukraine SSU on November 19 2020 It contained a malicious Word document attachment used for malware delivery The email sender section was spoofed by threat actors to make the email look legitimateFigure 8 Content of the phishing emailFigure 9 displays the metadata of the spear phishing email The X-Sender-IP field in the metadata reveals the IP address 10920015959 of the sender This IP address does not match the domain name iua in the From field proving it is a spoofed emailFigure 9 Metadata section inside phishing emailOnce a victim opens the delivered malicious Word document it will exploit CVE-2017-0199 If the exploitation is successful then it will download a second-stage malware from the domain erythrocephalaonline which has been attributed to GamaredonEclecticIQ analysts assess with high confidence that Russian government-linked APTs will continue to use social engineering tactics during cyberattacks against Ukraine Additionally they are expected to increasingly target NATO partners due to NATO's support of Ukraine during the Russian warIt is very likely that the threat actor will modify their TTPs to avoid detection that will increase their chances of success especially during the malware delivery stage"

Poseidon deployed by the APT-36 group also known as Transparent Tribe This Pakistan-based advanced persistent threat group is notorious for targeting Indian government organizations military personnel and defense contractorsTransparent Tribe used the Kavach authentication tool as a cover to deliver the Poseidon payload Kavach is a two-factor authentication 2FA solution provided by the Indian government for secure access to their email services Transparent Tribe created a backdoored version of Kavach to target Linux users working for Indian government agencies When a user interacts with the malicious version of Kavach the genuine login page is displayed to distract them Meanwhile the payload is downloaded in the background compromising the user's systemPoseidon is a second-stage payload malware associated with Transparent Tribe It is a general-purpose backdoor that provides attackers with a wide range of capabilities to hijack an infected host Its functionalities include logging keystrokes taking screen captures uploading and downloading files and remotely administering the system in various ways Primarily Poseidon is distributed through malicious websites disguised as legitimate Indian government sitesUptycs research found that the malware infrastructure such as malicious domains is linked to earlier APT-36 campaigns This highlights the group's continued focus on the aforementioned Indian targets Repercussions of this APT-36 attack could be significant leading to loss of sensitive information compromised systems financial losses and reputational damageMoreover as the Transparent Tribe is thought to be state-sponsored its activities could escalate tensions between nations potentially resulting in retaliatory cyberattacks This highlights the importance of implementing robust cybersecurity measures and remaining vigilant against the ever-evolving threat landscapeAPT-36 aka Transparent Tribe primarily targets Indian government organizations military personnel and defense contractors Its objective is usually to gather sensitive information conduct cyber espionage and compromise the security of its targetsAPT-36 is known to have exploited various platforms including Windows and Android The bad actors often create fake websites and documents that mimic legitimate government entities or organizations This can trick targeted users into revealing their credentials or downloading malware onto their systems It has also used custom-developed malware such as the Crimson RAT remote access trojan for cyber espionageUsers can protect

found the apps to be total dummies it doesnt even work properly to keep victims engaged with the app for the purpose of chatting After further analysis it was found that both samples are highly obfuscated and codes are scattered to make the analyses difficult The app is similar to other malicious apps used in previous campaigns which are more than one year old The malicious app leverages Googles firebase for a command-and-control serverOur analysis of the obtained samples revealed the presence of encrypted strings Specifically in the Android samples from the previous campaign the strings were encrypted using a layer of the Base64 algorithm However in the current sample the team analyzed we found that the strings were encrypted with two layers of encryption Base64 and AES256 with CBC mode and PKCS padding The code was obfuscated and protected using Pro Guard making it difficult to understand Overall our technical analysis points to the DoNot APT as the perpetrator of this attack which is consistent with their past targeting of entities in the Kashmir region of IndiaThe threat actor is active since 2016 and has been carrying out cyber strikes in the South Asian region There are some media articles reporting that the threat actor belongs to the Indian soil but we cannot confidently confirm if they belong to India or what interest they are currently serving In the past the threat actor has also targeted their adversary with spear phishing attacks from different target industries and regions The threat actor is known for their consistent attacks and the same was reflected when we observed two different apps in the victims mobile with different command and control servers belonging to DoNot APTThe attack is not surprising to the threat intelligence community as DoNot has previously targeted NGOs and other entities in the Kashmir area as well as other regions of India Bangladesh and Pakistan on multiple occasions The aim behind the attack is still unknown however with a medium level of confidence we can say that the threat actor could have employed a spear messaging attack The threat actor could have used WhatsApp or other chatting messengers for the initial stage of the social engineering attack to deliver the app Because apps were found in the download folder and it is only possible when delivered by a third-party file-sharing site Attaching the app directly to WhatsApp increases the chances of malicious apps getting detected but sending the app as a file attachment saves the file in the WhatsApp media location and not in the download folder which is the same with other chatting messengersUpon Installing the Android Malware Sample asks the victim to open the appAfter opening the App it asks the victim to enable the accessibility service shown below in the screenshot It shows the victim the same alert every time the app is opened until the victim enables itAfter Clicking on Ok the app takes the victim to the accessibility setting page where it asks the victim to enable Accessibility by clicking on Link Chat and turning the accessibility service on Also upon turning the accessibility on the app hides from the main menu and it restricts the victim from uninstalling the app to an extentBelow is a snippet from the Android Manifest file the malicious app tries to access most of the permissions to perform malicious tasksBelow are a few dangerous permissions described that malicious Android app accessesBelow is a screenshot of the files after decompiling the Android package using Bytecode Viewer The snippet shows scattered modules as part of obfuscationThe extract below is the code that interacts with the command-and-control server The command-and-control domain was encrypted with Base64 and AES256 with CBC mode and PKCS padding The decryption of the string revealed playstoreexyz domain The suspected IOC is a year old and belongs to the notorious Do Not APTThe snippet below is of the module where a class is used for encryption and decryption of the string using a secret keyThe below Snippet shows a module that is exploiting androidintentactionNEWOUTGOINGCALL and androidintentextraPHONENUMBER permission to monitor outgoing and incoming calls of the compromised victimsThe extract below shows that the module is storing call logs with a few other details such as time and duration in JSON Array and is ready to send it over to the command- and-control serverThe snippet below shows the module where it fetches GPS location if its turned on in the victims phoneThe screenshot below shows the module where Names and Numbers are extracted into Contactstxt and sent over to the command-and-control serverThe threat actor is constantly targeting individuals in the Kashmir region of India Their attack is not so sophisticated and the aim behind the attack is still unknown While compiling this report we have come across another sample that has a different name but the code used in this sample is similar to that of the previous samples analysed except for the command-and-control domain This domain is new and has not been flagged as a malicious IOC anywhere Also our analysis of almost two-year- old APKs has revealed that the string was encrypted only with Base64 algorithms whereas the samples obtained one year ago revealed that the string was encrypted using two layers of encryption including Base64 and AES256 with CBC mode and PKCS padding This indicates that the threat actor has been utilizing the same tactics and techniques for the past two years It is expected that the group will utilize similar and consistent tactics and techniques especially in the context of spear phishing via messaging to target their intended victimsIndicators of CompromiseMITRE ATTCK Technique DetectionCopyright

        "text": "Emphasis on stopping these largescale BEC attacks by defenders which have cost companies in excess of 43 billion over several years have forced hackers to shift gears say researchersInstead of compromising a corporate email account and targeting a top C-suite person hackers are simply signing up for QuickBooks and PayPal accounts for free and sending thousands of phony invoices with phony phone numbers to mid-level managers and purchasing people as well as attacking small businesses And it's working While they could not determine how much money hackers have made from this new approach since they just started tracking this new variant last fall the researchers said in the last two months they observed 160 emails using QuickBooks and more than 23000 using PayPal Todays research outlines how Avanan blocked a hacker's attempt to use a legitimate QuickBooks account to defraud a companyWhat's different is that the threat comes from legitimate sources said Jeremy Fuchs a cybersecurity researcher-analyst at Avanan Traditional BEC strategies rely on analyzing the text in a message and seeing if something is out of the ordinary It depends on looking at the sender's address and seeing if something is amiss which relies on the context of messages and sender history All of that gets thrown out the window Their previous communication with QuickBooks will look the same as this current campaign So you won't be able to rely on natural language processing anomalies or anything else It requires a new approachFuchs said for its part Avanan has phone number scam protection where the artificial intelligence does a scan and very quickly can detect a fraudulent 800 number They also have DLP on the back-end where the software will block an invoice from being paid so an admin can look over the invoice one last time to make sure that its a legitimate invoice that should get paidCompanies need to slow the process down said Fuchs In essence the old training of looking for a domain name error like QuickBox versus QuickBooks doesnt work anymore Managers must scrutinize every invoice more carefully Google the phone number to make sure its a legitimate business and as an extra line of defense use DLP to slow the process down and have the invoice checked before it gets paidIt will slow the process down but in the long run it will save companies money said Fuchs If it works once and prevents you from paying out a huge invoice its worth itRogue invoice fraud requires business teams to operate the correct checks and balances processes that cant always get solved with a quick tech solution said Andrew Barratt vice president at Coalfire Barratt added that these type of attacks are more impactful to small businesses that might not crosscheck purchase orders against an invoice before paying itIt does require an attacker to try invoicing for a mass market service so Id expect to see these going out posing as Office 365 subscription payments or something else that there's a high probability of being a service consumed by a business said Barratt Part of the defense here is just good accounts payable hygieneMake sure the invoice has the correct purchase order that the renewal dates are known and that the request for payment matches the expected time frame for an invoicePatrick Harr chief executive officer at SlashNext pointed out that this kind of trusted services compromise happens with all threats not just BEC Harr said its very popular with BEC malicious HTML attachment attacks and credential phishing attacks and thats why training is only one piece of a cybersecurity strategyHackers use SharePoint OneDrive AWS Hubspot QuickBooks PayPal to deliver attacks because they are coming from trusted domains and this increases the likelihood they will bypass traditional email technology that relies on blocklist and domain reputation plus it will look legitimate to employees with security training said Harr These threats move fast Thats because some technology can detect it but it might take hours or days to make it to a threat database Therefore its important to have technology that has anti-evasion technology and can perform real-time scans to ensure these threats are stopped before wreaking havoc on an organizationAvanans Fuchs added that hackers are incredibly adept at adjusting as defenders move to stop them So much money and technology have been put into defending earlier forms of BEC and many products have gotten good at stopping it said FuchsSo hackers have to adjust and they have here said Fuchs

        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather MERCURY is now tracked as Mango Sandstorm and DEV-1084 is now tracked as Storm-1084 Previous MERCURY attacks have been observed targeting on-premises environments however the impact in this case notably also included destruction of cloud resources Microsoft assesses that MERCURY likely worked in partnership with another actor that Microsoft tracks as DEV-1084 who carried out the destructive actions after MERCURYs successful operations had gained access to the target environmentMERCURY likely exploited known vulnerabilities in unpatched applications for initial access before handing off access to DEV-1084 to perform extensive reconnaissance and discovery establish persistence and move laterally throughout the network oftentimes waiting weeks and sometimes months before progressing to the next stage DEV-1084 was then later observed leveraging highly privileged compromised credentials to perform en masse destruction of resources including server farms virtual machines storage accounts and virtual networks and send emails to internal and external recipientsIn this blog post we detail our analysis of the observed actor activity and related tools We also share information to the community and industry partners on ways to detect these attacks including detection details of MERCURY and DEV-1084s tools in Microsoft 365 Defender Microsoft Defender for Identity Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint As with any observed nation-state actor activity Microsoft has directly notified targeted or compromised customers providing them with important information needed to secure their environmentsMicrosoft uses DEV- designations as a temporary name given to an unknown emerging or a developing cluster of threat activity allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activityThe link between the DEV-1084 cluster and MERCURY was established based on the following evidenceMicrosoft assesses that MERCURY gains access to the targets through remote exploitation of an unpatched internet-facing device MERCURY then handed off access to DEV-1084 It is not currently clear if DEV-1084 operates independently of MERCURY and works with other Iranian actors or if DEV-1084 is an effects based sub-team of MERCURY that only surfaces when MERCURY operators are instructed to carry out a destructive attackAfter gaining access the threat actors deploy several tools and leverage techniques to maintain persistence which provide effective and continued access to compromised devices such as the followingOnce the persistence is established the threat actors perform extensive discovery leveraging common native Windows tools and commands such as netstat and nltest Such reconnaissance activities were seen leveraged throughout the attack chainThe threat actors consistently perform extensive lateral movement actions using the acquired credentials within a targeted environment These actions mainly involvedAfter infecting the new devices the threat actors often installed the same persistence mechanisms as described above Interestingly after each main attack step the actors did not always immediately continue their operations but would wait weeks and sometimes months before moving to the next stepIn observed activity the threat actors leveraged highly privileged credentials and access to domain controllers on on-premises destructive operations to prepare for large-scale encryption of targeted devicesTo do so they first interfered with security tools using Group Policy Objects GPO With defenses impaired the threat actors proceeded to stage the ransomware payload in the NETLOGON shares on several domain controllersGPO was leveraged again to register a scheduled task used to launch the ransomware payload Finally the ransomware payload encrypted files found on the file system of the targeted devices by changing the file name extension to DARKBIT and dropped ransom notesTo move from on-premises to the cloud the threat actors had to first compromise two privileged accounts and leverage them to manipulate the Azure Active Directory Azure AD Connect agent Two weeks before the ransomware deployment the threat actors first used a compromised highly privileged account to access the device where the AzureActiveDirectory Azure AD Connect agent is installed We assess with high confidence that the threat actors then used the AADInternals tool to extract the plaintext credentials of a privileged Azure AD account The threat actors then used these credentials to pivot from the on-premises environment to the Azure AD environmentShortly before the ransomware deployment we observed authentication from a known attacker IP address into the Azure AD Connector cloud account Investigating this sign-in showed that the threat actors were able to access the account on the first attempt without any guessing or modification of the password indicating that the actors possessed the password for this account The Azure AD Connector account is configured with single-factor authentication making it easier for the attacker to gain entry and elevate privilegesOn the day of the ransomware attack the threat actors executed multiple actions in the cloud using two privileged accounts The first account was the compromised Azure AD Connector account which had Global Administrator permissions as it was set up for an old solution DirSync For the second account which also had Global Administrator permissions the threat actors leveraged RDP for access into the account Even though this account had MFA in place the threat actors accessed it through RDP which is an open session that evades MFA blocking their activitiesThe actors went on to provide an existing legitimate OAuth application with both the fullaccessasapp permission and administrator consent which granted the threat actors full access to mailboxes through Exchange Web ServicesWith the obtained cloud administrator privileges the threat actors updated the OAuth application with certificates to conduct malicious activities These newly added credentials could then be used to issue access tokens and authenticate on behalf of the application to access cloud resourcesThe threat actors used the compromised administrator account to grant SMTP Send on behalf permissions to the Azure AD Connector account over a high-ranking employees mailbox using the Set-Mailbox PowerShell cmdletEmails were then created and sent both internally and externallyThe timeline below summarizes the sequence of eventsThe techniques used by the actors and described in this blog can be mitigated by adopting the following security measuresRecommendations to secure your on-prem environmentRecommendations to secure your Azure AD environmentIn addition the following alert can help detect compromised Azure AD Connect accountsMonitor medium and high severity alerts for highly privileged accounts as they can indicate malicious activity For exampleThe following Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts can indicate associated threat activityFor relevant accounts with Honeytoken configured the following alert can indicate malicious activityMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint alerts with the following titles can indicate possible presence of the indicators of compromise

threat hunting content that customers can use to detect the post exploitation activity detailed in this blog in addition to Microsoft Defender detections list aboveThe below list provides IOCs observed during our investigation We encourage our customers to investigate these indicators in their environments and implement detections and protections to identify past related activity and prevent future attacks against their systemsNOTE These indicators should not be considered exhaustive for this observed activityAt the CYBERWARCON 2023 conference Microsoft and LinkedIn analysts are presenting several sessions detailing analysis across multiple sets of threat actors and related activity demonstrating Microsoft Threat Intelligences ongoing efforts to track threat actors protect customers and share information with the wider security communityMicrosoft has been tracking activity related to the financially motivated threat actor Octo Tempest whose evolving campaigns represent a growing concern for many organizations across multiple industriesUser containment is a unique and innovative defense mechanism that stops human-operated attacks in their tracks Weve added user containment to the automatic attack disruption capability in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint User containment is automatically triggered by high-fidelity signals and limits attackers ability to move laterally within a network regardless of the compromised accounts Active Directory state or privilege levelSince February 2023 Microsoft has observed a high volume of password spray attacks attributed to Peach Sandstorm an Iranian nation-state group In a small number of cases Peach Sandstorm successfully authenticated to an account and used a combination of publicly available and custom tools for

        "text": "A state-backed group believed to be operating out of the Palestinian territories targeted local organizations in a campaign that began in September 2022 and lasted until at least February 2023Researchers from Symantec have been tracking a cyber-espionage group they call Mantis but is also referred to as Arid Viper The group has been active since at least 2014 and has been known to target organizations in Israel and several other Middle Eastern countriesBrigid O Gorman a senior intelligence analyst with Symantecs Threat Hunter Team told Recorded Future News that the campaign did not target human rights organizations or government bodies but could not offer more information about who the victims wereThis attack campaign had all the hallmarks of cyber-espionage activity Mantis is known to have launched cyber-espionage campaigns in the past and in this campaign we see them deploying a custom data exfiltration tool to exfiltrate data from victim networks alongside the updated versions of their custom Arid Gopher and Micropsia backdoors so all signs point towards this being espionage activity she saidO Gorman said that while it might be unusual to see a Palestinian-based group go after Palestinian targets it isnt unprecedented and APT groups often target victims in their own countriesThis targeting is not unprecedented for Mantis itself and Symantec previously uncovered attacks against individuals located in the Palestinian territories during 2017 she saidThe group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices they wrote While other vendors have linked the group to Hamas Symantec cannot make a definitive attribution to any Palestinian organizationThe group has in the past targeted a wide range of organizations connected to governments militaries and companies in the financial media education and energy sectorsSymantec said in the latest attacks on Palestinian organizations the group used updated versions of tools it has previously deployed that enabled extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen dataOne thing that stood out to O Gorman was a case where a compromised organization found the attackers deploying three different versions of the same tools on three different groups of computers The tactics show the group is pretty dedicated she said noting that it was an example of the steps the group takes to maintain persistence on victim machinesThey're effectively mounting three separate attacks against one organization she said Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure If one toolset was discovered the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the targets network the researchers wroteThe first evidence of activity was on December 18 when the threat actors first started their attack The next day the hackers used a tool to steal credentials before downloading a backdoor and upgrading their access to the organizations networkThroughout December and January the group installed other backdoors and tools to expand their access to data and moreThe group deployed the Arid Gopher malware which they appear to regularly update and rewrite in order to evade detection One version of the malware was vastly different from previous versions meaning the hackers are spending significant amounts of time to update their toolsMantis appears to be a determined adversary willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success as evidenced by extensive malware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks against single organizations into multiple separate strands to reduce the chances of the entire operation being detected the researchers saidFacebook added that the campaign targeted the Palestinian community but also individuals living in Syria Turkey Iraq Lebanon and Libya In total Facebook said it identified 10 Android malware strains two iOS malware hashes eight desktop malware strains and 179 domains used by Arid Viper in attacks that were carried out via Facebook accounts and other servicesJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014 Before moving back to New York City he worked for news outlets in South Africa Jordan and Cambodia He previously covered cybersecurity at ZDNet and TechRepublic Copyright 2023 The Record from Recorded Future News"

        "text": "Discovered during a response to a cyberattack against a US company Rorschach is deployed using a DLL side-loading component of a Cortex XDR Dump Service Tool a signed commercial security product Check Point reported the vulnerability to Trend MicroThe abuse of the legitimate Cortex XDR Dump Service Tool is particularly concerning as it uses vulnerable software to load malicious DLLs that provides persistence and evasion capabilitiesJon Miller Halcyon CEO and co-founder told SC Media in an emailed statement DLL-sideloading is not new but it is somewhat rare Check Points analysis of the cyberattack confirmed Rorschach is unique and shares no overlapping characteristics that prevent easy attribution to any other known ransomware variantsThe threat actor didnt hide behind any alias and appears to have no affiliation to any of the known ransomware groups researchers wrote Those two facts rarities in the ransomware ecosystem piqued our interest and prompted us to thoroughly analyze the newly discovered malwareWhile it seems to have taken inspiration from some of the most infamous ransomware families it also contains unique functionalities rarely seen among ransomware such as the use of direct syscalls they addedIts also highly customizable In addition to its high speed of encryption the variant bears a number of characteristics of particular concernThe strain is partly autonomous automatically running tasks that ransomware actors would typically perform manually during deployment For one it creates domain group policies on the Windows Domain Controller without human interaction Past interactions of LockBit leveraged similar functionality but Rorschachs deployment is differentFor example it creates multiple group policies one that copies itself into the public folder of all workstations on the victims network another that attempts to kill a list of predefined processes and a third that registers a scheduled task that immediately runs Once a user logs on the main executable is deployed with the relevant argumentsIn short the extremely flexible variant can automatically spread when deployed on the domain controller and clears the event logs of impacted devices It operates a built-in configuration and on numerous optional arguments that allow it to modify its tactics based on the operators needsAs observed by Check Point in the wild Rorschach executes using the Cortex XDR Dump Service Tool version 73016740 as well as winutilsdll a packed loader and injector used to both decrypt and inject the ransomwareThe variant also uses configini which contains all the logic and configuration of the encrypted ransomware Researchers noted that this is the main payload subsequently loaded into memoryas well as decrypted and injected into notepadexe where the ransomware logic beginsEven its spawning processes are uncommon as it runs in suspend mode and gives out falsified arguments that makes it difficult for network defenders to analyze and remediateThe falsified argument is a repeating string of the digit one based on the length of the real argument rewritten in memory and replaced with the real argument resulting in a unique execution researchers explainedFor Miller the most interesting feature of Rorschach is not its speed but its advanced security evasion capabilities that makes the payload delivery undetectable which is highly concerningWith fast encryption once the ransomware payload is delivered and the operation is exposed responders have less time to intervene said Miller RaaS providers tout their encryption speed to attract affiliate attackers and it definitely makes this ransomware strain one to watchDetection of DLL side-loading attacks can be difficult As such analysts should look for unsigned DLLs within executable files or suspicious loading paths and timestamps that show gaps between the compilation time for the executable and DLL loading timeThe voice

        "text": "The Mantis cyber-espionage group aka Arid Viper Desert Falcon APT-C-23 a threat actor believed to be operating out of the Palestinian territories is continuing to mount attacks deploying a refreshed toolset and going to great lengths to maintain a persistent presence on targeted networksMantis has been active since at least 2014 with some third-party reporting suggesting it may have been active as early as 2011 The group is known to target organizations in Israel and a number of other Middle Eastern countries Sectors targeted include government military financial media education energy and think tanks The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devicesIn its most recent attacks the group used updated versions of its custom Micropsia and Arid Gopher backdoors to compromise targets before engaging in extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen dataThe initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown In one organization targeted a feature of the compromise was that the attackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset ie different variants of the same tools on three groups of computers Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure If one toolset was discovered the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the targets networkThe following is a description of how one of those three toolsets was usedThe first evidence of malicious activity occurred on December 18 2022 Three distinct sets of obfuscated PowerShell commands were executed to load a Base64-encoded string which started embedded shellcodeThe shellcode was a 32-bit stager that downloaded another stage using basic TCP-based protocol from a command-and-control CC server 10419422250 port 4444Micropsia subsequently executed and initiated contact with a CC server On the same day Micropsia also executed on three other machines in the same organization In each case it ran in a folder named after its file nameOn one computer Micropsia was used to set up a reverse socks tunnel to an external IP

Gopher backdoor on three infected computers Arid Gopher was in turn used to run a tool called SetRegRunKeyexe that provided persistence by adding Arid Gopher to the registry so that it executed on reboot It also ran an unknown file named localsecuritypolicyexe this file name was used for the Arid Gopher backdoor elsewhere by the attackersOn December 28 Micropsia was used to run windowspackagesexe on three more infected computersOn December 31 Arid Gopher executed two unknown files named networkswitcherdatamodellexe and networkuefidiagsbootserverexe on two of the infected computersOn January 2 the attackers retired the version of Arid Gopher they were using and introduced a new variant Whether this was because the first version was discovered or whether it was standard operating procedure is unclearOn January 4 Micropsia was used to execute two unknown files both named hostupbrokerexe on a single computer from the folder csidlcommonappdatahostupbrokerhostupbrokerexe

        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories03 Apr 2023 minute readAuthorsOn March 29 Crowdstrike published a report about a supply chain attack conducted via 3CXDesktopApp a popular VoIP program Since then the security community has started analyzing the attack and sharing their findings The following has been discovered so farOver the years we observed few victims compromised with Gopuram but the number of infections began to increase in March 2023 As it turned out the increase was directly related to the 3CX supply chain attack We found out that the threat actor specifically targeted cryptocurrency companies dropping the following files on infected machinesThe wlbsctrldll library is responsible for decrypting and executing the shellcode stored in the CWindowsSystem32configTxR directory The decryption is notably performed through the CryptUnprotectData API function that uses a different encryption key internally on every machine This makes it difficult for researchers to decrypt the payload from the file without physical access to the victim machinesSnippet of the loading function using CryptUnprotectDataThe component loaded by the library is Gopurams main module As mentioned above its name in the export directory is guard64dll The job of the main module is to connect to a C2 server and request commands The backdoor implements commands that allow the attackers to interact with the victims file system and create processes on the infected machine Gopuram was additionally observed to launch in-memory modules Just like the implants used in the 3CX campaign Gopurams modules are DLL files that include an export function named DllGetClassObject We have observed nine modules so farThe discovery of the new Gopuram infections allowed us to attribute the 3CX campaign to the Lazarus threat actor with medium to high confidence Our attribution is based on the following factsWhile investigating an attack on a Southeast Asian cryptocurrency company in 2020 we found Gopuram coexisting on the same machine with the AppleJeus backdoor which is attributed to LazarusThe Gopuram backdoor has been observed in attacks on cryptocurrency companies which is aligned with the interests of the Lazarus threat actorFirst bytes of the loader shellcode used in 3CX and AppleJeusNote though that the shellcode is based on open-source code that has been used by other threat actors for example SilentBreak Still the use of that shellcode along with the 0xF558F4DA constant which is the ROR13 hash for the string DllGetClassObject is a more unique patternThe dll library dropped from the MSI was observed to launch an in-memory payload that contacts the oilycargocom domain This domain name has previously been attributed to Lazarus by multiple researchersIn our telemetry we observed AvBugReportexe the executable hosting dll to contain Gopurams main module payload guard64dllThese four facts allow us to conclude that Lazarus is likely the threat actor deploying the Gopuram backdoorAs for the victims in our telemetry installations of the infected 3CX software are located all over the world with the highest infection figures observed in Brazil Germany Italy and FranceAs the Gopuram backdoor has been deployed to less than ten infected machines it indicates that attackers used Gopuram with surgical precision We additionally observed that the attackers have a specific interest in cryptocurrency companiesAs it turns out the infostealer is not the only malicious payload deployed during the 3CX supply chain attack The threat actor behind Gopuram additionally infects target machines with the full-fledged modular Gopuram backdoor We believe that Gopuram is the main implant and the final payload in the attack chain Our investigation of the 3CX campaign is still far from complete We will continue analyzing the deployed implants to find out more details about the toolset used in the supply chain attackMD5

        "text": "Nearly all 986 hospital websites leverage third-party tracking code that routinely transfers patient data to large technology companies social media giants advertising firms and data brokers in likely violation of federal privacy laws according to new research published in Health AffairsHospitals are facilitating the profiling of their patients by third parties researchers wrote These practices can lead to dignitary harms which occur when third parties gain access to sensitive health information that a person would not wish to shareResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon used descriptive statistics and regression analysis to determine the hospital characteristics tied to a greater number of third-party data transfers and found trackers on health systems hospitals affiliated with medical schools and hospitals serving more urban patient populations Nearly all of these provider organizations exposed visitors to higher levels of tracking through the use of third-party tracking code on their websites In doing so patients are likely seeing an increase in targeted health-related advertisingWhile the 2022 pixel research confirmed the prevalence of third-party tracking on health-related websites the researchers sought to understand the quantity and characteristics of these tools given that for many patients these websites are an essential point of contact to the health systemThe researchers examined all US hospitals or 6162 websites including 3747 identified non-federal acute care hospitals with accessible websites Nearly all had at least one third-party data transfer and 943 had at least one third-party cookieThe most common tracking entity among these hospitals was Alphabet the parent company of Google with 985 of all home pages reporting third-party transfers Meta was the second most common third-party with 556 of all transfers followed by Adobe Systems 314 and ATT 246Notably the researchers found that 69 of hospital homepages transferred data to third-party domains of which the parent company could not be identifiedHospitals in health systems hospitals with a medical school affiliation and hospitals serving more urban patient populations all exposed website visitors to more third-party data transfers according to the reportWhats more a manual search of 100 randomly sampled hospital websites tied to six potentially sensitive conditions yielded 30 websites with patient-facing pages for all six conditions and every single one of these pages had at least one third-party data transfer Researchers found similar tracking on hospitals homepagesThe amount of tracking on condition-specific pages was highly correlated with tracking on the homepage of the same hospital researchers wroteWhats more the researchers found a high number of entities transferring data to third parties as part of their business models built on identifying and tracking people for the purposes of targeting online advertisementsFor example Alphabet doesnt sell data to third parties but allows targeted advertising through profiles including the targeted promotion of prescription drugs While less prevalent companies have practices that have allowed lists of patients with certain disease types and their data including their contact information to be available for purchaseBecause little is known about the precise ways in which third parties use tracking data the implications of extensive third-party tracking on hospital websites remain unknown but are potentially far reaching researchers wrote Health-related information inferred from browsing behavior also may be incorporated into risk scoresPatients who visit hospital websites may see greater levels of online targeted advertisement for pharmaceuticals medical supplements and insurance products that potentially conflict with best practices or the advice of their physician drive low-value health care spending or substitute for more effective cures they continuedThe use of Pixels and other tracking tools are increasing the legal liability for hospitals as well Within the last year hospitals that have reported inadvertent disclosures of patient data to third-party brokers have been promptly met with lawsuits from the affected patientsBut before the risk of pixel-tracking tools was broadly exposed Mass General Brigham and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute settled with a group of patients for 18 million to resolve claims these hospital networks did not gain consent to use third-party tracking tools like cookies and tracking pixels on their public-facing websitesWhats clear is that hospital policy makers need to address tracking use on health-related websites including auditing webpages to either limit or eliminate third-party tracking If a decision is made to continue use of these tools hospitals must clearly disclose it on the website and give patients the ability to opt out of the process

hasalso dropped a second-stage backdoor on systems belonging to a small number of themThe backdoor called Gopuram contains multiple modules that the threat actors can use to exfiltrate data install additional malware start stop and delete services and interact directly with victim systems Researchers from Kaspersky spotted the malware on a handful of systems running compromised versions of 3CX DesktopAppIn a blog post on April 3 Kaspersky concluded that the attack on 3CX was therefore also very likely the work of the same outfit The discovery of the new Gopuram infections allowed us to attribute the 3CX campaign to the Lazarus threat actor with medium to high confidence Kaspersky saidKaspersky researcher Georgy Kucherin says the purpose of the backdoor is to conduct cyber espionage Gopuram is a second-stage payload dropped by the attackers to spy on target organizations he saysKaspersky's discovery of second-stage malware adds another wrinkle to the attack on 3CX a provider of videoconferencing PBX and business communication app for Windows macOS and Linux systems The company has claimed that some 600000 organizations worldwide with more than 12 million daily users currently use its 3CX DesktopAppTheir investigations showed that a threat actor now identified as the Lazarus Group had compromised two dynamic link libraries DLLs in the application's installation package added malicious code to them The weaponized apps ended on user systems via automatic updates from 3CX and also via manual updatesOnce on a system the signed 3CX DesktopApp executes the malicious installer which then initiates a series of steps that ends with an information-stealing malware getting installed on the compromised system Multiple security researchers have noted that only an attacker with a high level of access to 3CX's development or build environment would have been able to introduce malicious code to the DLLs and get away unnoticed3CX has hired Mandiant to investigate the incident and has said it will release more details of what exactly transpired once it has all the detailsLazarus Group also apparently used a 10-year-old bugto add malicious code to a Microsoft DLL without invalidating the signatureIn its 2103 vulnerability disclosure Microsoft had described the flaw as giving attackers a way to add malicious code to a signed executable without invalidating the signature The company's update for the issue changed how binaries signed with Windows Authenticode are verified Basically the update ensured that if someone made changes to an already signed binary Windows would no longer recognize the binary as signedIn announcing the update back then Microsoft also made it an opt-in update meaning users didn't have to apply the update if they had concerns about the stricter signature verification causing problems in situations where they might have made custom changes to installersMicrosoft was reluctant for a time to make this patch official says Jon Clay vice president of threat intelligence at Trend Micro What is being abused by this vulnerability in essence is a scratch-pad space at the end of the file Think of it like a cookie flag that many applications have been allowed to use like some Internet browsersBrigid OGorman senior intelligence analyst with Symantec's Threat Hunter team says the company's researchers did see the 3CX attackers appending data to the end of a signed Microsoft DLL It worth noting that what gets added to the file is encrypted data that needs something else to turn it into malicious code O'Gorman says In this case the 3CX application sideloads the ffmpegdll file which reads the data appended to the end of the file and then decrypts it into code that calls out to an external command-and-control C2 server she notesI think the best advice for organizations at the moment would be to apply Microsoft's patch for CVE-2013-3900 if they have not already done so O'Gorman saysNotably organizations that might have patched the vulnerability when Microsoft first issued an update for it would need to do so again if they have Windows 11 That's because the newer OS undid the effect of the patch Kucherin and other researchers sayCVE-2013-3900 was used by the second-stage DLL in an attempt to hide from security applications that only check against a digital signature for validity Clay says Patching would help security products flag the file for analysis he notesWilliam Dormann senior vulnerability analyst at Analygence says theattackers in the 3CX incidentused CVE-2013-3900 to plant shellcode in a digitally signed binary and banked on the malware slipping past analysts because it wasdigitally signed Users who have applied the mitigation for CVE-2013-3900 would not have been protected in any way whatsoever against the 3CX malware on an otherwise default configuration of Windows he saysNo Windows platform includes a fix for CVE-2013-3900 at this point in time It remains strictly optional He also notes that with GitHub taking down the payload files attackers had stored on it there's nothing more users can do to protect against the threatA Microsoft spokesman said an attacker would be able toadd code to a signed DLL only if they had alreadycompromised the code via a third-party As a best practice we encourage customers to apply all the latest security updates for better protection the spokesman saidIn addition Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender antivirus can detect and block the domains and files involved with this threat the spokesman added Microsoft did not directly address a Dark Reading question on why the company had decided to make the fix for CVE-2013-3900 Instead the spokesman pointed to Microsoft's original security advisory on the bug Regarding CVE-2013-3900 updates specifically we recommend customers assess their system environment and follow the steps and suggested actions outlined in the security advisory the spokesman saidThis story was
