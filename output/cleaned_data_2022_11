        "text": "Three vulnerabilities have been disclosed affecting operational technology OT products from two German companies factory automation manufacturer Festo and automation software company CODESYSThese vulnerabilities affect hundreds of industrial devices in the supply chain The most severe one enables denial of service and is trivially easy to execute either by visiting a hidden web page by or by using a text-based browser toolThe three vulnerabilities are FSCT-2022-0072 affecting CODESYS V3 as well as CVE-2022-3079 and CVE-2022-3270 which affect Festo automation controllersForescouts Head of Security Research Daniel dos Santos said CODESYS CVE-2022-4048 stands out because it shows that even in recent and popular implementations of cryptography in OT systems there are some basic mistakesThe use of insecure pseudo-random number generators a null initialization vector and the insecure mode of operation ECB are all well-known cryptographic pitfalls that should have been avoided in a product used by many critical OT devices he saidDos Santos noted that with the help of Festo they also discovered that known vulnerabilities CVE-2022-31806 and CVE-2022-22515 affected several Festo programmable logic controllers PLCs industrial computers used to control automation because they shipped with an unsafe configuration of the CODESYS runtime environmentHe suggested IT teams focus on remediating these issues because many other device manufacturers may be integrating CODESYS insecurely in their products and either are not aware of this or have not made their customers aware with a specific security advisoryThe most concerning of the bugs according to dos Santos is CVE-2022-3270 which allows for sensitive commands to be run without authentication on some Festo PLCsThis once again shows that there are many proprietary OT protocols out there that allow anybody on the network to take control of a PLCIn most cases these are legacy protocols designed at a time where security was not a major concern for OT but they are still used in critical facilities around the worldCODESYS has sold more than 8 million device licenses most to manufacturers of programmable automation components and controllers like Festo Its automation suite runs on some 1000 models of more than 500 manufacturers Forescout saysThese devices are used in industries such as manufacturing energy automation and building automation Although these devices are typically not supposed to be exposed online we see almost 3000 devices running CODESYS when querying the Shodan search engine the researchers saidFesto meanwhile is a seller of pneumatic and electrical control systems and drive technology for factories and process automation across 61 countries with billions in annual sale revenueOn the Forescout Device Cloud a repository of data from 19 million devices monitored by Forescout appliances the researchers saw close to 1000 Festo controllers used overwhelmingly within manufacturingForescout disclosed the bugs to the affected companies as well as CERTVDE a German security platform for small and medium-sized automation companies The researchers said that like those disclosures these new issues exemplify either an insecure-by-design approach where manufacturers include dangerous functions that can be accessed with no authentication or a subpar implementation of security controls such as cryptographyThe main issue Forescout found with CODESYS V3 is that session keys are generated using an insecure pseudo-random number generator PRNG working off a small and predictable seedAccording to the researchers an attacker can simply brute force the session key to decrypt the downloaded code for manipulationThe code is encrypted in ECB mode without additional cryptographic authentication and integrity over the ciphertext as a whole This means that both confidentiality and integrity are compromised regardless of session key strength the researchers saidThe impact is that an attacker can trivially decrypt and manipulate protected codeThe other issues concerned several ways to reboot Festo programmable logic controllers PLCs without authenticationAny one of these methods would allow an attacker with network access to target the device and cause a denial of service conditionAn attacker could also use the reboot command in the PLC Browser tool a text-based monitor for controllers running CODESYS which allows an operator to issue several commands to the monitored controllersTobias Pfeiffer head of Festo's Product Security Incident Response Team told The Record that CVE-2022-3079 only concerned the CPX-CEC-C1 and CPX-CMXX products with the latter being phased out after discontinuation in 2015 Pfeiffer noted that there are replacements available for CPX-CEC-C1Forescout said protection against these vulnerabilities requires patching devices running the vulnerable firmware FSCT-2022-0072 replacing them with newer equipment CVE-2022-3079 or changing default configurations CVE-2022-31806 and CVE-2022-22515The researchers also suggested firms create an inventory of vulnerable devices and enforce segmentation controls isolating tools that cannot be patched immediatelyAccording to dos Santos the problems may extend beyond what Forescout found on ShodanJust like Festo has FGMC and other vendors have other insecure engineering protocols that we reported on the original OTICEFALL disclosure there certainly are many other instances of this that are not yet public knowledge he

active campaign exfiltrate contacts SMS messages recorded phone calls and even chat messages from apps such as Signal Viber and Telegram23 Nov 2022 11 min readESET researchers have identified an active campaign targeting Android users conducted by the Bahamut APT group This campaign has been active since January 2022 and malicious apps are distributed through a fake SecureVPN website that provides only Android apps to download Note that although the malware employed throughout this campaign uses the name SecureVPN it has no association whatsoever with the legitimate multiplatform SecureVPN software and serviceKey points of this blogpostThe app used has at different times been a trojanized version of one of two legitimate VPN apps SoftVPN or OpenVPN which have been repackaged with Bahamut spyware code that the Bahamut group has used in the pastWe were able to identify at least eight versions of these maliciously patched apps with code changes and updates being made available through the distribution website which might mean that the campaign is well maintainedThe main purpose of the app modifications is to extract sensitive user data and actively spy on victims messaging appsWe believe that targets are carefully chosen since once the Bahamut spyware is launched it requests an activation key before the VPN and spyware functionality can be enabled Both the activation key and website link are likely sent to targeted usersWe do not know the initial distribution vector email social media messaging apps SMS etcThe malware is able to exfiltrate sensitive data such as contacts SMS messages call logs device location and recorded phone calls It can also actively spy on chat messages exchanged through very popular messaging apps including Signal Viber WhatsApp Telegram and Facebook Messenger the data exfiltration is done via the keylogging functionality of the malware which misuses accessibility services The campaign appears to be highly targeted as we see no instances in our telemetry dataThe Bahamut APT group typically targets entities and individuals in the Middle East and South Asia with spearphishing messages and fake applications as the initial attack vector Bahamut specializes in cyberespionage and we believe that its goal is to steal sensitive information from its victims Bahamut is also referred to as a mercenary group offering hack-for-hire services to a wide range of clients The name was given to this threat actor which appears to be a master in phishing by the Bellingcat investigative journalism group Bellingcat named the group after the enormous fish floating in the vast Arabian Sea mentioned in the Book of Imaginary Beings written by Jorge Luis Borges Bahamut is frequently described in Arabic mythology as an unimaginably enormous fishThe group has been the subject of several publications in recent years includingThe initial fake SecureVPN app we analyzed was uploaded to VirusTotal on 2022-03-17 from an IP address that geolocates to Singapore along with a link to a fake website that triggered one of our YARA rulesThe malicious Android application used in this campaign was delivered via the website thesecurevpncom see Figure 1 which uses the name but none of the content or styling of the legitimate SecureVPN service at the domain securevpncomFigure 1 Fake SecureVPN website provides a trojanized app to download Figure 2 Free website template used to create the distribution website for the fake VPN appthesecurevpncom was registered on 2022-01-27 however the time of initial distribution of the fake SecureVPN app is unknown The malicious app is provided directly from the website and has never been available at the Google Play storeFigure 3 Class name comparison between the earlier malicious SecureChat package left and fake SecureVPN package rightComparing Figure 4 and Figure 5 you can see the similarities in SQL queries in the earlier SecureChat malware attributed to Bahamut and the fake SecureVPN malwareFigure 4 The SQL queries used in malicious code from the earlier SecureChat campaignFigure 5 The SQL queries used in malicious code in the fake SecureVPN campaignAs such we believe that the fake SecureVPN application is linked to the Bahamut groupSince the distribution website has been online there have been at least eight versions of the Bahamut spyware available for download These versions were created by the threat actor where the fake application name was followed by the version number We were able to pull the following versions from the server where we believe the version with the lowest version suffix was provided to potential victims in the past while more recently higher version numbers secureVPN104apk SecureVPN105apk SecureVPN106apk SecureVPN107apk SecureVPN108apk SecureVPN109apk SecureVPN1010apk secureVPN1010bapk have been usedWe divide these versions into two branches since Bahamuts malicious code was placed into two different legitimate VPN appsFigure 6 Fake SecureVPN v104 with malicious code included into SoftVPN as parent applicationFigure 7 Fake SecureVPN v109 SecureVPN109 with malicious code included into OpenVPN as its parent application even though the hardcoded VERSIONNAME 100 wasnt changed between versionsBesides the split in these two branches where the same malicious code is implanted into two different VPN apps other fake SecureVPN version updates contained only minor code changes or fixes with nothing significant considering its overall functionalityThe reason why the threat actor switched from patching SoftVPN to OpenVPN as its parent app is not clear however we suspect that the reason might be that the legitimate SoftVPN app stopped working or being maintained and was no longer able to create VPN connections as confirmed by our testing of the latest SoftVPN app from Google Play This could be a reason for Bahamut to switch to using OpenVPN since potential victims might uninstall a non-working VPN app from their devices Changing one parent app to another likely required more time resources and effort to successfully implement by the threat actorMalicious code packaged with the OpenVPN app was implemented a layer above the VPN code That malicious code implements spyware functionality that requests an activation key and then checks the supplied key against the attackers CC server If the key is successfully entered the server will return a token that is necessary for successful communication between the Bahamut spyware and its CC server If the key is not correct neither Bahamut spyware nor VPN functionality will be enabled Unfortunately without the activation key dynamic malware analysis sandboxes might not flag it as a malicious appIn Figure 8 you can see an initial activation key request and in Figure 9 the network traffic behind such a request and the response from the CC serverFigure 8 Fake SecureVPN requests activation key before enabling VPN and spyware functionsFigure 9 Fake SecureVPN activation request and its CC servers responseThe campaigns using the fake SecureVPN app try to keep a low profile since the website URL is most likely delivered to potential victims with an activation key which is not provided on the website Unfortunately we were not able to obtain a working keyThe activation key layer does not belong to the original OpenVPN functionality and we do not recognize it as code from any other legitimate app We believe it was developed by Bahamut since it also communicates with their CC serverIf the Bahamut spyware is enabled then it can be remotely controlled by Bahamut operators and can exfiltrate various sensitive device data such asFigure 10 Fake SecureVPN request to manually enable Accessibility servicesAll exfiltrated data is stored in a local database and then sent to the CC server The Bahamut spyware functionality includes the ability to update the app by receiving a link to a new version from the CC serverThe mobile campaign operated by the Bahamut APT group is still active it uses the same method of distributing its Android spyware apps via websites that impersonate or masquerade as legitimate services as has been seen in the past Further the spyware code and hence its functionality is the same as in previous campaigns including collecting data to be exfiltrated in a local database before sending it to the operators server a tactic rarely seen in mobile cyberespionage appsIt appears that this campaign has maintained a low profile as we see no instances in our telemetry data This is probably achieved through highly targeted distribution where along with a link to the Bahamut spyware the potential victim is supplied an activation key which is required to enable the malwares spying

        "text": "The RansomExx ransomware group has become the latest gang to create a variant in the Rust programming language according to IBM Security X-Force Threat researchersCharlotte Hammond a malware reverse engineer for IBM Security X-Force told The Record the development was important because antivirus detection rates tend to be lower for Rust compiled malware making it easier to slip past defensesWhile switching languages may sound like a minor thing its not a trivial exercise Theyre not just making an update to their existing code base theyre recreating it from scratch in a completely new language with a completely different syntax and set of libraries Its likely to be a language that their developers are less familiar with too which will also add to the time and effort required she saidIn cases like this one the group already have an existing and well-established piece of ransomware yet they have decided that the benefits of the switch are worth the effortThe new sample is still only detected by 14 out of the 60 AV providers represented in the platform the researchers foundThe developers behind RansomExx also created the PyXie malware Vatet loader and Defray ransomware strains IBM explainedThe new variant named RansomExx2 is built to run on the Linux operating system but IBM noted that the group typically creates versions for Windows as wellEmsisoft ransomware expert Brett Callow said many other ransomware groups are using Rust and IBM added that many other ransomware groups have created their own Rust variants including high profile gangs like BlackCat Hive and ZeonThe Rust programming language has been steadily increasing in popularity among malware developers over the course of the past year thanks to its cross-platform support and low AV detection rates the researchers saidLike the Go programming language which has experienced a similar surge in usage by threat actors over the past few years Rusts compilation process also results in more complex binaries that can be more time-consuming to analyze for reverse engineersHammond added that the lower antivirus detection rates are the main reason most groups turn to languages like Rust explaining that every additional target that they can successfully execute the ransomware on without it being detected and quarantined by AV represents another possible source of incomeThe lower AV detection rates for Rust binaries can likely be explained by the language being much less commonly used so AV vendors will have fewer signatures for it and less available samples to train their detection applications with Hammond explainedIf the Rust language continues to be adopted by malware developers then this will eventually change as AV vendors will start increasing their abilities to detect it and so its advantages compared to other languages will lessen At that point we may see malware developers shift and start to experiment with different languages instead she saidIts for this reason as well that its important to highlight these language changes when they arise Raising awareness of the fact that more groups are adopting a new language will hopefully encourage security teams to research the matter and ensure they have the capabilities to detect and defend against itRecorded Future ransomware expert Allan Liska said two years ago there were a lot of stories about ransomware groups switching to Golang or new ransomware being developed in that languageLiska said that trend did not last for unknown reason but noted that many have switched to Rust as the programming language of choice for ransomware groupsRansomware is software and like any software it has to be updated regularly Ransomware groups switch to whatever platforms are going to help them be successful and one advantage of Rust is that it makes the ransomware harder to detect by AV products for now he saidThe security industry will catch up shortly and it becomes a cat and mouse game where the ransomware groups develop new methods to evade detection and AV and EDR vendors develop new and better detectionsJonathan Greig is a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News Jonathan has worked across the globe as a journalist since 2014 Before moving back to New York City he worked for news outlets in South Africa Jordan and Cambodia He previously covered cybersecurity at ZDNet and TechRepublic Copyright 2023 The Record from Recorded Future News"

        "text": "A financially motivated threat actor targeting individuals and organizations on Facebook's Ads and Business platform has resumed operations after a brief hiatus with a new bag of tricks for hijacking accounts and profiting from themThe Vietnam-based threat campaign dubbed Ducktail has been active since at least May 2021 and has affected users with Facebook business accounts in the United States and more than three dozen other countries Security researchers from WithSecure formerly F-Secure who are tracking Ducktail have assessed that the threat actor's primary goal is to push out ads fraudulently via Facebook business accounts to which they manage to gain controlWe believe the Ducktail operation uses hijacked business account access purely to make money by pushing out fraudulent ads says Mohammad Kazem Hassan Nejad a researcher at WithSecure IntelligenceIn situations where the threat actor gains access to the finance editor role on a compromised Facebook business account they also have the ability to modify business credit card information and financial details such as transactions invoices account spending and payment methods Nejad says This would allow the threat actor to add other businesses to the credit card and monthly invoices and use the linked payment methods to run adsThe hijacked business could therefore be used for purposes such as advertising fraud or even to spread disinformation Nejad says The threat actor could also use their newfound access to blackmail a company by locking them out of their own pageThe tactic of Ducktail's operators is to first identify organizations that have a Facebook Business or Ads account and then target individuals within those companies whom they perceive as having high-level access to the account Individuals the group has typically targeted include people with managerial roles or roles in digital marketing digital media and human resourcesThe attack chain starts with the threat actor sending the targeted individual a spear-phishing lure via LinkedIn or WhatsApp Users who fall for the lure end up having Ducktail's information stealer installed on their systemThe malware can carry out multiple functions including extracting all stored browser cookies and Facebook session cookies from the victim machine specific registry data Facebook security tokens and Facebook account informationThe malware steals a wide range of information on all businesses associated with the Facebook account including name verification stats ad spending limits roles invite link client ID ad account permissions permitted tasks and access status The malware collects similar information on any ad accounts associated with the compromised Facebook accountThe information stealer can steal information from the victim's Facebook account and hijack any Facebook Business account to which the victim has sufficient access by adding attacker-controlled email addresses into the business account with administrator privileges and finance editor roles Nejad says Adding an email address to a Facebook Business account prompts Facebook to send a link via email to that address which in this case is controlled by the attacker The threat actor uses that link to gain access to the account according to WithSecureThreat actors with admin access to a victim's Facebook account can do a lot of damage including taking full control of the business account viewing and modifying settings people and account details and even deleting the business profile outright Nejad says When a targeted victim might not have sufficient access to allow the malware to add the threat actors email addresses the threat has actor relied on the information exfiltrated from the victims machines and Facebook accounts to impersonate themNejad says that prior versions of Ducktail's information stealer contained a hard-coded list of email addresses to use for hijacking business accountsHowever with the recent campaign we observed the threat actor removing this functionality and relying entirely on fetching email addresses directly from its command-and-control channel C2 hosted on Telegram the researcher says Upon launch the malware establishes a connection to the C2 and waits for a duration of time to receive a list of attacker-controlled email addresses in order to proceed he addsThe report lists several steps that organization can take to mitigate exposure to Ducktail-like attack campaigns beginning with raising awareness of spear-phishing scams targeting users with access to Facebook business accountsOrganizations should also enforce application whitelisting to prevent unknown executables from running ensure that all managed or personal devices used with company Facebook accounts have basic hygiene and protection in place and use private browsing to authenticate each work session when accessing Facebook Business accountsCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is

        "text": "April 2023 update Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather DEV-0569 is now tracked as Storm-0569 Recent activity from the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as DEV-0569 known to distribute various payloads has led to the deployment of the Royal ransomware which first emerged in September 2022 and is being distributed by multiple threat actors Observed DEV-0569 attacks show a pattern of continuous innovation with regular incorporation of new discovery techniques defense evasion and various post-compromise payloads alongside increasing ransomware facilitationDEV-0569 notably relies on malvertising phishing links that point to a malware downloader posing as software installers or updates embedded in spam emails fake forum pages and blog comments In the past few months Microsoft security researchers observed the following tweaks in the groups delivery methodsThese methods allow the group to potentially reach more targets and ultimately achieve their goal of deploying various post-compromise payloads DEV-0569 activity uses signed binaries and delivers encrypted malware payloads The group also known to rely heavily on defense evasion techniques has continued to use the open-source tool Nsudo to attempt disabling antivirus solutions in recent campaignsIn this blog we share details of DEV-0569s tactics techniques and procedures TTPs and observed behavior in recent campaigns which show that DEV-0569 will likely continue leveraging malvertising and phishing for initial access We also share preventive measures that organizations can adopt to thwart DEV-0569s delivery methods involving malicious links and phishing emails using solutions like Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and to reduce the impact of the groups follow-on activities Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects the DEV-0569 behavior discussed in this blog including the code signing certificates in use and the attempts to disable Microsoft Defender AntivirusMicrosoft uses DEV- designations as a temporary name given to an unknown emerging or developing cluster of threat activity allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we can reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the actor behind the activity Once it meets defined criteria a DEV group is converted to a named actorDEV-0569 has multiple methods for delivery of their initial payload In some cases DEV-0569 payloads are delivered via phishing campaigns run by other malicious actors that offer delivery of malware payloads as a serviceFrom August to October 2022 Microsoft observed DEV-0569 activity where BATLOADER delivered via malicious links in phishing emails posed as legitimate installers for numerous applications like TeamViewer Adobe Flash Player Zoom and AnyDesk BATLOADER was hosted on attacker-created domains posing as legitimate software download sites anydeskoscom for example and on legitimate repositories like GitHub and OneDrive Microsoft takes down verified malicious content from these repositories as they are found or reportedFigure 1 DEV-0569 activity seen in September 2022 where the landing site hosted BATLOADER posing as a TeamViewer installerAside from using installer files Microsoft has also observed the use of file formats like Virtual Hard Disk VHD impersonating legitimate software for first-stage payloads These VHDs also contain malicious scripts that lead to the download of DEV-0569s malware payloadsDEV-0569 has used varied infection chains using PowerShell and batch scripts that ultimately led to the download of malware payloads like information stealers or a legitimate remote management tool used for persistence on the network The management tool can also be an access point for the staging and spread of ransomwareDEV-0569 also continues to tamper with antivirus products In September and October 2022 Microsoft saw activity where DEV-0569 used the open-source NSudo tool to attempt disabling antivirus solutions Figure 2 High-level view of observed DEV-0569 infection chains between August to October 2022In this campaign DEV-0569 sent a message to targets using the contact form on these targets websites posing as a national financial authority When a contacted target responds via email DEV-0569 replied with a message that contained a link to BATLOADER Microsoft Defender for Office 365 detects the spoofing behavior as well as the malicious links in these emailsThe malicious links in the contact forms led to BATLOADER malware hosted on abused web services like GitHub and OneDrive The installers launched a PowerShell script that issued multiple commands including downloading a NirCmd command-line utility provided by freeware developer NirSoftIf successful the command allows the attacker to elevate from local admin to SYSTEM rights similar to executing a scheduled task as SYSTEMMicrosoft identified instances involving DEV-0569 infection chains that ultimately facilitated human-operated ransomware attacks distributing Royal ransomware Based on tactics observed by Microsoft ransomware attackers likely gained access to compromised networks via a BATLOADER-delivered Cobalt Strike Beacon implantIn late October 2022 Microsoft researchers identified a DEV-0569 malvertising campaign leveraging Google Ads that point to the legitimate traffic distribution system TDS Keitaro which provides capabilities to customize advertising campaigns via tracking ad traffic and user- or device-based filtering Microsoft observed that the TDS redirects the user to a legitimate download site or under certain conditions to the malicious BATLOADER download site Microsoft reported this abuse to Google for awareness and consideration for actionUsing Keitaro DEV-0569 can use traffic filtering provided by Keitaro to deliver their payloads to specified IP ranges and targets This traffic filtering can also aid DEV-0569 in avoiding IP ranges of known security sandboxing solutionsDefenders can also apply the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threatMicrosoft Defender Antivirus detects threat components as the following malwareNSudo activity is detected by the tamper protection capability asAlerts with the following titles in the security center can indicate threat activity on your networkWhile the following alerts might indicate activity associated with this threat they could also be triggered by unrelated threat activityMicrosoft has been tracking activity related to the financially motivated threat actor Octo Tempest whose evolving campaigns represent a growing concern for many organizations across multiple industriesUser containment is a unique and innovative defense mechanism that stops human-operated attacks in their tracks Weve added user containment to the automatic attack disruption capability in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint User containment is automatically triggered by high-fidelity signals and limits attackers ability to move laterally within a network regardless of the compromised accounts Active Directory state or privilege levelThe threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-0324 is a financially motivated group known to gain initial access using email-based initial infection vectors and then hand off access to compromised networks to other threat actors These handoffs frequently lead to ransomware deployment Beginning in July 2023 Storm-0324 was observed distributing payloads using an open-source tool Microsoft Defender is our toolset for prevention and mitigation of data exfiltration and ransomware attacks Microsoft Purview data security offers important mitigations as well and

Another Punycode domain of theirs sends would-be victims to clirtschwbcom which combines a brand misspelling with PunycodeWe see the same dynamic with the Disneyland Team Punycode domain httpssinglepointxn--bamk-pxb5435bcom which translates to singlepointbamkcom again phishing US Bank customersWhats going on here Holden says the Disneyland Team is Russian-speaking if not also based in Russia but it is not a phishing gang per se Rather this group uses the phony bank domains in conjunction with malicious software that is already secretly installed on a victims computerIn years past crooks like these would use custom-made web injects to manipulate what Gozi victims see in their Web browser when they visit their banks site These web injects allowed malware to rewrite the banks HTML code on the fly and copy andor intercept any data users would enter into a web-based form such as a username and passwordMost Web browser makers however have spent years adding security protections to block such nefarious activity As a result the Disneyland Team simply tries to make their domains look as much like the real thing as possible and then funnel victims toward interacting with those imposter sitesThe reason that it is infeasible for them to use in-browser injects include browser and OS protection measures and difficulties manipulating dynamic pages for banks that require multi-factor authentication Holden saidIn reality the fake bank website overlaid by the Disneyland Teams malware relays the victims browser activity through to the real bank website while allowing the attackers to forward any secondary login requests from the bank such as secret questions or multi-factor authentication challengesThe Disneyland Team included instructions for its users noting that when the victim enters their login credentials he sees a 10-second spinning wheel and then the message Awaiting back office approval for your request Please dont close this windowA fake PNC website overlay or web inject displaying a message intended to temporarily prevent the user from accessing their accountThe SKIP button in the screenshot above sends the user to the real bank login page in case the account is not interesting to us the manual explains Also this redirect works if none of our operators are working at the timeThe TAKE button in the Disneyland Team control panel allows users or affiliates to claim ownership over a specific infected machine or bot which then excludes other users from interacting with that victimIn the event that it somehow takes a long time to get the victim bot connected to the Disneyland Team control panel or if it is necessary to delay a transaction users can push a button that prompts the following message to appear on the victims screenYour case ID number is 875472 An online banking support representative will get in touch shortly Please provide your case ID number and DO NOT close this pageThe Disneyland user manual explains that the panel can be used to force the victim to log in again if they transmit invalid credentials It also has other options for stalling victims whilst their accounts are drained Another fake prompt the panel can produce shows the victim a message saying We are currently working on updating our security system You should be able to log in once the countdown timer expiresThe user manual says this option blocks the user from accessing their account for two hours It is possible to block for an hour with this button in this case they get less frustrated within the hours ddos will kill their networkThose stories also observed that since the vast majority of the malicious software used in cyberheists is designed to run only on Microsoft Windows computers it made sense to pick a non-Windows computer for that dedicated banking system such as a Mac or even a version of Linux I still stand by this advice This entry was posted on Wednesday 16th of November 2022 1232 PM The SKIP button in the screenshot above sends the user to the real bank login pageI see no SKIP button in that screenshotHe was referring to the first screenshot it shows the panel the phishers are usingFirst screenshot Not the one immediately abovelook closer So you admit that you are blindThe security importance of a clean screen becomes apparentIts not a matter of having a dirty screen its the fact that immediately above that sentence is a screenshot which does not include the skip button This was actually bad form on the part of the editor who laid out this page to leave the sentence worded that way after placing the sentence below an unrelated screenshot Had the second screenshot appeared just after that sentence there would be no confusionI was confused by the same incongruity until I scrolled back up the page to see whether it was referring to a different image above than the one immediately aboveOne thing that can be important is to set up an entirely different and secret e-mail address to be used for banking Whenever you get e-mail from the bank if it is not to that e-mail address then you should be very skeptical of the e-mailWow Thanks for the heads up While I use a variety of data points to help see a malicious site misspellings and lack of personalization have been easy to spot this illustrates how much more difficult it is becoming even for the cautiously aware users Will using the latest browser updates from Google Chrome Microsoft Edge Chromium or an Outlook safe link clicked from an updated version of MS Office 365 prevent or flag an oversightIn Firefox you can set it to show the full punycode rather than have it translated to the spoofed non-Latin lettersaboutconfig networkIDNshowpunycode TRUEHowever it seems the use of punycode here is used in conjunction with man-in-the-browser malware already on the victim machine which redirects the victims browser I would think the malware would also just switch the config tooSo in this scenario the computer is pwned already The best advice is what Brian said have dedicated hardware for online banking that you always use for banking and never use for anything elseWhen was this activity initially discovered IS it possible it was discovered before Gozi operators purportedly moved on from targeting the banking sector Are the old and new operations operating concurrentlyStrip punycode disguises in Firefox

it you also have 2 factor authentication for your bankingNo two-factor except when I can use my landline for it Too much SIM-swapping going onLook carefully and youll notice small dots beneath the a

characters LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME even when hovering over them but the URLs it then actually navigates to are differentHow to fix this Mail clients could show the translated xn-- url but that of course only works for tech savvy people and as long as most hostnames are ascii based because otherwise it will be complete gibberish to humansIs there a reason you arent recommending people using their banks app in place of a browserMy advice skews toward businesses which enjoy exactly zero legal protection against fraud like this If youre a consumer and your account gets cleaned out because of a trojan youre not on the hook for that loss Businesses areAlso I have a hard time seeing an accountant for a business doing all they need to do with their bank from a mobile phone vs a computer but thats just meAgree Brian on the business preference for using a desktoplaptop for large scale ops over a small mobile deviceI knew that at the birth of the iPhone Run a payroll on a 2 x 3 screen RightHowever the enormous exponential current Zelle losses caused by gullible consumers using weak security SMS comms actively sponsored by bankscredit unions despite the Jy 2016 NIST warning numerous FBI warnings since and the stunner NSA 29Jy21 says the depth of stupidity and greed in the financial world is thicker than I had perceivedSo much good luck to these Zelle banks on their conflict with defrauded MITM consumers with their Regulation E claimsBased on the last 25 years of documented rampant compromise electronic commerce is not to be trustedAlways have a non-electronic Plan BI guess it is a fraud world after all Do your banking from a dedicated security-hardened systemmeaning a Chromebook Never use a Windows computer for on-line banking Best would be to use a Chromebook for reading email and browsing tooI am not sure if you are joking or not A friend was cleaning out an abandoned house and came across a Chrome book wondering if they could use it they asked me for helpIn less than an hour without myself even seeing it we had taken it over user data and all Granted there was physical contact but it did not seem very secure in the leastGenerally speaking if an adversary has physical access to your device its no longer your deviceThanks Brian for your reminder of a not-new problem being dusted off by perps and inflicted on us againI added a firewall rule to put the kibbosh on all xn-- addressesxn--I realize this is draconian and would create an unworkable situation for users who legitimately need to access such domains but I do not manage any users who have these needs so for now Im going with it In addition to that I prettied up and added Brians list to my pi-hole to specifically block that handful of domainsI verified that Vivaldi 55 on Android catches

        "text": "Solutions forThreatsCategories15 Nov 2022 minute readTable of ContentsAuthorsDTrack allows criminals to upload download start or delete files on the victim host Among those downloaded and executed files already spotted in the standard DTrack toolset there is a keylogger a screenshot maker and a module for gathering victim system information With a toolset like this criminals can implement lateral movement into the victims infrastructure in order to for example retrieve compromising informationDTrack itself hasnt changed much over the course of time Nevertheless there are some interesting modifications that we want to highlight in this blogpost Dtrack hides itself inside an executable that looks like a legitimate program and there are several stages of decryption before the malware payload startsDTrack unpacks the malware in several stages The second stage is stored inside the malware PE file To get it there are two approachesThe idea is that DTrack retrieves the payload by reading it from an offset within the file or by reading it from a resource within the PE binary An example of a decompiled pseudo function that retrieves the data using the offset-based approach can be found belowExample of DTrack offset-oriented retrieval functionAfter retrieving the location of the next stage and its key the malware then decrypts the buffer with a modified RC4 algorithm and passes control to it To figure out the offset of the payload its size and decryption keys DTrack has a special binary we have dubbed it Decrypt config structure hidden in an inconspicuous part of the PE fileThe second stage payload consists of heavily obfuscated shellcode as can be seen belowHeavily obfuscated second stage shellcodeThe encryption method used by the second layer differs for each sample So far we have spotted modified versions of RC4 RC5 and RC6 algorithms The values of the third stage payload and its decryption key are obtained by reading Decrypt config againOne new aspect of the recent DTrack variants is that the third stage payload is not necessarily the final payload there may be another piece of binary data consisting of a binary configuration and at least one shellcode which in turn decrypts and executes the final payloadThe shellcode has some quite interesting obfuscation tricks to make analysis more difficult When started the beginning of the key used to decrypt the final payload is searched for For example when the beginning of the key is 0xDEADBEEF the shellcode searches for the first occurrence of 0xDEADBEEFChunk decryption routine exampleOnce the key is found the shellcode uses it to decrypt the next eight bytes after the key which form yet another configuration block with final payload size and its entry point offset The configuration block is followed by an encrypted PE payload that starts at the entry point offset after decryption with the custom algorithmOnce the final payload a DLL is decrypted it is loaded using process hollowing into explorerexe In previous DTrack samples the libraries to be loaded were obfuscated strings In more recent versions they use API hashing to load the proper libraries and functions Another small change is that three C2 servers are used instead of six The rest of the payloads functionality remains the sameWhen we look at the domain names used for C2 servers a pattern can be seen in some cases For example the actors combine a color with the name of an animal eg pinkgoat purplebear salmonrabbit Some of the peculiar names used in the DTrack infrastructure can be found belowAccording to KSN telemetry we have detected DTrack activity in Germany Brazil India Italy Mexico Switzerland Saudi Arabia Turkey and the United States indicating that DTrack is spreading into more parts of the world The targeted sectors are education chemical manufacturing governmental research centers and policy institutes IT service providers utility providers and telecommunicationsThe DTrack backdoor continues to be used actively by the Lazarus group Modifications in the way the malware is packed show that Lazarus still sees DTrack as an important asset Despite this Lazarus has not changed the backdoor much

        "text": "Vyacheslav Tank Penchukov the accused 40-year-old Ukrainian leader of a prolific cybercriminal group that stole tens of millions of dollars from small to mid-sized businesses in the United States and Europe has been arrested in Switzerland according to multiple sourcesWanted Ukrainian cybercrime suspect Vyacheslav Tank Penchukov right was arrested in Geneva Switzerland Tank was the day-to-day manager of a cybercriminal group that stole tens of millions of dollars from small to mid-sized businessesPenchukov was named in a 2014 indictment by the US Department of Justice as a top figure in the JabberZeus Crew a small but potent cybercriminal collective from Ukraine and Russia that attacked victim companies with a powerful custom-made version of the Zeus banking trojanThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI declined to comment for this story But according to multiple sources Penchukov was arrested in Geneva Switzerland roughly three weeks ago as he was traveling to meet up with his wife thereTank aka DJ Slava Rich seen here performing as a DJ in Ukraine in an undated photo from social mediaInvestigators knew Bogachev and JabberZeus were linked because for many years they were reading the private Jabber chats between and among members of the JabberZeus crew and Bogachevs monitored aliases were in semi-regular contact with the group about updates to the malwareGary Warner director of research in computer forensics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham noted in his blog from 2014 that Tank told co-conspirators in a JabberZeus chat on July 22 2009 that his daughter Miloslava had been born and gave her birth weightA search of Ukrainian birth records only showed one girl named Miloslava with that birth weight born on that day Warner wrote This was enough to positively identify Tank as Penchukov Warner saidIn early October the Ukrainian surveillance team said theyd lost him he wrote The Americans were unhappy and a little surprised But they were also resigned to what they saw as the realities of working in Ukraine The country had a notorious corruption problem The running joke was that it was easy to find the SBUs anticorruption unitjust look for the parking lot full of BMWsI first encountered Tank and the JabberZeus crew roughly 14 years ago as a reporter for The Washington Post after a trusted source confided that hed secretly gained access to the groups private Jabber conversationsFrom reading those discussions each day it became clear Tank was nominally in charge of the Ukrainian crew and that he spent much of his time overseeing the activities of the money mule recruiters which were an integral part of their victim cashout schemeIt was soon discovered that the phony corporate websites the money mule recruiters used to manage new hires had a security weakness that allowed anyone who signed up at the portal to view messages for every other user A scraping tool was built to harvest these money mule recruitment messages and at the height of the JabberZeus gangs activity in 2010 that scraper was monitoring messages on close to a dozen different money mule recruitment sites each managing hundreds of employeesWhen it came time to transfer stolen funds the recruiters would send a message through the fake company website saying something like Good morning mule name here Our client XYZ Corp is sending you some money today Please visit your bank now and withdraw this payment in cash and then wire the funds in equal payments minus your commission to these three individuals in Eastern EuropeOnly in every case the company mentioned as the client was in fact a small business whose payroll accounts theyd already hacked intoSo each day for several years my morning routine went as follows Make a pot of coffee shuffle over to the computer and view the messages Tank and his co-conspirators had sent to their money mules over the previous 12-24 hours look up the victim company names in Google pick up the phone to warn each that they were in the process of being robbed by the Russian Cyber MobMy spiel on all of these calls was more or less the same You probably have no idea who I am but heres all my contact info and what I do Your payroll accounts have been hacked and youre about to lose a great deal of money You should contact your bank immediately and have them put a hold on any pending transfers before its too late Feel free to call me back afterwards if you want more information about how I know all this but for now please just call or visit your bankIn many instances my call would come in just minutes or hours before an unauthorized payroll batch was processed by the victim companys bank and some of those notifications prevented what otherwise would have been enormous losses often several times the amount of the organizations normal weekly payroll At some point I stopped counting how many tens of thousands of dollars those calls saved victims but over several years it was probably in the millionsJust as often the victim company would suspect that I was somehow involved in the robbery and soon after alerting them I would receive a call from an FBI agent or from a police officer in the victims hometown Those were always interesting conversationstank Are you theretank This is what they damn wrote about metank

that our favorite Brian didnt get his contract extension at Washington Post We are giddily awaiting confirmationGood news expected exactly by the New Year Besides us no one reads his columntankMr Fucking Brian Fucking KerbsAnother member of the JabberZeus crew Ukrainian-born Maksim Aqua Yakubets also is currently wanted by the FBI which is offering a 5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and convictionAlleged Evil Corp bigwig Maksim Aqua Yakubets Image FBIDuring the hearing on 24 October 2022 the person did not consent to his extradition to the USA via a simplified proceeding the FOJ continued After completion of the formal extradition procedure the FOJ has decided to grant his extradition to the USA on 15 November 2022 The decision of the FOJ may be appealed at the Swiss Criminal Federal Court respectively at the Swiss Supreme Court This entry was posted on Tuesday 15th of November 2022 1038 AM Great story Brian Any idea how the news about the Post eliminating your job leakedMust admit the leak of Brians job termination is most intriguing Also was surprised at how bad the OPSEC of the hacker was in that he gave out precise personal data have to wonder if it was because he thought he had enduring impunityI have to admit Ukrainian Government has shown a real talent propaganda narratives lately but this is something different During the Blitz Winston Churchill stood on the floor of the House of Commons and noted that Blitz was a losing strategy with diminishing returns Eventually the bombs would as he put it just make the rubble jump Thats a heck of a thing to tell somebody sleeping in the underground every night but there it isI think its time somebody told Computer Security folk yelling Arms Race that the rubble is jumpingRe Ukrainian government note that the corruption was before Euromaidan when the very corrupt government was thrown out and the president had to fleeto Russia Doesnt mean all current Ukrainian citizens are angels butNot sure Im understanding your point about yelling Arms Race Churchhills point was that Nazi bombers had already done everything they could Iassume youre not trying to claim Computer Security people have already done everything they can possibly do to prevent attacks If you are reading though a blog called KrebsOnSecurity might disabuse you of the notion I see your point and yes I have since before it was born actually when Brian worked at the WAPO My views on Computer Security practice are informed by a web classic Enumerating Goodness The gist is that once somebody screams Arms Race the data collection game changes to protect the legacy revenue stream When I early voted recently I had a one guy with three valid drivers licenses ahead of me He was moving building a house etc The system was baffled but quickly fixed by the poll workers they had him walk through the door with one license then back through the door with the next then the third although the second turned out to be the charm Fortunately there were only two people and four identities in line but it gives you an appreciation for the difference security and a career in Computer SecurityKrebs should do a article on all the money mule scams going on with FacebookcomConsidering the Post had a spy working for them probably around that time hardly surprisingIt is quite revealing that they couldnt actually charge him with the actual crime Conspiracy to sounds like they have nothing They list bank fraud and identity theft too But shouldnt there be something about breaking into millions of other peoples computers or creating the required toolkit with malicious intent at leastAre they trying to get him for one of the biggest malware campaigns in history or just some three card monte in a backyardYou didnt read did you The indictments are for the actual crime conspiracy to is in ADDITION TO the other chargesWhen the DOJ indicts they usually add conspiracy charges on top of the actual crime The conspiracy charge allows them to add other co-conspirators and add to the sentence because they willfully collaborated to continue the crimeAll of the defendants are charged with conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity conspiracy to commit computer fraud and identity theft aggravated identity theft and multiple counts of bank fraudMaybe its confusing with all the commas The identity theft and bank fraud are serious charges by themselves Those are also the actual crimes Creating the the toolkit with malicious intent would be called conspiracy to commit computer fraud in the proper legal termsMaybe you think conspiracy isnt a real crime or that it means something more like attempted but didnt commitBut the law is different than you think Conspiracy means the crime was committed but with othersThe description with the pot of coffee and the phone calls made me chuckle Brian must have been saving that little nugget for years until the day their ringleader was apprehendedI am astounded that someone who made a living by breaking through security measures would have such disregard for his own operational security Even after he knew something was wrong it didnt occur to him to try to find the problem and fix itI cannot imagine the level of smug that you must have felt after your morning calls were completed the first day every single one instantly blocked the payments Brian Thats a hell of a wake-up routineI would also love to if you have time hear your write-up of a few example responses from local PDsFBI offices trying to work out whats going

        "text": "Hackers are conducting a massive black hat search engine optimization SEO campaign by compromising almost 15000 websites to redirect visitors to fake QA discussion forumsThe attacks were first spotted by Sucuri who says that each compromised site contains approximately 20000 files used as part of the search engine spam campaign with most of the sites being WordPressThe researchers believe the threat actors' goal is to generate enough indexed pages to increase the fake QA sites' authority and thus rank better in search enginesThe campaign likely primes these sites for future use as malware droppers or phishing sites as even a short-term operation on the first page of Google Search would result in many infectionsAn alternative scenario based on the existence of an 'adstxt' file on the landing sites is that their owners want to drive more traffic to conduct ad fraudIn some cases the attackers drop their own PHP files on the targeted site using random or pseudo-legitimate file names like 'wp-loglnphp'The infected or injected files contain malicious code that checks if the website visitors are logged in to WordPress and if they're not redirects them to the httpsoisisimageslogo-6png URLHowever browsers will not be sent an image from this URL but will instead have JavaScript loaded that redirects users to a Google search click URL that redirects users to the promoted QA siteUsing a Google search click URL is likely to increase performance metrics on the URLs in the Google Index to make it appear as if the sites are popular hoping to increase their ranking in the search resultsFurthermore redirecting through Google search click URLs makes the traffic look more legitimate possibly bypassing some security softwareThe exclusion of logged-in users as well as those standing at 'wp-loginphp' aims to avoid redirecting an administrator of the site which would result in the raising of suspicion and the cleaning of the compromised siteThe PNG image file uses the 'windowlocationhref' function to generate the Google Search redirection result to one of the following targeted domainsMost of these websites hide their servers behind Cloudflare so Sucuri's analysts couldn't learn more about the campaign's operatorsAs all of the sites use similar website-building templates and all appear to have been generated by automated tools it is likely they allbelong to the same threat actorsSucuri couldn't identify how the threat actors breached the websites used for redirections However it likely happens by exploiting a vulnerable plugin or brute-forcing the WordPress admin passwordHence the recommendation is to upgrade all WordPress plugins and website CMS to the latest version and activate two-factor authentication 2FA on admin accounts"

        "text": "The Department of Homeland Security launched a failed operation that ensnared hundreds if not thousands of US protesters in what new documents show was as a sweeping power-hungry effort before the 2020 election to bolster President Donald Trumps spurious claims about a terrorist organization he accused his Democratic rivals of supportingThe report describes attempts by top officials to link protesters to an imaginary terrorist plot in an apparent effort to boost Trumps reelection odds raising concerns now about the ability of a sitting president to co-opt billions of dollars worth of domestic intelligence assets for their own political gain DHS analysts recounted orders to generate evidence of financial ties between protesters in custody an effort that had they not failed would have seemingly served to legitimize President Trumps false claims about Antifa an organization that even his most loyal intelligence officers failed to drum up proof ever existed The DHS report offers a full accounting of the intelligence activities happening behind the scenes of officers protest containment twisted efforts Wyden said of Trump administration officials promoting baseless conspiracy theories to manufacture of a domestic terrorist threat for the presidents political gain The report describes the dossiers generated by DHS as having detailed the past whereabouts and the friends and followers of the subjects as well as their interests up to and including First Amendment speech activity Intelligence analysts had internally raised concerns about the decision to accuse anyone caught in the streets by default of being an anarchist extremist specifically because sufficient facts were never found to support such a characterizationOne field operations analyst told interviewers that the charts were hastily thrown together adding they didnt even know why some of the people were arrested In some cases it was unclear whether the arrests were made by police or by one of the several federal agencies on the ground The analysts were never provided arrest affidavits or paperwork a witness told investigators adding that they just worked off the assumption that everyone on the list was arrested Lawyers who reviewed 43 of the dossiers found it concerning the report says that 13 of them stemmed from nonviolent crimes These included trespassing though it was unclear to analysts and investigators whether the cases had any relationship to federal property the report saysA footnote in the report states that at least one witness told investigators that dossiers had been requested on people who were not arrested but merely accused of threats Another citing emails exchanged between top intelligence officials states dossiers were created on persons arrested having nothing to do with homeland security or threats to officersQuestioned by investigators the agencys chief intelligence officer acknowledged fielding requests by Wolf and his acting deputy Ken Cuccinelli to create dossiers against everyone participating in the Portland protest regardless of whether theyd been accused of any crime the report says That officer Brian Murphy then head of the agencys Office of Intelligence and Analysis IA told interviewers that hed rejected the idea informing his bosses that he could only look at people who were arrested and adding that it was something his office had done thousands of times beforeThe DHS report finalized more than a year ago includes descriptions of orders handed down to senior leadership instructing them to broadly apply the label violent antifa anarchists inspired to Portland protesters unless they had intel showing something differentOnce the dossiers were received by the agencys emerging threat center it became clear that DHS had no real way to tie the protesters to any terrorist activities neither at home nor abroad Efforts to drum up evidence to support the administrations claim that a larger network was directing or financing the protesters a task assigned to another unit known as the Homeland Identities Targeting and Exploitation Center diverted away from its usual work of analyzing national security threats did not find any evidence that assertion was true the report saysFears of political toadies occupying key intelligence roles had been aired publicly by former intelligence community members during the Trump administrations early years but their concerns were all but ignored by Senate Republicans during confirmation hearings that would ultimately inflict serious reputational damage on a number of agencies that for their own survival had long avoided partisan leanings The report is based on interviews with approximately 80 employees conducted by attorneys drawn from various agency components including US Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard The investigation began in response to leaks of internal DHS emails in July 2020 that prompted questions from lawmakers about potential intelligence abuses including the monitoring of journalists activities online and the liberal application of terrorism-related language to describe Americans engaged in protestIA is one of the nations 17 intelligence community members overseen by the nations top spy the director of national intelligence whose office drafts daily top-secret briefings for the president The directorship was held throughout the protests by John Ratcliffe a Republican of Texas and renowned Trump loyalist whose nomination to the post was withdrawn initially in 2019 over qualifications concerns raised by lawmakers and career intelligence officialsThe dossiers known as Operational Background Reports or OBRs are known colloquially within the agency as baseball cards the report says The task of creating them was handed with little to no guidance on execution to the agencys Current and Emerging Threats Center an analysis unit whose actionable intelligence is distributed widely throughout the government According to the report the dossiers wouldve been shared with among others the agencys Field Operations Division which works closely with House and Senate committee staffers and the Federal Protection Service whose core mission is securing some 9000 federal facilities across the country The extent to which entities outside the federal government were meant to be involved is unclear however the report indicates that DHS state and local partners which would naturally include law enforcement but also potentially organizations like National Governors Association could have also been in the loopFloyds death at the hands of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin convicted of murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison in 2021 sparked more than 100 days of continuous marches in Portland Sporadic protests continued well into the next spring frequently marked by nightly standoffs between protesters toting bottles fruit and fireworks and riot-control squads armed with nightsticks pepperspray and kinetic impact munitions designed to irritate disorient and compel compliance through pain Police would eventually rack up an unprecedented 6000 documented use-of-force cases against the demonstrators who in turn reportedly inflicted more than 23 million in damage to federal buildings alone Police ran off legal observers and physically beat journalist who suffered injuries at the hands of federal agents armed with crowd control weapons as well In response to the bad press Justice Department lawyers filed a successful motion in court giving police the power to force reporters off the streets One tweet published on July 26 a week after Lawfare published the guidance document included a leaked email by DHSs acting chief intelligence officer relaying orders to begin referring to all violence in Portland as the work of Antifa As the summer nights grew longer and the 2020 elections near the media spent less time focused on the cause of the demonstrations the suffocation of a Black father of five by a white Minneapolis police officer who was outwardly unmoved by Floyds desperate pleas for air or the heartrending cries for his mother Headlines shifted instead as if on cue to focus on the narrative crafted by the presidents flailing reelection campaign a pre-packed delusion designed to strike fear in voters imaginations and tether Democrats to a fictitious terrorist threatShocking and alarming career intelligence officials Graham posted a letter online ahead of the elections final debate It contained a batch of Russian disinformation that a Republican-led committee had disregarded as bogus four years earlier Apparently it focused on the only Democratic left on whom they could find any material with which to smear Hillary Clinton who had no election to lose"

        "text": "Mondelez International maker of Oreos and Ritz Crackers has settled a lawsuit against its cyber insurer after the provider refused to cover a multimillion-dollar clean-up bill stemming from the sprawling NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017The lawsuit hinged on the contract terms in the cyber insurance policy specifically an exclusion carve-out for damages caused by acts of warIn the case of Mondelez the malware locked up 1700 of its servers and a staggering 24000 laptops leaving the corporation incapacitated and reeling from more than 100 million in damages downtime lost profits and remediation costsAs if that weren't tough enough to swallow the food kahuna soon found itself choking on the response from Zurich American when it filed a cyber insurance claim The underwriter had no intention of covering the costs citing the aforementioned exclusion clause that included the language hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war by a government or sovereign powerThanks to world governments' attribution of NotPetya to the Russian state and the original mission of the attack to strike a known kinetic adversary of Moscow Zurich American had a case despite the fact that the Mondelez attack was certainly unintended collateral damageHowever Mondelez argued that Zurich American's contract left some disputed crumbs on the table as it were given the lack of clarity in what could and could not be covered in an attack Specifically the insurance policy clearly stated that it would cover all risks of physical loss or damage emphasis on all to electronic data programs or software including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction It's a situation that NotPetya perfectly embodiesCaroline Thompson head of underwriting at Cowbell Cyber a cyber insurance provider for small and midsize businesses SMBs notes that the lack of clear cyber insurance policy-wording left the door open for Mondelez's appeal and should act as a cautionary message to others negotiating coverageThe scope of coverage and the application of war exclusions remains one of the most challenging areas for insurers as cyber threats continue to evolve businesses increase their dependencies on digital operations and geopolitical tensions continue to have widespread impact she tells Dark Reading It is paramount for insurers to be familiar with the terms of their policy and seek clarification where needed but also opt for modern cyber-policies that can evolve and adapt at the pace their risk and exposures doThere's one glaring issue in making war exclusions stick for cyber insurance the difficulty in proving that attacks are indeed acts of war a burden that generally requires determining on whose behalf they're carried outIn the best of cases attribution is more of an art than a science with a shifting set of criteria underpinning any confident finger-pointing Rationales for advanced persistent threat APT attribution often rely on far more than quantifiable technology artifacts or overlaps in infrastructure and tooling with known threatsWhat is shocking to me is the idea of verifying that these attacks can be reasonably attributed to a state how says Philippe Humeau CEO and co-founder of CrowdSec It is well known that you can hardly track a decently skilled cybercriminal's base of operations since air-gapping their operations is the first line of their playbook Two governments are not willing to actually admit they do provide cover for the cybercriminals in their countries Three cybercriminals in many parts of the world are usually some mix of corsairs and mercenaries faithful to whatever entitynation-state may be funding them but totally expandable and deniable if there are ever questions about their affiliationThat's why absent a government taking responsibility for an attack a la terrorism groups most threat-intelligence firms will caveat state-sponsored attribution with phrases like we determine with lowmoderatehigh confidence that XYZ is behind the attack and to boot different firms may determine different sources for any given attack If it's that difficult for professional cyber-threat-hunters to pin down the culprits imagine how difficult it is for cyber-insurance adjusters operating with a fraction of the skillsIf the standard for proof of an act of war is wide governmental consensus this also poses issues Humeau saysAccurately attributing attacks to nation-states would require cross-country legal cooperation which has historically proven to be both difficult and slow says Humeau So the idea of attributing these attacks to nation-states who will never 'fess up to it leaves too much room for doubt legally speakingTo Thompson's point one of the realities in today's environment is the sheer volume of state-sponsored cyber activity in circulation Bryan Cunningham attorney and advisory council member at data security company Theon Technology notes that if more and more insurers simply deny all claims stemming from such activity there could be very few payouts indeed And ultimately companies may not see cyber-insurance premiums as worth it anymoreIf a significant number of judges actually begin allowing carriers to exclude coverage for cyberattacks just upon a claim that a nation-state was involved this will be as devastating to the cyber insurance ecosystem as 911 was temporarily to commercial real estate he says As a result I do not think many judges will buy this and proof in any event will almost always be difficultIn a different vein Ilia Kolochenko chief architect and CEO of ImmuniWeb notes that the cybercriminals will find a way to use the exclusions to their advantage undercutting the value of having a policy even furtherThe problem stems from a possible impersonation of well-known cyber-threat actors he says For instance if cybercriminals unrelated to any state wish to amplify the damage caused to their victims by excluding the eventual insurance coverage they may simply try to impersonate a famous state-backed hacking group during their intrusion This will undermine trust in the cyber-insurance market as any insurance may become futile in the most serious cases that actually require the coverage and justify the premiums paidEven though the Mondelez-Zurich American settlement would seem to indicate that the insurer succeeded in at least partially making its point or perhaps neither side had the stomach for incurring further legal costs there is conflicting legal precedentEven so success for such policies remains to be seenLloyd's and other carriers are working on making such exclusions stronger and absolute but I think this too ultimately will fail because the cyber-insurance industry likely could not survive such changes for long Theon's Cunningham saysCopyright 2023 Informa PLC Informa UK Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company number 1072954

        "text": "A 26-year-old Ukrainian man is awaiting extradition from The Netherlands to the United States on charges that he acted as a core developer for Raccoon a popular malware-as-a-service offering that helped paying customers steal passwords and financial data from millions of cybercrime victims KrebsOnSecurity has learned that the defendant was busted in March 2022 after fleeing mandatory military service in Ukraine in the weeks following the Russian invasionUkrainian national Mark Sokolovsky seen here in a Porsche Cayenne on Mar 18 fleeing mandatory military service in Ukraine This image was taken by Polish border authorities as Sokolovskys vehicle entered Germany Image KrebsOnSecuritycomThe US Attorney for the Western District of Texas unsealed an indictment last week that named Ukrainian national Mark Sokolovsky as the core developer for the Raccoon Infostealer business which was marketed on several Russian-language cybercrime forums beginning in 2019Raccoon was essentially a Web-based control panel where for 200 a month customers could get the latest version of the Raccoon Infostealer malware and interact with infected systems in real time Security experts say the passwords and other data stolen by Raccoon malware were often resold to groups engaged in deploying ransomwareWorking with investigators in Italy and The Netherlands US authorities seized a copy of the server used by Raccoon to help customers manage their botnets According to the US Justice Department FBI agents have identified more than 50 million unique credentials and forms of identification email addresses bank accounts cryptocurrency addresses credit card numbers etc stolen with the help of RaccoonThe Raccoon v 1 web panel where customers could search by infected IP and stolen cookies wallets domains and passwordsAccording to those sources US authorities zeroed in on an operational security mistake that the Raccoon developer made early on in his posts to the crime forums connecting a Gmail account for a cybercrime forum identity used by the Raccoon developer Photix to an Apple iCloud account belonging to Sokolovsky For example the indictment includes a photo that investigators subpoenaed from Sokolovskys iCloud account that shows him posing with several stacks of bundled cashA selfie pulled from Mark Sokolovskys iCloud account Image USDOJWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in late February 2022 Sokolovsky was living in Kharkiv a city in northeast Ukraine that would soon come under heavy artillery bombardment from Russian forces Authorities monitoring Sokolovskys iCloud account had spent weeks watching him shuttle between Kharkiv and the Ukrainian capital Kyiv but on Mar 18 2022 his phone suddenly showed up in PolandInvestigators learned from Polish border guards that Sokolovsky had fled Ukraine in a Porsche Cayenne along with a young blond woman leaving his mother and other family behind The image at the top of this post was shared with US investigators by Polish border security officials and it shows Sokolovsky leaving Poland for Germany on Mar 18At the time all able-bodied men of military age were required to report for service to help repel the Russian invasion and it would have been illegal for Sokolovsky to leave Ukraine without permission But both sources said investigators believe Sokolovsky bribed border guards to let them passAuthorities soon tracked Sokolovskys phone through Germany and eventually to The Netherlands with his female companion helpfully documenting every step of the trip on her Instagram account Here is a picture she posted of the two embracing upon their arrival in Amsterdams Dam SquareAuthorities in The Netherlands arrested Sokolovsky on Mar 20 and quickly seized control over the Raccoon Infostealer infrastructure Meanwhile on March 25 the accounts that had previously advertised the Raccoon Stealer malware on cybercrime forums announced the service was closing down The parting message to customers said nothing of an arrest and instead insinuated that the core members in charge of the malware-as-a-service project had perished in the Russian invasionUnfortunately due to the special operation we will have to close our Raccoon Stealer project the team announced Mar 25 Our team members who were responsible for critical components of the product are no longer with us Thank you for this experience and time for every day unfortunately everything sooner or later the end of the WORLD comes to everyoneSokolovskys extradition to the United States has been granted but he is appealing that decision He faces one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of aggravated identity theftIf convicted Sokolovsky faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud and money laundering offenses five years for the conspiracy to commit computer fraud charge and a mandatory consecutive two-year term for the aggravated identity theft offense This entry was posted on Monday 31st of October 2022 0453 PM I have no sympathy for this self-centered sociopathic crook and coward Once US justice is done with him he should go back to stand for cybercrime draft evasion and bribery plus whatever else applies And it will be appropriate and hood for him to spend a stretch in prison at home Slava Ukraini And Most people living near Kharkov and other south eatern Ukraine are ethnically Russians and they could not care less about Ukraine thats why most of them will not want to be drafted and will flee to Europe Nationalism is something new in Ukraine and most people dont feel it No due to the war this nationalist sentiment in pushed through media but when the war is over we will see how the people of Ukraine are thinking about this conflict Nationalism is something new in UkraineWell its a pretty new nation after all hope it lastsNationalism is something new in UkrainePlease tell that to fans of the national poet of Ukraine Taras Shevchenko 1814 1861 Please tell that to the Zaporizhian Cossacks who unite much of Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries and the Cossack Hetmanate of the 18th century Tell that to those who briefly set up man Independent Ukraine in 1918 Tell that to those who suffered under the Holodomor of the 1930s And so onUkrainian nationalism is only news to PutinYou have no clue The Ukrainians in Kharkiv with -iv and elsewhere are crystal clear about the death and destruction that the Russian terror brought into their lives Even before these bastards occupied Crimea in 2014 No need to wait for the Russian defeat to see that theres been a dramatic shift in perception Russia is nothing but a terrorist state that destroyed thousands of lives One doesnt have to join the military to fight against them and their barbaric threatsWhile I certainly can understand why this perp fled it goes to show that with everyone posting everything on the Internet the days of actually doing research and recon are gone All thats necessary now is really to just comb and put puzzles together by checking IG SC FB and other social media platformsPeople willingly post everything and anything these daysLook the guy may be guilty as sin with this Racoon thing however having authorities follow my movements because I have a selfie with stacks of cash I want to have stacks of cash Pile them high in my room and let me swim in them That is not a reason to begin tracking someone There has to be something else that someone is not speaking about BrianAs to Ukraine I have no love for Putin But if he eliminates the Nazi party that took over Ukraine in a coup in 2015 so much the better I know ethnic Russians that were under the recent Nazi party fire-bombings in Western Ukraine and Crimea It was horrid what they were doing to their own citizens for me it is on the same level with the Syrian regime and Aleppo I just want any action to not harm any innocent civilians just kill off the Nazis Unfortunately with all the money and military hardware pouring into the Nazis coffers that is not going to happen Welcome to the topsy-turvey world where the West supports the Nazis and their new holocaust programme against a dictator who I remind you has nukes And is being goaded into using them by a moronic idiotWell remember all Russians are NazisThey signed a peace treaty with Hitler exterminated Jews and did nothing to help win WW IIPutin is well known for his collection of Nazi memorabilia and wearing an SS uniform at homeWhen you have to use obviously false statements to prop up a dictatorshipyoure a dorkYes and the earth is flat and Santa Claus is real tooEvery military in the world has a few nazisConcernedThe article states the cash in hand photo was as a result of a subpoena which almost certainly means the subpoena included all contents from this guys iCloud account and the photo was just part of the contents The investigators were already on his trail As for the Nazis in Ukraine why would such Nazis allow Zelensky a Jew to lead their countryPerhaps they embrace DIE Diversity Inclusivity Equity ideology more than their Nazism allow Zelensky a Jewhahahahahaha what did you smokeThere are no Nazi parties in Ukraine Russia is actively introducing this idea to the world community Please study the material about it carefullyIts so true RTFM is such a clue Just read the M as inforMation and not just Manual D How could any reading-able including all getting to the core of the information without own reading ability person ever come to the conclusion the nazi-story could be trueLet me take a short and simple recap of information i studiedPutina almost wrote Russia but my believes are that most of the Russians werent into that took Crimea never mentioned just one Nazi for that Putina invaded Ukraine couple of years later - then Ukraine fires back Timeline is showing who is the aggressor Naming the action a special operation while forbidding the war-narrative is more nazi-like then everything i saw Ukraine is doingI have no love for Putin But -phrase needs autoflaggedI have no love for Putin simps -the autocorrected verbage But if he eliminates the Nazi party that took over Ukraine in a coup in 2015Hey kremlebot are they still paying you for posting this nonsense I didnt know the troll factory is still in operationBrian theyre using your site to perpetuate disinformation that creates social unrest out of thin airQuestionWhats the exchange rate for rubles to USDlike 100 to 1 or something like thatIts in the 60s Down a bit from before April Not the most comfortable asswipethese questions are just indicative how clueless about whole situation you areYou can just google USDRUB exchange rate on Google and easily see that it is better than before 24 FebYIKESWhen Russians refer to Nazi coup what they mean is a free election held to replace the disgraced pro-Russian president found to have stolen 15 billion There were 2 additional elections since then with the current administration being a Jewish former comedian The argument that Putin is a dictator with nukes would seem to imply Russia is a threat and that NATO and Ukraine needs more funding so good argument thanks The firebombings he may be referring to were in Odessa not west Ukraine which was stoked by armed Russian citizens in the region not Ukrainians Russia has bombed their liberated ethnic Russian cities to the ground having poured thousands of civilians into mass graves and then conscripted the young men such as Sokolovsky to become cannon meat as they put it on the front to be shot in the back by the FSBKGB if they attempt to retreat hence its Russia depopulating the region I dont know of any significant issues in Crimea prior to the covert Russian invasion of the peninsula hence hes lying when he knows someone who experienced them thereDo you live in a cave or something I am afraid according to the European Union the Nazi party is Kremlin and their propaganda its pretty official at this point Russia is going to have to pay for all of the missile strikes destroyed life and none of the propaganda is going to helpInstead of fighting to protect his own country from invading Russian forces Sokolvsky wimped out and left the country like a coward What a loser Good to see that Apple threw him under the bus The Government link for racoon does not work here in Indonesia is there a suffix miss off it pleaseOutstanding coverage Brian Well donePeople I use Apple and not Google because Apple respects my privacy and wont let the feds have my dataApple Well actually they just need a warrant and we hand it over soFeds And we can gin up a warrant for almost any reason Try usSpoken like a true conspiracy theorist who has no clue about how Law Enforcement actually worksSuuuurrre we have nothing better to do than to gin up a warrantI believe your tin foil hat is on too tightIt doesnt matter what country these depraved criminals are from Ukraine Russia Nigeria whatever If they are destroying peoples lives by stealing their lifes savings they deserve much more than 20 years in some gulag maybe even capital punishmentThis in turn piece has a tendency to redeem considerable potential customers How you would support it Getting this done offers a cool uncommon perspective in issues I suppose utilizing anything at all legitimate possibly major to convey home elevators is the most essential considerationI happen to live in Rome Italy Back in the early days of the war my wife and I were heading north on the A1 I recall at a toll intersection the car in front of us was taking a while to pay the toll and the people were out of their car trying to figure it out If I recall the car was a Porsche Cayenne and we were struck by the young age of the male driver and young blond woman and that the plate or some other marking indicated the car was from Ukraine My wife and I talked about it at length because we thought Why isnt this guy back in Ukraine to fight and instead is driving a super nice car in Italy I cant ever know for sure whether the two are one and the same but it seems coincidental assuming he was actually in Italy at this point in time Not that it matters but I could probably go back to any credit cardfuel charges back in March to see where the location was more specifically Definitely 2 to 3 hours north from RomeThat guy stole 50 million credentials but somehow the comment section is about Putin and talks it as if his worst crime is draft evasion Can you just stop plastering your fcking Ukrainian propaganda everywhereagreed maybe a suitable punishment would be to deliver him back to Ukraine handcuffed from 15000 feetI see no reason to waist resources on a punk that steals from all abandons his family and country Just end himGuy didnt just evade the draft he abandoned his elderly mother and the rest of his family to the tender mercies of Russian artillery while he and his girlfriend went on a joyride across Europe Providing a service used to rip off strangers thousands of miles away might seem dry and distant The way he treated family makes his scumbaggery more immediate and relatableRe the comment section being about Putin draft evasion I see exactly one comment like that from Sunshine State Everything else seems to be in response to posts from the Ukraine doesnt really exist and Jews are the real Nazis trollsEveryone is everything since the beginning of timeAll colors all ethnicities all religions are all the sameThe human being in a MatrixEnjoy your life until the next Onemr crabplease write about julius kivimakithank youSources tell KrebsOnSecurity that Sokolovsky has been
